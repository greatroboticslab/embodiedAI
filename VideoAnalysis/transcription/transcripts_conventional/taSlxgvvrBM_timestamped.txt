[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:07.940] One of the most common feedback control algorithms is proportional integral derivative control, or PID control for short.
[00:00:08.540 → 00:00:14.720] It's called a feedback control algorithm because sensor feedback is used to help determine the control signal.
[00:00:15.320 → 00:00:22.860] As an example, let's say that I'm trying to control the angle of my arm, and my control is the torque that I apply at the shoulder.
[00:00:23.420 → 00:00:28.520] Maybe I want to hold the arm at 90 degrees, and it's currently sitting at 45 degrees.
[00:00:28.520 → 00:00:35.900] So then I would define the error as being 90 degrees minus 45 degrees, or 45 degrees of error.
[00:00:36.280 → 00:00:39.000] So let's give variables to those.
[00:00:39.360 → 00:00:44.920] We'll call U the control signal, or the torque to the motor.
[00:00:46.640 → 00:00:56.700] And the error is called E, and that's just the desired output value minus the actual.
[00:00:58.520 → 00:00:59.200] Okay.
[00:01:00.000 → 00:01:12.720] So with these definitions of variables, we can write the PID controller as simply U is equal to, the control is equal to, KP times E.
[00:01:12.720 → 00:01:38.340] So KP is the proportional gain times the error, plus the integral gain, KI, times the integral of the error as a function of time, plus KD, which is the derivative gain, times the derivative of error as a function of time.
[00:01:38.340 → 00:01:39.340] Okay.
[00:01:39.340 → 00:01:44.600] So the KP times E term, that's actually acting like a spring.
[00:01:44.600 → 00:01:55.960] So if there's an error of 45 degrees from where I actually am to where I want to be, we multiply that by the proportional constant, KP, and that gives us a torque.
[00:01:56.200 → 00:01:57.800] So it's acting just like a spring.
[00:01:57.940 → 00:02:00.960] It acts on position error to try to reduce it.
[00:02:00.960 → 00:02:05.580] This term here, K sub D, acts like a damper.
[00:02:05.740 → 00:02:12.680] So if the error is increasing, then it tries to create a force to make that rate of error decrease.
[00:02:13.120 → 00:02:18.620] And if the error is decreasing, then it's going to act to slow down the rate of decrease.
[00:02:18.620 → 00:02:22.280] So we get to error equals zero without overshooting.
[00:02:22.280 → 00:02:25.100] So this is acting like a mechanical spring.
[00:02:25.260 → 00:02:28.200] This is acting like a mechanical damper in terms of error.
[00:02:29.140 → 00:02:33.420] And this integral term is a little bit harder to come up with a mechanical analog for.
[00:02:33.780 → 00:02:35.200] But here's the basic idea.
[00:02:35.320 → 00:02:48.260] If the arm has been sitting here with an error from the desired angle for some time, then this error is going to be integrating up over time, creating a larger and larger torque that tries to push the arm upward.
[00:02:48.260 → 00:02:53.160] So this integral term here is to try to get rid of steady state error.
[00:02:53.480 → 00:02:55.600] And we'll see that more in examples later.
[00:02:56.040 → 00:03:04.660] This is called a linear control law because the control value U is linear in the error, the integral of the error, and the derivative of the error.
[00:03:05.360 → 00:03:10.240] If we want to implement that in a computer, we can look at pseudocode.
[00:03:11.620 → 00:03:15.800] So first we initialize the value of the integral of the error.
[00:03:15.920 → 00:03:17.020] We initialize it to zero.
[00:03:17.020 → 00:03:22.940] And we're going to differentiate numerically the error currently from the previous error.
[00:03:23.060 → 00:03:26.500] So we're going to initialize the previous error as zero.
[00:03:27.200 → 00:03:31.180] And now we go into this control loop that gets executed every dt seconds.
[00:03:31.820 → 00:03:35.940] So typically for motor control, that might be every one millisecond, for example.
[00:03:36.620 → 00:03:43.980] So every one millisecond, we're going to go in and calculate the error, which is the desired position minus the position that we read from a sensor.
[00:03:43.980 → 00:03:52.760] Then we can calculate the derivative of the error by taking the current error, subtracting the previous error, and dividing by the time step.
[00:03:53.220 → 00:03:54.660] So now we've got E dot.
[00:03:55.340 → 00:04:03.760] And to calculate the integral of the error, we just take the previous integral of the error and add to it the current error times the time step dt.
[00:04:03.760 → 00:04:08.760] So this is a simple numerical integration scheme, simple numerical differentiation scheme.
[00:04:08.760 → 00:04:15.040] And then finally down here, we calculate u according to the control law that we just gave.
[00:04:15.940 → 00:04:21.440] Then, so the next time we can get the right numerical derivative, we set E previous equal to the current error.
[00:04:21.440 → 00:04:27.040] And then we send the control output, for example, the torque to the motor.
[00:04:27.040 → 00:04:28.040] Then we make the right numericalynamic generator.
[00:04:28.040 → 00:04:30.340] So let's go ahead and manage the error.
[00:04:30.860 → 00:04:32.600] So this is the way we are currently able to activate the error.
[00:04:33.320 → 00:04:35.760] If there is a follow up button, if there is mandate E, the capacity or use the rpm, the drift method here is called the drive priority for example.
[00:04:36.480 → 00:04:37.420] So, it might be helpful.
