[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:07.880] Hey what's happening guys I thought today we might talk about this little guy right here
[00:00:07.880 → 00:00:23.060] this chip this strange looking chip is the TDA 2030 which is a class AB amplifier chip
[00:00:23.060 → 00:00:30.860] now if you think back to the times we've talked about amplifiers a class a
[00:00:30.860 → 00:00:38.180] amplifier which is the most linear but the least efficient operates for the
[00:00:38.180 → 00:00:48.260] entire sine wave cycle from 0 to 360 degrees a class B amplifier operates on
[00:00:48.260 → 00:00:58.660] only half the signal either from 0 to 180 or 181 to 360 it's more efficient but it
[00:00:58.660 → 00:01:04.160] is hardly linear and not very useful in audio because it's going to produce some
[00:01:04.160 → 00:01:11.840] distortions but if you take the class A and the class B and you kind of put them
[00:01:11.840 → 00:01:17.440] together you get a class AB amplifier which is also known as a push-pull
[00:01:17.440 → 00:01:26.560] amplifier and its characteristic is it is almost as linear as a class A amplifier
[00:01:26.560 → 00:01:34.420] because it operates for more than 180 degrees but less than 360 so instead of
[00:01:34.420 → 00:01:39.040] being on all the time getting hot and wasting power it's off for a small part
[00:01:39.040 → 00:01:45.700] of the cycle and that works out pretty well now what we were talking about is
[00:01:45.700 → 00:01:58.460] this little guy here this is the TDA 2030 and it's from ST.com now has a wide voltage
[00:01:58.460 → 00:02:04.820] supply up to 36 volts but you have to go that high it will operate as low as 6 volts but
[00:02:04.820 → 00:02:11.700] 12 volts is a good place to start single or split supply that means if you think of
[00:02:11.700 → 00:02:24.460] this somewhat as an op amp you can operate as an op amp with a plus vs and a minus vs but
[00:02:24.460 → 00:02:32.340] it's not necessary you can operate it with a single supply as well it has short circuit protection and a
[00:02:32.340 → 00:02:39.460] thermal out or a thermal shut down you see typically it provides 14 outputs of power
[00:02:39.460 → 00:02:47.100] now that of course depends on your input voltage the impedance of the speaker and
[00:02:47.100 → 00:02:55.920] those sorts of things but this is a really oh this by the way this package with the five leads is called the
[00:02:55.920 → 00:03:05.680] pentawatt package just thought I'd throw that in there so a couple more things to talk about with this amplifier
[00:03:05.680 → 00:03:21.680] here are some of its electrical characteristics so supply voltage a plus or minus 18 or 36 volts input voltage
[00:03:21.680 → 00:03:27.860] blah blah blah blah so here we go come down here and we talk about our supply voltage
[00:03:27.860 → 00:03:37.240] minimum six we build something we build with probably 12 volts and its quiescent current drain is 40 milliamps
[00:03:37.240 → 00:03:45.760] that's not that small so this thing's going to drain power even when it's using that's the class a part of the amplifier in there it's always working
[00:03:45.760 → 00:03:56.440] now our input bias is 0.2 to 2 microamps and our offset voltage is plus 2 to plus 20 millivolts
[00:03:56.440 → 00:04:00.400] couple things to keep in mind
[00:04:00.400 → 00:04:13.040] it's pretty good on distortion half a percent now our frequency response our minus 3 dB so this is basically we'll call it the low cut frequency
[00:04:13.040 → 00:04:20.320] the low cut frequency is 10 to 140 hertz depending on how you set it up that's great for audio stuff
[00:04:20.320 → 00:04:28.680] drain current 900 500 let's split the difference call it 600 milliamps
[00:04:28.680 → 00:04:32.500] okay so what I've done here
[00:04:32.500 → 00:04:35.980] is I have drawn up
[00:04:35.980 → 00:04:38.780] a single supply
[00:04:38.780 → 00:04:46.460] class a B amplifier here and I thought we'd talk about it and go over it
[00:04:46.460 → 00:04:53.180] so the first thing I want to talk about are the resistors and if we start with RA
[00:04:55.420 → 00:05:04.140] and RB these are our inverting or our yeah and our inverting and non-inverting
[00:05:04.140 → 00:05:13.820] non-inverting input biasing now we're going to run these at a hundred K each
[00:05:13.820 → 00:05:27.180] now if you go higher than that you're going to have poor frequency attenuation and if you go lower in
[00:05:27.180 → 00:05:34.860] that you could end up getting into some sort of oscillation
[00:05:34.860 → 00:05:43.820] next up we have R3 and this is our non-inverting input bias as well so it's also going to be
[00:05:43.820 → 00:05:53.740] 100 K now R4 this one over here is our for frequency stability and it is just going to be
[00:05:53.740 → 00:06:01.420] 1 ohm so the reason that we want to have that is just to keep everything stable if you increase
[00:06:01.420 → 00:06:08.140] the value of that you could have oscillation at higher frequencies if you decrease it probably
[00:06:08.140 → 00:06:11.420] not much going to happen but you're at 1 ohm how low are you going to go right
[00:06:11.420 → 00:06:18.860] okay next up we have R1 which is this guy right here
[00:06:20.940 → 00:06:27.100] and R2 where is R2 R2 where are you oh sorry we didn't use R2 that's for the um
[00:06:28.860 → 00:06:37.260] double supply so R1 is our closed loop gain setting and the value we're going to put here is 150 K
[00:06:37.260 → 00:06:43.260] if you increase it you get an increase in gain if you decrease it you get a decrease in gain so
[00:06:43.260 → 00:06:52.380] you know you can see it's pretty easy all right let's talk capacitors then capacitor C1 right here
[00:06:54.940 → 00:07:03.260] this is going to be that's more right at one microfarad and that's going to be our non-inv
[00:07:03.260 → 00:07:11.100] I can't talk our input DC decoupling it was going to that non-inverter that's why I was getting myself
[00:07:11.100 → 00:07:18.300] confused so this is just to decouple any DC that's coming in on our input this is our input right here
[00:07:19.020 → 00:07:27.180] and also you know you would also have to have the other half of the signal the ground now C2 is our
[00:07:27.180 → 00:07:36.060] inverting input decoupling it's going to be 22 microfarad
[00:07:39.100 → 00:07:46.460] if you increase it you increase oh sorry if you decrease it you increase the low frequency cutoff so
[00:07:47.340 → 00:07:51.180] you know you can play around with those values a little bit
[00:07:51.180 → 00:08:07.820] C3 and C5 the this is a 0.1 put the point on the right side there Paul 0.1 and 100 microfarad now
[00:08:07.820 → 00:08:13.420] you've seen those numbers a lot of times you know exactly what they mean those are our supply voltage
[00:08:13.420 → 00:08:23.660] bypasses and we come down here to C7 which is 0.22 microfarad and C7 is used for frequency stability
[00:08:24.220 → 00:08:31.100] it's just keeping our frequency stable you change it you can end up with oscillation and C8
[00:08:31.100 → 00:08:49.900] this guy right here is our upper frequency cutoff and it's going to be 2200 microfarad probably could go up to 3300
[00:08:52.460 → 00:08:57.340] if you increase it you decrease your bandwidth if you decrease it you increase your bandwidth
[00:08:57.340 → 00:09:05.420] so oh and let's not forget our diodes diode 1 and diode 2 they can be pretty much anything so we'll
[00:09:05.420 → 00:09:16.860] use like a 1N4001 and they simply prevent voltage spikes from hitting the uh this is the plus v and
[00:09:16.860 → 00:09:25.100] this is the minus v so it simply prevents voltage spikes from hitting the power supply to the TDA2030 chip
[00:09:27.340 → 00:09:36.540] 0.32 microfarad now if you put a uh 4 ohm resistor on 4 ohm resistor on 4 ohm resistor a 4 ohm speaker
[00:09:38.540 → 00:09:45.500] you're going to get one thing if you put 8 ohms on you're going to get a different thing that will
[00:09:45.500 → 00:09:52.540] affect the gain that will affect the power output because ohms law you change the resistance in this
[00:09:52.540 → 00:09:59.300] this case impedance, then it affects both your voltage and your current as well.
[00:10:00.260 → 00:10:00.780] Alright?
[00:10:02.520 → 00:10:09.520] Alright, you guys think about this for today, and tomorrow we'll build the circuit and try
[00:10:09.520 → 00:10:09.980] it out, alright?
[00:10:11.200 → 00:10:11.760] Alright.
[00:10:12.280 → 00:10:13.320] Hope you guys enjoyed.
