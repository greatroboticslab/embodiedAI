But how do we determine what is and isn't a tweeter then?\nThe answer is actually pretty simple. Size. To produce a high frequency noise, the speaker must move extremely quickly,\nand a small speaker is much easier to vibrate fast enough to produce those higher frequencies than a large speaker.\nAnd though there isn't a specific size that quantifies a speaker as a tweeter, tweeters are usually going to be the smallest speaker on a particular audio setup.",

They are sub or below a woofer, and the typical frequency range of a subwoofer is 20 to 200 Hertz,\nmaking it a perfect organ shaker for a variety of purposes, from raging parties to casual drives to work in your Alpine-sponsored 98 Civic.\nOf course, not every application of subwoofers is ridiculous. When they're not configured to overpower everything else,\nthey are an essential component of a well-balanced speaker system that adds impact and depth to the explosions in your movies and the bass in your music.\nIn a home theater, the subwoofer is usually situated in its own separate enclosure, and because it's designed to move large amounts of air with strong, slow, accurate vibrations,\nit usually uses its own power source to maintain a reasonable listening volume while doing so.\nSo there you have it. Why do we need different types of speakers? Well, because with only one type, we would be limiting our ability to represent the full range of human hearing accurately,\nmaking for a much less satisfying experience for audio enthusiasts everywhere.\nAnd speaking of cruel sponsors, today's episode sponsors Fractal Design, and instead of having me talk about their, you know,",
