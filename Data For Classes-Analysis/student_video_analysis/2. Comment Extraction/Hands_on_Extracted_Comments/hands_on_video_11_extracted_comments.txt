Hlo sir jo cob light aap nay use Kiya hai agr ham innhe cob lights ka use kar-k 30w ki light banaye too kisay banaye laikin wo cob lights 3w 12v ki use karni hai aur 12v lithium battery pack ka istemal karna hai aur wo light heat nahi hona chahiye taki uski life achi ho.  Please reply zoroor karna sir, Uss mai hamay konsi resistance use karni hai yaa resistance use karni chahiye yaa nahi heat sink use karni hai yaa nahe aur 12v 40a lithium battery ka use karsakte hai ki nahi. Please answer

This is really informative. Despite knowing what an Arduino is, binary and mostly everything your talking about I still found it satisfying to watch it's conveyed really well

How do I get the cvzone library for Arduino?

can we romouve the percentage that showed on the screen ?

it takes 20 seconds for the python to reflect the val

Sir, how can i fix the lagging with the communication between arduino and python IDE?

for those who can not detect their arduino board in paython, check if you already closed your serial monitor in arduino IDE. maybe it happens with MacOS only.

where can i find the CVZONE DOWNLOAD LINK?

great sir just want ask you, how to intergrate python and arduino for face-detection to mark attendance

Can I use arduino camera module for it

your explanation is very Good, for Beginners

the python code is running on your computer or in the microcontroller?

Can we use this program in Vscode instead of pycharm? Please lemme know.

this has nothing to do with face detection

hey I needed your help with one of my college project is there any way I can get in touch with you?

ilysm <3

Nerds have killed their profession. Now go coding for dish of rice.

I love the Tutorial video. Please can you make a full tutorial video on Arduino UNO

OpenCV course ❌Serial Communication course ✅  But it is best course 👍👍

HELP!!! I'm following your video at 59:51, my python code is not working.  My computer can connect with Arduino. "Arduino Uno (COM4) Connected" from cvzone.SerialModule import SerialObject  from time import sleep  arduino = SerialObject() # while True:     arduino.sendData([1])     sleep(2)     arduino.sendData([0])     sleep(1)

On the computer.( desktop)

Yes

The title says "Computer vision" and the topic is in general, and shows different abilities that the Arduino can handle integrated with Python on the desktop.

56:36 my arduino isnt connected to a port, it says its connected to /dev/cu.usbmodem14101 but when i put that in it still wouldnt connect? can you help

Most interesting.  🥳 I wonder if this is a good project to learn the newer $74  Arduino GIGA R1 WiFi & Bluetooth and OpenCV with a touch display shield?    😎  Thank you.

Misleading title. It should be "interaction between arduino and host computer running a CV app". Obviously there is no CV application running in the arduino platform.

When I try pot graphics  code, the value is lagging  in pycharm,  I dont how to fix this, I am using  arduino  mega

Hi sir having difficulty in adding cvzone zip file in mac systems...How to add in mac...It works for me in Windows...

Sir please give me cvzone library

That's awesome what you did but how can it be made to train the program to recognize for different objects, for example a chair and power on the red led for exapmle and if it recognize a phone, to power on the blue led?

Superb sir!

Can you please share link of the library. I am unable to download from the link in description.

Can we make a robot by image Recognition and command to move forward ?

This guy would use a arduino uni to make a rocke defense system

Hi brother! Great detailed stuff on Drone and Arduino as well. One question please.  In this video, is the Python code running on the computer and UNO is also connected to same  computer ? Only then data can be passed through SerialObject between these ? Apps (UNO) in this video can't run on battery I think as we need serial connectivity  for Python CV apps ?

the cvzone website login page is not working

I love your course. I was able to get Arduino code working at 51:35 when using the Serial Monitor, but at 59:17 could get my LED on.  Pycharm works, it says Serial Device Connected but the LED of Arduino does not change to on. Any idea? Thanks!

Simply great. Thank you for sharing.

It's a great tutorial! Thank you!

What is his major?

Wow! 50:38  58:05  59:10

Like it

where can I find the cvzone library? I cant seem to find it on the website

I walked in with the same intention and later realised that it was for integration of messages onto Arduino from Python code, and not really image recognition ON the Arduino .

Got it. Earlier I was unable to download the code, but after making account on your wesite one can easily download the cvzone zip library. 🙏

I found out that I had to write all the argument into the SerialObject... (port, baudrate, digits, max_retires). So I just finished your 2hrs course with success! Thanks a lot for all this knowlegde!

Sir, super lessons. Thank you so much.

please stop leaving old useless outdated videos like this on the internet!!! it became worthless around half hour when the ide stopped matching the ide from the download !!! there is a bunch of these opencv vids that are old outdated and useless on the internet!!! if you do update this video please make one link to get all pycharm  , python , your version of opencv all correct versions and leave the runing instructions. another thing this is not computer programing lessons its instructions to attempt to run an application program!!! your wasting peoples time with this video!

Where will I get this cvzone library

Hi Murtaza, can you tell me the name of the rolling belt, which you used for the color software. Or maybe a link for this product ? This is, what i am looking for.

Sir the link for cvzone is not opening.

just thank you:face-red-heart-shape:

How to download that CVzone zip file, please provide link here

Thank you very much

Awesome material

or this header file is only avaliable for who have joined the course.

how can I get this cvzone.h (header file).

CVZone library is not free?

Can I use a mu vision sensor?

i have a question. Are there any relations between arduino code and pycharm code, or just the arduino board itself and the pycharm code ? thank you so much !

I searched alot on internet but I couldn't find the course I want unti I saw this...🇮🇷❤

28:06  why this version?

Where can I get the cvzone package for Arduino

sir plz provide your contact details

can anyone give me cvzone.zip file directly

Sir Hindi language plz

Great job, my friend!

Bro if we want to code python we wanta a computer,but can we rub computer vision directly on arduino

Hey sir! Love your content. I need your guidance while developing body posture detection system.

doubt: how does python know which pins to send data to like in arduino ide code we set pins in void setup() or digitalWrite(pin,value) but in python we just send data in a list??? please help I'm a beginner

Arduino is so expensive and so underpowered that this is a  massive waste of effort.  I don't understand why it's so popular when it's such a needlessly nerfed piece of tech.  There are SO many other micros out there with ten or a hundred times the capability in packages a third the size and a fifth the cost.  I really don't understand the attraction of Arduino....  Also, this is shameless clickbait.  The Arduino is not running OpenCV.

very clear minded person. good luck

Thank you!  I was so confused by where the numbers were coming from for programming my Arduino, the other videos I've watched don't even acknowledge what anything in the code means if they even show it.  Thank you so much, finally a good explanation of what is going on!!

I just can't add cvzone to myproject!!what happened?

I appreciate the education but please for your own health drink a glass of water

where do i find the cvzone  zip file for arduino?? cann anyone tell me plzzz

🧡💚💛💙

That was deceptive, you said you were going to use the Arduino to do face tracking and hand gesture detection. Instead you used your PC to do it and just blinked a light on the Arduino. Nobody should pay for these courses.

Give us an example of the microcontroller you mean

is for beginners you mega mind. Easy to use and looks appealing while also having its own IDE just to run it, whereas if you used a smaller micro-controller it would require way more effort to code it.

Actually the reason I opened the video was to check what's wrong with it. As I remember, arduinos have like coule KB of RAM. And I was curious, what exactly author means by CV on Arduino. Your comment let me skip the video :)

Not deceptive, it still fits the theme.  Nobody is paying for it, it is a free video. Maybe you just want to be spoon fed instead of actually learning the skills that have been taught and applying it into ur own project that u intended

Very easy to follow guide, thanks a lot.

The Arduino isn't doing ANY of the "computer vision" part of this setup. Correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like it simply turns on a light when your Windows Computer, that has a camera attached, detects a face and then sends a signal via serial out to the Arduino.   I think the title of this video is misleading.

Thank you so much, sir.🙏

How to make a nuclear reactor with a hammer, 10 nails and a piece of wood. How come nobody else have made face recognition with an Arduino?

I did the potentiometer graphics, but it is not smooth. and the serial monitor in pycharm also doesnt react swiftly, it feels like data is not sending or recieving correctly, any ideas how to solve?

Drawing hand animation I bet needed a lot of work but doesn't improve the video. In fact, it's even a bit annoying.

Thanks a lot. Been using Arduino's since the very beginning, and yet I'm still learning a lot of new stuff here. This is exactly what I've been missing. I had to do computer vision in the past with RGB sensors, because I didn't know how to crunch the video feed. This helps a ton.

the definition of "digital" and "analog" in this video gave several electrical engineers a stroke.....

I cannot acces the libraray code. Can you please share the code? I have a project for school and I have to send it tomorrow.

what about mac users? I have my arduino connected to port /dev/cu.usbmodem2114401 and it works fine with using the Arduino IDE but when working with PyCharm I keep getting "Arduino Not Found. Please enter COM Port Number instead." and if I manually enter the port I then get a "Serial Device Not Connected" message

I've been using Arduinto to help me debug existing product hardware. I wanted a simple, quick I2C interface to talk devices independent of the FPGA that normally drives the board.  I've found that Arduino saves library files in THREE different places on a Windows 10 computer. I'll list them out to help reinforce my own memory: 1) C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries 2) Documents\Arduino  (for whatever YOURusername is) 3)  C:\Users\YOURusername\AppData\Local\Arduino15 It's important to know these directories working with Arduino, or it will drive you crazy trying to uninstall libraries you DON'T want.

Wow! Skipped up to see what you had for the OpenCV topics. I have to say you really do have the best tutorial and best teaching method I've ever seen. Thanks for explaining it all in a technically simplistic, clear and non BS filled manner. Superb, you get 5 gold stars, heck 10 golds! Nicely done, very nicely done.

sir you're overcomplicating the examples

great course

I've never seen the best way of teaching like this. Thank you, sir!

You are the best person of the world.

Thank you this video was very helpful and easy to understand ❤

Excellent tutorial!

This video is so helpful!!!

I have a question. What could be considered pros-cons if instead of using this library, the Arduino is reading/writing to serial while a Python program is doing the same while communicating through same port with the Arduino?

Great courses. Thank you very much 💗

vert=y== goodf\ :D

I am soo lucky that youtube recommended this video when i am scrolling to learn something. The way you teached made me understood very well. Thank you soo much sir 💖

Title is kind of misleading though. The arduino is being used as an external IO board. You could just as well print in a console "face detected" or "face not detected" since the pc running the python scripts is the one doing the computer vision work.

This is really informative. Despite knowing what an Arduino is, binary and mostly everything your talking about I still found it satisfying to watch it's conveyed really well

All of this for free. What a world are we living in!

Imagine he wanted a keyless bike and indeed he did it but one day lost his phone. What will he do then?

Very point less.

Thanks sir, I've an issue with downloading cvzone library. Could anyone upload it to google drive and post the link. Thanks in advance.

Bro please made a advanced course on this topic PYTHON WITH ARDUINO

Thank you. This video helped me gain way better understanding.

This has nothing to do with computer vision !

Dude you need to get your volume the  same as commercials and I can't hear most of the words that you say it's very mumbled  and then you trail off  at the ends of your sentences its the way you talk you should get someone else to read it at first I was trying to turn the volume up but then you say some of your first words really louder then when the adds come on wow I really dont want to go but I can't figure out what to you say half of the time

Many thanks for your effort on sharing this. When I could turn on and turn off a LED through python I was really excited and wrote this message heheh. I´ll keep going 😁

Can we do hand gestures detection using cvzone package?? Please help

AttributeError: 'SerialObject' object has no attribute 'getData'

شرح ممتاز 👏🏻 ان شاء الله يجي اليوم الي أكون بي مبرمج ذكاء اصطناعي والكترونيات

Nice and helpful tutorial.❤❤

This is SONAR ??? - No vision ... !

I think you explain very well and very clean with your visual elements... But why in CV is used Python mostly and what abour C++ ?

You are one of best teacher ♥️♥️♥️....

Good explanation

Could you please share your email ID..... I have a query to share

I remember like 15 years ago i tried to make some project on atmega8. I installed avrstudio, programming device, and made simple circuit wit led just for test if everythink working fine. But unfortunately i got some error on avrstudio and i had no idea what is it about. It cost me very long and frustrating investigation. Finaly after two weeks i saw the led blinking.

Interesting video. Well done ! I use Ubuntu 20.04 with Visual Studio code. (Don't have Windows) At position 1.50:52 in your video, code <arduino.sendData([1])>, I get: WARNING:  root:Arduino Not Found. Please enter COM Port Number instead.  I suppose the reason is that I use Linux i.s.o. Windows.  Any suggestion how to solve this issue? In cvzone.SerialModule in Python? in <cvzone.h> in Arduino?

thank you so much

Sir you are doing a great job! Thanks. You bring the easy explanation for noob like us.

cvzone python package taking too much time to install, and then I am running out of my mobile data, is there any alternate way to manually download the package and then include it , please help🙏🙏🙏

great lesson!

I was expecting something different, however it's just simple serial communication 51:25. It won't even need any fancy library, simple read and write on Arduino serial port, and do whatever accordingly using python.👍🤣

It didn't work for me:  WARNING:root:Serial Device Not Connected Traceback (most recent call last): data = self.ser.readline()  AttributeError: 'SerialObject' object has no attribute 'ser'

Thanks for sharing! I learned a lot! Thank you very much!

Let's say that the title is clickbait, he's using a a python script with opencv and sending data to arduino as an actuator (led). It is more "computer vision with pc and connect arduino". These days we can have a neural network on an arduino ble sense 33 (that device can really perform cv and other tasks autonomusly) Nice video tho, the intro to arduino is super.

The easiest solution was (for me) to use pyserial. I replaced : arduino.sendData([1]) by arduino.write(b'$1')

super, very good explanation, thanks a lot

How do i install the cvzone zip file?

MASHAALLAH Brother <3

Truly epic video! Many thanks for helping me understand things I would never have chance to understand.

Best Teacher ever!!

Thank you for this vividly video！

How if we want to use external camera instead of laptop camera?

can anyone teach me where to dowload cvzone.zip for adruino at 34:40? Thanks

Thank you for providing this tutorial. The video is jam-packed with simple but powerful insights.

can anyone tell me from where can I download the zip file of cvzone??

Good stuff bro

import cv2 from cvzone.FaceDetectionModule import FaceDetector cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)  detector = FaceDetector()  while True:     success, img = cap.read()     img, bboxs = detector.findFaces(img)     cv2.imshow("image", img)     cv2.waitKey(1)  >>>>>   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cvzone'

Just curious any way to get just the center values of the bboxs? I want to be able to know if the face is to the left/right of the center for example

Great 👍

For those wondering how,... he serials some int's down the serial line to an arduino and all OpenCV/python runs on the PC.

Great video !

IoI very very good! I did it on my linux with some small changes to the code, and it turned out great! Congratulations on your didactic man! Amazing..thanks!!💻🖥⌨ 👏👏👏

Hey man i like your ideas and videos but there is a slight problem, Why you not prefer to use serial module of python to exchange data b/w python and arduino. These all stuff can also be achived by using serial module What's intresting in cvzone.

I am using pycharm on termux phone  , how I can make communication with Arduino using usb serial with termux api usb

Which roadmap should i follow to become a master like you ? :)

Can I send two different arrays from python to arduino sketches?

Thank you for this amazing video. But I have a problem When i run the python code, it doesn't work and it gives me an error "Warning: the serial device is not detected" and i connected the arduino port in the same port specified in the python code. What is the problem? Thanks for your considerations

The LEDs don't work once I upload framework. Please help.

nonsense from the first to the last minute. what's with the arduino? stupidly light up the diode on command sent via uart? and a lot of mind is needed to use ready-made algorithms? as a result, a piece of rubbish lasting two hours, with information content equal to zero !!

bro can you tell us how to display graphics from arduino to monitor.

sir my arduino is connected but the code is not run arduino board in pycharm ide

Thanks man!!! it was amazing

Dude you are the best Educator till now. Your knowledge and way of teaching is just remarkable

Hi! I had a similar issue, your port may not be the same as his, so you might want to check the port name on the Arduino in your Arduino IDE. I explain this a little bit in my Python + Arduino tutorial. 😀

Hm..? But doesn't this course teach u how to build a project to detect objects?

I'm agree - his explaining is super good

great work ! Can you also make a video on project with the help of Arduino DUE which has more computational power

very useful, The UNO board is on the way home:goodvibes:

simple to learn but great impact for me :), thanks.

Would I be able to utilize this same technology to run a DC motor for a fan using Hand Gestures?

its was awsome, please send us cvzone.h library

Dear Sir, please recommend or advice.. I want  to create a system based on Arduino components and stepper motors along with other components so that the stepper motor ON and OFF is triggered in the voltage or amperage range (Min, Max) from other systems. Thank You

Instead pycharm can I use visual studio code

The video is going great but I’m unable to include the library. It’s saying file does not contain a valid library. Anyone to kindly help me?

my final year project is based on your course thanks a lot and we included you as a honorary  mention and as a mentor

where is cvzone libarary

sensor -> mcu -> light wow very cool    i can do this with an opamp smh  the digital and analog fan example is misleading the uno doesnt do dac, it does pwm, which is still digital, u can switch it on and off, but fast, in 256 switches, you have 128 on and 128 off intertwined, then thats half speed but a pwm is just how long on and off stays, in a 1 second, u have 0.5 second on and 0.5 second off, then thats half speed, and it repeats  just saying

sir password???

Excellent. Fluent persistent explanation . I like it. Thank you. As a small note or observation: it equals to or is equal to

Asslam-u-Alaikum we are doing a project on this Domaine and hardly need some help, if any one could help me it would be very nice 👍 specifically real time image processing.

A LED can have more than a state, not just on and off, you can dimmer it via software

I bought a raspberry pi 4 , after a couple of day of getting used to it, i wonder why every says it is superior to arduino. I bought a keyboard and mouse without wires, RF via USB transmitter, and , because of it's architecture, mouse speed can`t be modified. Response is slow, with an annoing delay, if raspberry is so wonderfull, why does this run slow ? these peripherics, connected to my laptop, work perfect.

Mind Blowing Course, thank you so much

Thank you very much sir you are such a great teacher thanks for teaching with such a beautiful manner

Super

Super

This is great video for me as well as others, Thank you bro for uploading this tutorial on youtube🙏🙏

I have never a God, however, I think I have found one!  Love you Murtaza!

Very informative video.thanks a lot. Also wanted to know if you have any material related to UART communication. wanted to know if i can give inputs from the digital pins and send output on uart based on the different values from the input pins

amazing content!

Hello. I have an error in the line img, bboxs = detector.findFaces(img) . It says it is a problem in bboxs and  don't know how to open img with PyCharm. Can you please, help me? Thank you.

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Awesome video. Thanks!

26:00

Brilliant tutorial vid

I have got an errore in "Potentiometer":  UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xf1 in position 0: invalid continuation byte How can I slove it

Follow the link in the description and login.

@murtazasworkshop  We should go to your website and resister/login to get the library??

@murtazasworkshop  Thank you for all the help. I successfully downloaded all the files from your website after signing up . I have been learning your CV arduino course for the past 3 days bit by bit. Thankyou very much for sharing your knowledge with us it had really helped me to know more about programming,arduino and computers. Waiting for next chapter on opencv with arduino. Actually I am really excited about that. Hope the video will be uploaded soon, Anyway thankyou again for all the help         "

​ @murtazasworkshop  I  did all the projects up to "potentiometer  Graphics". The potentiometer does not work as expected. I shown the image in the window but the problem is in getting value from arduino. I comes very late and the ecllipse also reacts very slow beacause of that. I even copied you program from the file you have given but that program also doesnt work. Could you please help me with this???

And when I remove the image and ecllipse the data is coming fine. What should I do??

check this too https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX38xR5hpks

Hello my friend this is very useful video . thaks for your sharings

excellent work

Do I need any prior coding language to study this? I am a graduate in biology and want to learn this

u should get more subscribers

Thanks you so much😉

Thanks you so much😉

This dude is amazing

9:16 that would be not correct with what is said here 2:59. Probably a simple mistake. Good introduction to Arduino overall. Good job!

This is the best training video I have ever seen in my life. I live in the UK but I believe this is the best all over the world

Something IS EQUAL or something EQUALS, not something "is equals"!!!

this arduino course not computer vision

Is it the same process to download the extensions when using VSCode

Great explanation

I didn't watch whole video, but can't wait to setup this with Arduino Nano ^.^

Amazing course. Thank you!

Amazing sir Sir are you have any  institute or office in Pakistan

Amazing !! Thank you

Could you create an arduino(hardware and programming w/python) course on its own please sir

Im very interested with this topic sir ,  Thankyou ☺️

Can you give me the code please?

if you don't watch the video, you will love it but if you watch the video, you will be sad about it cuz it doesn't have any valuable knowledge.

Bro, such a great video, thank you very much for this!!! I'm learning a lot, very precise content and very didactic 👏👏👏👌

@Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI   Ha-ha =))) 2:03:58 - it's NOT mistake of OpenCV. The OpenCV really found a face on the palm! Enable 0.25 speed in youtube and press pause when green LED will enable and in BOX wiil be 66-67% .  The FANTASTIC FACE!)

Thanks! Its a great course!!!

Great introduction to OpenCV library and Arduino-PC communication through USB port

Simple and fun. Thanks !

Where is the code?

suhuuuuuuu, thankyou

Really I have been waiting for this kind of explanation for several years and finally I found your YouTube channel.😅🙌

Nice content, I already know the stuff you are talking about, but I still liked to watch it.

Audrino kon sa hai bhai

@21:39 you say integer variables can not have decimal values. I think you will find that integer values are decimal values. You mean they can not have fractional values. Decimal just means base 10 maths (0 to 9), just like binary is base 2 (0 to 1)

The LED light is not a great example for digital output as it can also be analogue too. You have two ways to dim an LED light, digitally with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) or analogue by varying the voltage. It is the simplest to way to demonstrate a digital output, light on or off, but it should be clear that it's not just a digital output. A purely digital output would be something like controlling a solenoid or relay switch to turn something on or off.

how can i install cvzone in python , i have a lot of problem . can you help me please ???

2:01:24. I dont understand  if I write:  $000 the light turns off. $111 the light turns on.  Could anybody help me?

Insane !!! 🙄🙄😱

Amazing coarse

Why coudnt we use PyFirmata protocol flashed in Arduino and directly program Arduino with Python?

Thanks very much..... :)

Thanks for such a great course 💪🏼 But how to let this project run the green led only if a specific  face is detected?

you need to learn about machine learning. You will need to replace his detector in the python with your own detector. That requires you learn about machine learning in python such as tensorflow or pycharm. Good luck.

Guys kindly help me with cvzone library 🥺🙏🏾

Murtaza Bhai Urdu mai bhi video banae.

This is a clickbait video and title. The arduino does nothing but turning an LED on or off and everything else is one by the python code. Absolutely doesn't worth your time.

amazing course 👍👍

this is really amazing thank you for your hard work it is really an amazing usefull course 😍😍

Pls share product link of ARDUINO. It is not working...

The best one. Thank you 😊

Hey man, is that ok, if you make the realistic robot(humaniod), that would be better for younger generation like me. I have interest in robotics but don't know from where to start, so can u make a series or playlist to making robot step by step and do it as per u like, but sir can u do it. If u think this is very harsh than sorry.......😶

You deserve 100M subscribers.

Congrats. Great job.👍

The title of this video is misleading....

nice work man and i follow your page and i loved your work, i have a request that can you make a tutorial on how to detect deepfake content , how to build a model for that and something like that.

👍 from India.......

Перевёл бы кто на русский... 😔

Pls do python openCv 3d scanner programing  tutorials

before heading over to this advance python projects like the above and others such as AI mouse etc, which topics I need to cover first?  like here are some libraries to which i am not familiar with? please @murtaza help me with roadmap?

Awesome Course and so much Professional

Simply amazing

Nice video, thanks :)

amazing:washhands:

💵 muito bom vale 👮‍♀️ouro

Pin this. Comment plz.

I can provide you 200 views daily for evey video.

I can unfortunately just hit the like button. Thank you very much

Congratulations on 200K subscribers. I hope it reaches the 1M mark soon Thank you sir for bringing top-quality content.

MCU = marvel Cinematic  Universe, nothing else 😅

We did leds of these and we used scracht for it

it is really very much good explaining .wow reallay thank you

Huge Thanks for the course.🔥

Do you wish get me some ecample or advice for using arduino with inkjet printhead like code machine . ex print date on bottle...

You are awesome 👏, thank you

Very good tutorial, you earn a new suscriber, can I add diferent model cam to get better resolution in the image[fo example cognex,datalogics, or sony,canon, or go pro?  Thanks in advance

nice clickbait title, disliked.

Literally Its amazing.. Thank you so much. I want to make an project on CV with arduino and I want to compare  two hole which is small and which is big. Could you please help me in that I want to use only microcontroller without computer.

I haven't found the cvzone library, please help 🙏

Very dangerous  I bet there will be a nexus of Super quantum computer and Robots ..may God save humanity .

what should I know as prerequisites ? I know C and C++ . However I am saving the course

You can cut out the first 42 minutes of the video. Most people already know that stuff

u r lit man...more power to you

Crystal clear each every concept thanks a lot🙏

Unreal grate vodeo!!!

great sir really helpful  waiting for more videos like this

You are the best teacher I ever seen . You teach the future to us. The price of your video is infinite. Thanks from  Janatanagar,Chandkheda, Ahmedabad,gujrat, india.

me too :/

i found it, its a zip inside the zip download

Thank you so much for this infomattive course 🤩

Wow, that's absolutely awesome, I've looked for this tutorial for a long time, thank man, you're awesome

Amazing

I love it ❤️❤️❤️❤️😻😻

Great tutorial sir

Aksanından nasıl da belli... 😊

I used to work in a lab and we used to use Arduino and Arm controller with OpenCV and other ML libraries, one interesting project I could think of is Augmented Chess, we connected a huge led display to an ARM processor and two people stand in front of respective cameras and based on their hand movements the chess pieces in the display will move, the players can drag and place them, we did it for an exhibition (IMTEX) two years back.  Anyway, nice video.

Mind Blowing Course, thank you so much

Onde tem o curso

Thank you Murtaza for this fantastic tutorial, I can't find a way to download the cvzone library, do I have to buy the full course to get the library ?

Hello sir... Thanks for this video. Can you use C++ instead of python for this same video in an upcoming video? I'd really appreciate it...

Exellent Tutorial and explanation sir

AWESOME 😭😭😭

I find it frustrating that I can only click the "LIKE" button once. Great great great video!

wow 😊

I'm really interested to start this video!

Hello dear I like your videos.  But one questions how to know input and output sensors and also the output / input?

AttributeError: module 'serial' has no attribute 'Serial'

Ur tutorials are fabulous .. Thak u very much ...sir

Sir how to convert toy helicopter to fly autonomously ? Can u plz make that ? Sir ...

Interesting Project

Follow the link in the description and login to the website to download the library.

@murtazasworkshop  Thank you, I just had to enroll before to be able to download the files.

@murtazasworkshop  i found it, thanks!

I once had used C# with arduino serial. Its very cumbersome in protocol and sync.

@alexlo7708  I meant C++...

Thank you for your kind words

self.ser = serial.Serial(p.device)

File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cvzone/SerialModule.py", line 34, in _init_     self.ser = serial.Serial(p.device)

Please keep going on

I hv a question. 🙋🏼‍♀️ Does my Smart bulb hv Adrino inside it? . Can i bring it out ? 🤔

Awsm 🍫. I am gonna buy a Adrino now .. Thanks

Murtaza how are you man? This is Mohamad from AUM (RoboticChallenge 2018)....this course is amazing  I would work on it in my free time

OMG!!! thank you so much <3

Does serial module available in c++?

Love it.... <3  so informative.

That's  cool.

Wow I always wanted to see such a channel. AND IT IS FROM PAKISTAN MY COUNTRY . Luv U

This guy is insane...Great video course...You save me a lot

Really amazing course, i searched for.......

Sir thanks for the course , it was awesome  I am getting this error : WARNING:root:Serial Device Not Connected  Can any 1 help me

You are AMAZING

Amazing Course 😊

I love you man

There is some sound glitch intermittently, but overall content is perfect

This is perfect

thank you very much for this tutorial. my question is, can i use my custom yolo4 weights and cfg files to apply to arduino uno board

Does anyone have trouble with findFaces function? It says I'm missing the 'img' argument

Thank you so much!

@aryanpatel7778  see in his channel desciption he is Pakistani

Try using the COM number instead . e.g. arduino = SerialObject("COM3")

I tried that too, still it is not able to recognize the serial device .Note : I used vs code for programming python

Having the same issue here with pycharm

indeed

Thanks

@murtazasworkshop  Sir, does course have wireless communications with raspberry pi as well ?

​ @murtazasworkshop   Stop for a second and think how ridiculous it is the amount of clicks and button pushing one must do to turn On and Off an LED., not to mention the insane amount of knowledge required as the reason for each button push or a click. (In contrast, Usually it takes one flip of a switch for on and one for off)  The point is that the humans seem to be becoming more like machines instead of us making the machines more like humans.  (It is time for the Arduino and Raspberry Pi to become self-aware! ) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get it? .. or are you stuck in the belief that it is cool to know all that stuff just to flip a switch.

@reasonerenlightened2456  ok tony stark

@murtazasworkshop  Where can we get the CVzone library?

@manishdhakal9379  Enroll for their course in the link provided in description, then you'll see the option to download their zip file, extract that file and inside there you'll find another zip file that you need to add to Arduino IDE.

Keep up the great content :)

Buen video gracias 👍🏾

So does the full course simply use the Arduino as a slave as shown here or is there something more complex?

Cool

This course is amazing  But is there a way that this project can be done without computer is one of its components    I hope there is a way so this project can be set and be used without the need of pc  I dont know but is pixy2 can be used ?

Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI AWESOME DUDE  I'll go get the terminator)) T-X

https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMoSUbG1Q_r_wT0Ac7rOlhlwq9VsZDA0b  Sir in that project (line detection) you used Test video which is available the link but unfortunately it doesn't work  So I really need that video if you could send me in email or Instagram  Because I did few emails and Instagram messages about that video  So please send me Waiting for

Thank you sir .. It was very helpful sir .. Can you add a video related to Arduino and OpenCV without Python .. Please help.  I'm doing a new project for Virtual Exhibition these days .. Its main parts are Arduino OpenCV .. I hope so .. Thank you very much sir ..♥️♥️♥️

Great content

Great job, and course. It will help many people to understand programming

Literally No words to define my happiness after seeing the notification of this course thanks thanks thank you so much 🙂 😍😆

Wow , Thanks bro .......

Thanks a lot sir

Tks u so much

hello, Mr. Murtaza firstly i would like to say thank you so much for your amazing channel your amazing videos your big efforts really benefited me greatly i would like to ask if i can share your videos on my channel with Arabic translation by my voice not writing. my greeting

Amazing job, thx.

THANK YOU FOR THE CONTENT! Just one little request - less of fake drawing hand please. Although it adds some dynamic to mostly static slides, it also distracts from the slide's content and sometimes just outright annoying...

Finally  It happend. Thank you very much sir 🖤🤘🏽

So cool

Wow, awesome course

Forrest Milner  Indeed such a simple device does not have the processing capability.  This video sequence could therefore be just be reduced to the trivial topic of basic 'message passing' - which is all that it really is. Hardly worthy of the price of the course.

I thought he was going to implement and read data from a camera via UART I2C or SPI and process the image in the Arduino.

@_grumpyoldman  could recommend any other channel or video series on thia topic

@_grumpyoldman  am a beginner

Nice click bait! Putting arduino and vision together, combo buzz word for your video... I learned a lot, just from the title alone🤣

@_grumpyoldman  1111

​ @NextGenMechLife 😅😢😅😮😢

Pixy has limitations and is costly. Instead use raspberry pi with a picam.

Also posted bro ,just check the playlist

1

I am glad you found it useful.

@murtazasworkshop  I have also made that Project on my own which you have shown in the yt shorts controlling light brightness using hand gesture This is only because of u 😊😜

Paul

Aoa bro, Thanks for sharing such an Awesome video. Keep it up.
