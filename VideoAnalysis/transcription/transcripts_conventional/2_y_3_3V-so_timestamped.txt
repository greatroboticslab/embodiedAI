[00:00:00.560 → 00:00:05.000] If you connect the charged capacitor across an inductor, you will see a beautiful energy
[00:00:05.000 → 00:00:08.120] exchange take place between the two elements.
[00:00:08.120 → 00:00:13.180] These energy oscillations look as if the capacitor is saying, you take the energy, and the inductor
[00:00:13.180 → 00:00:16.500] then says, no, you take my energy.
[00:00:16.500 → 00:00:19.560] Why don't any of these elements store the energy and become settled?
[00:00:19.560 → 00:00:24.000] Let's have a look at the interesting physics behind these oscillations and some of the
[00:00:24.000 → 00:00:26.940] applications.
[00:00:26.940 → 00:00:32.300] Before diving into the LC circuit, we need to understand a simple circuit, a capacitor-resistor
[00:00:32.300 → 00:00:33.780] circuit.
[00:00:33.780 → 00:00:36.500] The capacitor is fully charged initially.
[00:00:36.500 → 00:00:39.120] Let's introduce a resistor into the circuit.
[00:00:39.120 → 00:00:44.120] Here you can observe that initially the current flow is at the maximum and then it sharply decays
[00:00:44.120 → 00:00:45.600] with time.
[00:00:45.600 → 00:00:50.020] This is expected because at the beginning the charge difference is at the maximum, so the
[00:00:50.020 → 00:00:54.020] current has to be at the maximum.
[00:00:54.020 → 00:00:58.340] Now let's see what will happen if the resistor is replaced with an inductor.
[00:00:58.340 → 00:01:01.800] Here again, the capacitor is fully charged initially.
[00:01:01.800 → 00:01:06.080] It's quite logical to expect that there will be a huge current flow at the beginning, and
[00:01:06.080 → 00:01:09.420] then the current flow would reduce as in the previous case.
[00:01:09.420 → 00:01:12.340] However, this will not happen in practice.
[00:01:12.340 → 00:01:17.400] An inductor develops EMF across it, based on the change in current flow.
[00:01:17.400 → 00:01:22.340] This means that a drastic change in current is not possible across the inductor as in the
[00:01:22.340 → 00:01:23.840] previous case.
[00:01:23.840 → 00:01:29.300] Now the current flow starts from zero and increases to the maximum, and then comes back to zero
[00:01:29.300 → 00:01:30.680] again.
[00:01:30.680 → 00:01:35.960] In an inductor capacitor circuit, the current flow variation has to be gradual, and here
[00:01:35.960 → 00:01:40.880] we can see that the current flow in the LC circuit is shaped like a sine curve.
[00:01:40.880 → 00:01:44.720] Let's look at the electron flow animation once again.
[00:01:44.720 → 00:01:53.200] The current in the circuit starts from zero and gradually achieves the maximum value.
[00:01:53.200 → 00:01:58.200] In the next one quarter of a time period, the current from the capacitor starts to decrease,
[00:01:58.200 → 00:02:00.740] resulting in another change in current.
[00:02:00.740 → 00:02:05.380] At the end of the capacitor discharge, if you check the EMF across the inductor, it will
[00:02:05.380 → 00:02:11.200] have the opposite polarity to the initial EMF.
[00:02:11.200 → 00:02:16.100] This reverse EMF charges the capacitor with the opposite polarity.
[00:02:16.100 → 00:02:22.660] In the next half of the time period, the capacitor will be fully charged with the reverse polarity.
[00:02:22.660 → 00:02:28.880] This also means that the current flow will be in the reverse direction for the next half.
[00:02:28.880 → 00:02:35.840] Hence, in an ideal circuit, this back and forth flow of current would continue to charge and
[00:02:35.840 → 00:02:41.200] discharge the capacitor and form endless oscillations of energy.
[00:02:41.200 → 00:02:49.180] However, practically, we can never achieve such ideal behavior due to the presence of resistance.
[00:02:49.180 → 00:02:52.800] The resistance causes energy decay in the form of heat.
[00:02:52.800 → 00:02:57.580] This means that in a practical circuit, the oscillations will die out eventually.
[00:02:57.580 → 00:03:02.980] As we increase the resistance, the oscillations die out very quickly as shown.
[00:03:02.980 → 00:03:08.060] If we increase the resistance further to some critical value, there would be no oscillation
[00:03:08.060 → 00:03:09.940] at all.
[00:03:09.940 → 00:03:17.200] Underdamped LC circuits have many applications in industry, namely thyristors, magnetrons, etc.
[00:03:17.200 → 00:03:22.200] In communication systems, they are an integral part of frequency filters.
