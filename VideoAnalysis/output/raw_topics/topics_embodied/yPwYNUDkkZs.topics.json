And if you replace this line with a shape like Z, first letter of Zener,\nit becomes a Zener diode schematic symbol. And if you surround the diode symbol with a circle,\nit becomes an LED symbol. This component will allow current to flow in this direction from its\nanode to its cathode and it will block current in opposite direction. If you put voltage to diode in\nright order, I mean positive voltage to anode pin and negative voltage to cathode pin, then your diode",

All of these parameters are available in data sheet.\nIn data sheet of every diode, it is available to check how much voltage the diode will tolerant in reverse\nby a setup. For example, if you are going to rectify AC power in United States by a half wave rectifier,\nyou can use these, but you can't use these because of shortage of reverse blocking voltage.\nContrary to what most newbies think, application of diodes is not limited to rectification.\nSecond application of diodes is my favorite. Application number two.\nUsing diode for reverse polarity protection to protect or product from inverted polarity.\nThink about your product. The result of all those efforts can be lost with just a small mistake.\nIf the user connects power supply in wrong polarity, main parts of your circuit will blow up.",
