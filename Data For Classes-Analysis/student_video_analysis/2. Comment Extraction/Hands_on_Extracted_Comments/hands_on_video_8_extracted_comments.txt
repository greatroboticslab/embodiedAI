bro tumne jo required components name show karne keliye text animation use kiya hoo kaise kiya

Looking at the robot it seems like the first thing to catch fire will be the robot itself😂😂

Lol😂

What is the counterfeit if i dont have L293 motor driver? I only have L293d motor driver

Where can i buy L293 motor driver? Badly need right now

Total cost kiti yeti

Bro, you should recive the call.

What is the A1, A2, B1, B2 port of motor driver for?

Thank you for the explanation, but the code does not work for me. Please give me the correct code

@hobby project please can i contact you regarding this project

Better use muti directional wheels. Then the moment will be a bit fast .

use L298 driver.

please Sir answer me 🙏

Or Full code 🙏

check the connections, code is fine.

I checked it very carefully

If you have another way to communicate, I will be very happy to contact you so that I can inform you of all the details

What is the app in mobile

Excuse me quick question, can I power the motor and the sim 800L with a battery of 9V?

I have problem the wheel is not move which typw of fault is there

Sir pin diagram send karo plz

Sir plz what changes can I do I will work with L298N L293MD is not available

Where did you order the L293 motor driver?

@Kiraraa-rb5if  I bought it In the nearby science project shop.

sure

update please, i have the same prob. l293 isnt available also in my country is it okay to use l293d?

Use L298N

use L298.

​ @hobbyproject9557 sir is the code and wire placement same for it? Or are there some Changes

@R0R0N0A_Z0R0  i have completed according to the circuit given in the description but it's not working after on it starts shooting the water not detecting fire neither gas

@RohitKumar-zi8fv  did you tried running the code given by him

@R0R0N0A_Z0R0  yes the same code given in the description

@RohitKumar-zi8fv  then may be the sensors have some defect.

@rohanbhagat83  provide your contact number bro need your helping

Can you give the program

Check the description

But the code was not working plz tell me another solution

download the code & open using IDE software or change its format from .ino to .text

yes same with me

bro i figured out .he didnt told that the relay module is of 15 v not 5 v he is using black colour relay module after searching for hours i figured out that he is using 15 v not 5 v thats  why our relay is malfunctioning

Hey bro, code in description work's perfectly fine.

@hobbyproject9557  hiii bro  Everything is working but not stopping at specific distance .. It keep going towords the fire  Pls help bro..🙏🏻

@rohanbhagat83  can u please help me i want it to detect fire and then shoot the water

Bro set the distance at 1meter

same problem bro

Sir, can you please tell me what kind of water pump and nozzle did you used? Thank you!

cost of all these

Hello, I need help with this project

cool❤️

Please give motor driver buy  link I can't find anywhere

Program link pls

Sir in servo motor drive where you connect that wires (you did not show in this video please tell😢😢😢

I downloaded the code from google drive, but can't open the file. Help pls

Great work Sir 💗💗

Bro coding can't install

This is a great project!! Well done.. But what is the use of relay in this ? Can you please elaborate it ?

bro ur insta id

nice work  but pls I wanna know the Arduino was it programmed by u or it was an already programed one that u use.? ?  am asking because a Friend told me to use an Arduino for project it must be programmed

By the way thank you. Aapke fire fighting robot using Arduino mene apne final year engineering projects me banaya tha aur aapse what's app pe contact bhi kiya tha. Aapki madad se project to ban gaya tha. aur mera engineering pura hua Once again thank you.

Ye to fire ke upper hi Chadh jata hai

Yahi to problem hoti hai Ye robot aag ki taraf bhaga jata hai Par ek specific distence pe rukta  kyun nai hai.

Oru lighter oke medikam puthiyathu😁🤣

Pls share email id..

🥱

👍

5v Mini water pumb and for nozzle i have used pen tip.

@hobbyproject9557   Hello sir,  Thank you so much for the information and have a lovely week ahead :)

@Kiran-bl1bs  Hi Kiran. I am so sorry to say this but I haven't yet get up to the coding bit (I need the PCB/ other structural system to do the code thing but I haven't yet receive the PCB). Are you also a first year uni student?

@hobbyproject9557  sir can you tell me is it remote controlled or automatic

automatic

@hobbyproject9557  sir i am making this project but i could not find buck converter. Can i make the same project without buck converter?

​ @santi9054 please give me code

@popcorn6044  buck converter is used to give accurate volt to the sim800l and adjust the volt in that

Hey, check the description

Hey, follow the circuit diagram.

Open it using Arduino ide  softwere, or change it's format to .text

for turning the water pump on

Yes

First u need to download the code from the link in description, and paste it in arduino ide softwere ,then include librarys (servo.h and softwereserial) then click the compile, select the port and just click the upload .

​ @jishnu3301 please give code given link in expired and not working

download using chrome.

@hobbyproject9557  still file not supported showing

open using ide software or change its format from .ino to .text

@hobbyproject9557  please paste code here

@hobbyproject9557  sir code is not working can you make one video on this code for fire fighting robot

Bro I need report of your code please

@ashutoshmishra1925  bhai mene project ka sara data delet mar diya. ab kuch nahi hai mere pass.jaha tak mujhe yaad hai, mene is video ke niche jo link hai wohi code istemaal kiya tha.koi change nahi kiya tha

@ashutoshmishra1925  bro i delet all the data. but mene code me koi bhi change nahi kiya tha.

Theek bhai shukriya

Bro if ur project is working then can u please help me

Vellom veenathanu bhaii.

9400496834 what's app.

Kudos 👌 ❤️❤️

🚌🍾🕺🤣

Show motor driver ..and make it using l298n or share your motor driver circuit diagram or link to buy your motor driver

Great work 👌🏻

Cashu Koduthu oru Puthiya Lighter Medikkadaa 😂

🤣

Ormagal odi kalikyunna...............

Bhaiii

@jishnu3301  🔥❤️🔥

Same connection for L298 driver.

@hobbyproject9557  hey  How many battery are good for better power  3 or 4 quantity..

@hobbyproject9557  what changes can do to increased water flow

3 battery is enough.

@hobbyproject9557  ok thanks

@rohanbhagat83   I think the size of the hose, the smaller the hose the more pressurized the water will be

@hobbyproject9557  Arduino UNO ko re-program ker sakte he ky ?...

Yes, when you upload a program it overwrites any previous program.

@hobbyproject9557  Ok Thanks 😇
