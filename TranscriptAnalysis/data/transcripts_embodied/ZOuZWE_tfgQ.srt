00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The LM386 is a really cool little IC. It's the heart of a lot of little audio amplifiers.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And it's amazing because all you need is a couple of capacitors and a resistor, a speaker, and some power.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And you're all set to make a really nice sounding audio amplifier.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And in this tutorial I'm going to show you first of all how to build a really basic amplifier with the minimal parts, one resistor and two capacitors.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now I'm going to show you how to make a better sounding amplifier.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And that's going to take some more capacitors but it's pretty easy.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And we're also going to add a bass boost control. So follow along and we'll get going here.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I've got the LM386 inserted into my breadboard with pin 1 in the upper left hand corner.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now I'm going to bridge the power rails. So connect the positive rails on both sides and the negative rails on both sides.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now take a jumper wire from pin 2 of the LM386 and connect it to ground.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now insert a 10K potentiometer somewhere into the breadboard.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And connect the jumper wire from the middle pin of the potentiometer up to pin 3 of the LM386.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now connect pin 4 to ground.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And one side of the potentiometer. Connect that to ground.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now we're going to put a 10 ohm resistor from pin 5 of the LM386. Bring that to another rail in the breadboard.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And you want to put a 0.1 microfarad capacitor from that resistor into the positive rail.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And then take the positive terminal of a 1000 microfarad electrolytic capacitor and insert it in between the resistor and the capacitor.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Now you want to take the positive wire from your speaker and connect it to the negative terminal of that electrolytic capacitor.

19
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And then take the negative line of your speaker and connect it anywhere into the ground rail.

20
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Now we have to connect pin 6 of the LM386 to the positive rail.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Alright now we're ready to connect the input for the amplifier circuit.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've cut into an old pair of headphones from my iPhone to use the 3.5mm audio jack.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And I have another blog post about this on the website. Just look for it under the circuit section.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So you want to connect the left or right audio channel into the third pin of the 10K potentiometer.

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And then the ground of the headphones into the ground rail of the circuit.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And you can check my blog post on this tutorial. It'll have a better diagram.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a lot easier to see what to do there.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So now I'm going to connect this up to my iPhone.

29
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Play this little song I mixed up a while ago.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And there's our volume control.

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And you can see it sounds pretty quiet.

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We don't have pin 1 or pin 8 bridged together in the circuit.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So the gain with this setup is only 20.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now if we want to make it a little louder we can connect a wire between pin 1 and pin 8.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And that'll make the gain 200.

36
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now you can see it's a lot louder. It's a little too loud. It's got some distortion.

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There it is.

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That'll be a little bit more thousand.

39
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There you are.

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There use a hundred pounds.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Do that many of the spots.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Please take the zoom on.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes.

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not scrolling on.

45
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now I'm scrolling on.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,500
Oh damn, raise your hand.

47
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm literally flying off the Trim.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But there's mostly aint fres se.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And I think more nails.

50
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
However, fits the most of thekalif x type.

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:19,840
Alright, well that does it for the really basic audio amplifier.

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,600
Let's try making one that sounds a lot better.

53
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
So I'm starting out with an empty breadboard here.

54
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,000
I just have the power, the 9-volt battery, connected up to one side of the breadboard.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,880
So I'm going to bridge the two power rails and connect positive to positive and negative

56
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,880
to negative.

57
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:53,760
Now I'm going to insert the LM386 in there.

58
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,160
I've got pin 1 in the upper left hand side.

59
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:06,240
Now you want to connect pin 1 down to another rail somewhere in the breadboard.

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,680
We're going to add our gain potentiometer to this.

61
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:15,840
You want to connect that to the middle pin of the potentiometer.

62
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,280
This is a 10K potentiometer.

63
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:30,200
Now connect pin 2 of the LM386 to ground.

64
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:38,580
Pin 3 goes to another rail in the breadboard.

65
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:47,040
We're going to want to put a 740 pF capacitor from that rail into ground.

66
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,660
This is a decoupling capacitor.

67
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,540
You can read more about that on the blog post.

68
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:58,760
Now you want to take that same rail and then bring it down to another rail on the breadboard.

69
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,920
This is where our volume control is going to go.

70
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,440
This is another 10K potentiometer.

71
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,640
So connect that to the middle pin of the potentiometer.

72
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:18,920
And then take one of the outside pins of the potentiometer and wire it to ground.

73
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:25,780
Now completing our gain control, we want to insert a 10uF electrolytic capacitor from pin

74
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,440
8 of the LM386 up to another rail.

75
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,380
And the negative side of the capacitor goes to the pin of the LM386.

76
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,440
The positive side goes up to the other rail.

77
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:47,620
Now take another jumper wire from that rail and connect it to one of the outside pins of

78
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,520
your gain potentiometer.

79
00:07:50,520 --> 00:08:01,680
So now you want to insert a 10k ohm resistor from pin 7 of LM386 and bring that down to

80
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,480
another rail of the breadboard.

81
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:11,060
Now we want to insert another capacitor from the end of that resistor into ground with the

82
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,340
negative side of the capacitor going to the ground side.

83
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,680
The positive side going to the resistor side.

84
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:29,740
Now we need to wire pin 6 of the LM386 to the positive rail.

85
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:40,880
And then we need to insert a 0.1uF capacitor between pin 4 and pin 6.

86
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,260
Kind of hard to get in here.

87
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:48,160
With all these capacitors and wires it's best to get them as close to the chip as possible

88
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,300
to minimize noise and interference from radios and other stuff.

89
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,220
Now insert a jumper from pin 5 down to another rail of the breadboard.

90
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:14,280
And then from there insert a 10 ohm resistor.

91
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:27,220
Now insert a 0.1uF capacitor at the end of that resistor into ground.

92
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,600
Now take a 1000uF capacitor and insert the positive side into that rail with the resistor and the

93
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
other capacitor.

94
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,280
And the negative side into another rail.

95
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,040
Now we're going to add some decoupling capacitors for the power supply.

96
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:51,600
So insert a 0.1uF capacitor between the positive and negative power rails.

97
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,100
And then insert another capacitor.

98
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:59,600
This one's 100uF in between the positive and negative power rails.

99
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,180
And make sure the polarity is correct for these capacitors.

100
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,320
I had a tantalum capacitor explode on me the other day.

101
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,320
That was not fun.

102
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
I might make another video about that.

103
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,480
I actually inserted it backwards and the thing blew up between my fingers and I got burned

104
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
kind of bad.

105
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,580
So try to avoid that if possible.

106
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,180
Now we want to insert a jumper wire from pin 4 into ground.

107
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:33,320
Now we're ready to connect our speakers.

108
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:41,180
So grab the positive wire of your speaker and insert it into that negative side of your

109
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,580
1000uF capacitor.

110
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:53,420
And then take the negative wire and insert that anywhere into the ground rail.

111
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,980
Now that we have that we're ready for the input.

112
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,080
Now take either the left or right channel and wire it up to the remaining pin of your

113
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,840
volume potentiometer.

114
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:23,120
And then take the ground wire and connect it anywhere into the ground rail.

115
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,680
Now we're ready to test it out.

116
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:41,960
So I'll connect up my iPhone.

117
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,900
And you can hear it's got a lot better sound than that first circuit we built.

118
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,960
Plus we have a gain control and a volume control.

119
00:11:48,960 --> 00:12:03,960
I still have some distortion but we can balance it out with the gain and the volume.

120
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,960
So I'll connect it to the bottom rail.

121
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Now let's add some bass control.

122
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:30,960
I have another little mini breadboard over here with a 10k potentiometer inserted.

123
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:39,960
So you want to connect a jumper wire from pin 1 of the LM386 up to an outer pin of the potentiometer.

124
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:46,960
Now take the middle pin of the potentiometer and bring it down to another rail of the breadboard.

125
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,960
And insert a 0.033 microfarad capacitor from the end of that connection down to another rail

126
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
of the breadboard.

127
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:05,960
And then connect the other end of that capacitor over to pin 5 of the LM386.

128
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:17,960
So I'll connect the other end of that capacitor.

129
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,960
And then connect the other end of that capacitor.

130
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,960
So I'll connect the other end of that capacitor.

131
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:37,960
So I'll connect the other end of that capacitor.

132
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,960
So I will connect the other end of that capacitor.

133
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,960
So I'll connect the other end of that capacitor.

134
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
Really?

135
00:13:48,960 --> 00:14:18,940
Thank you.

136
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:48,940
Thank you.

137
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Thank you.

138
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:48,940
Thank you.

139
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,020
Well, that's about it.

140
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,620
I hope you enjoyed that.

141
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,800
Don't forget to subscribe to keep updated on more videos coming out soon.

142
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,900
Definitely going to be doing some more of these audio circuits.

143
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:03,500
Might try a distortion, maybe like a tube amplifier sometime in the future.

144
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,900
So keep updated with that.

145
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,020
And have a good day.

146
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,320
Bye-bye.

147
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:18,680
Bye-bye.

148
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,760
Bye-bye.
