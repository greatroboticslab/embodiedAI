00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,440
If you have ever worked with electronics, you've likely heard about decoupling capacitors.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,800
But do you know why they are so important? In this video,

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,480
we will delve into them and their significance in electronics design.

4
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,920
In electronics, different parts of a circuit can create noise or electrical disturbances

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,760
that can affect the performance of other parts of the circuits. This noise can be caused by various

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,080
factors such as switching of transistors, voltage spikes, electromagnetic interference, and so on.

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,360
The coupling capacitors are used to suppress this noise by providing a low impedance path to ground

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:53,120
for high frequency noise. These are two circuits to demonstrate the presence of noise. First,

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,320
an LM7805 voltage regulator which receives the voltage and stabilizes it to 5V DC.

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,520
And with this 555 timer, generating an square wave at 123Hz, which is considered low frequency.

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,040
For the input of the regulator, I am using a switching mode power supply adjusted at 9V DC.

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,040
By looking into the output with the multimeter, everything appears normal, with an average output of 5V.

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,400
If we look with the oscilloscope, indeed it appears around 5V. Good.

14
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:41,360
But if we look close there, the line looks fuzzy. This is electrical noise, mainly generated by the power

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,640
supply, but also by the regulator itself, internally switching at high speed trying to stabilize the output voltage.

16
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,680
This noise includes a ripple, seen as a high frequency AC component superimposed on the DC signal,

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,360
which can cause problems in certain applications, in this case more than 900 mV.

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,120
If we add some load at the output, let's say this LED with a resistance, guess what happens?

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,000
Ouch! The regulator gets more stressed due to the load, and the output noise goes even higher,

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,720
almost 2V peak to peak. This noise is also getting back to the power rail of the circuit.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,640
I am enabling the second channel of the scope to see both signals. See the blue line, how the noise

22
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,440
increases as I connect the LED, which means that other components on the same circuit will be affected

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:50,560
as well. The datasheet recommends adding one capacitor of 0.22uF at the input, and an optional one at the output.

24
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,600
The first is the decoupling capacitor because it decouples or isolates this component from the rest,

25
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:09,360
in this case from the power supply. I will use this film capacitor of 0.33uF, which is the closest one that I have.

26
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:20,240
Oh, perfect! The new readings of the peak to peak noise is around 150mV. We have an improvement here.

27
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,880
Great! Now let's analyze the 5F5 timer. The signal looks like a classic square wave,

28
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,280
but if we zoom in we see this spike on the left, and lots of noise with it. For this circuit the input

29
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:47,680
is 9V, the peak is more than 6V, that's 54%. Hmm, for reference it is too much.

30
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,760
I am adding two capacitors at the power lines of the integrated circuit to see the effect.

31
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,160
Why too? And how did I know the values of each of them? Well, because they are prescribed in the

32
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:10,800
datasheet of the manufacturer. The final square wave looks much cleaner. The readings this time for the

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,560
noise amplitude is only 400mV. Compared with the previous one, it is way lower. Perfect!

34
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,440
What if we connect the output of the regulator to power the 5F5 timer?

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:30,800
We do this by connecting the ground line and then the output of the regulator, this pin 3,

36
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,840
to the power line of the 5F5 timer. That means that we are accumulating the power supply,

37
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:46,080
the regulator and the 5F5 timer in series. And actually this is a common array for many circuits.

38
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,280
The shape of the square wave reflects the accumulated noise from the power source

39
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,680
and from the regulator. So imagine having this kind of behavior in more complex circuits.

40
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,320
This is a ripple and noise. Notice this tilted section of the wave. That is not right. We can measure

41
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:17,680
more than 900mV. This is 20% of 5V. Now let's go ahead to add the decoupling capacitor to the input of the regulator.

42
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:33,040
Now we have like 500mV of peak to peak noise. Things are getting better. That's good.

43
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Now adding the first of the two decoupling capacitors of the 5F5 timer.

44
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,400
First with 0.1uF5 timer. First with 0.1uF5 timer. Or 104 code for a ceramic capacitor.

45
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,760
Which should remove higher frequencies. This gives like 140mV for the noise.

46
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,160
Now adding the electrolytic capacitor of 1uF5 timer. This one should remove the lower frequencies from the

47
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:13,920
noise. Hmm. This one is only helping to fix the left side of the shape. But not for reducing the overall noise.

48
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,720
Anyway we leave it as it is prescribed by the datasheet. Our final signal is squared and flat at the bottom

49
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,880
and at the top. And not that thick. And the final noise gives 140mV equivalent to 2.8%.

50
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:39,440
That's a more acceptable value. Not bad. But what if we need a cleaner output signal?

51
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,840
First, let's remember that a breadboard is not the best way to measure and eliminate electrical noise.

52
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,560
However, there are several techniques that can be used. But those depend on condition of circuit.

53
00:06:52,560 --> 00:07:02,160
That includes frequency, amplitude, power, peak amplitude, external interference, radio frequencies,

54
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,000
nominal voltage, tolerances, cost, and many others. But those are not covered in this video.

55
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,160
Ok, now we have a practical idea of why decoupling capacitors are so important.

56
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,320
I hope you liked this video.

57
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,120
Knock knock.

58
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:25,760
That's f...

59
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
That's 50...

60
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,840
That's good.

61
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
Good.

62
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,240
Good.

63
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Milliballs per...

64
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
But what...

65
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,760
But what if...

66
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:53,360
What if...

67
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,600
So that partir.

68
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,760
This is not a little too much about d lij

69
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
bad mão.

70
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,760
So that this is still a little too much about all of the miroczyños.

71
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,180
That permitir.

72
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,560
And it can be Mauricio.
