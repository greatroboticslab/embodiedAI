Please make a series on robot framework with pycharm. Your this series is quite old and in this 5 years many new changes are available in robotframwork.

Thank you~!

@Raghav Awesome Step by Step guide to Automation testing. Now we have latest Roboframework which is slightly different from the tool you used during this presentation.

Hi Raghav, may i know, Ride Robot does able to install on mac os catalina?

Can I practice in vs studio code

My ride is opening in VS studio cod what should I do

Hi, i have installed selenium library via cmd prompt but getting red color  after I import in new project .could you please suggest me

Hi. Thank you very much for this step by step tutorial. Can you suggest me as to why I cannot see or access OpenBrowser command in Robot (9.39). Thank you.

really useful to learn, thank you

How to fix this ? Could you please help? @Automation Step by Step SessionNotCreatedException: Message: session not created: This version of ChromeDriver only supports Chrome version 96 Current browser version is 98.0.4758.82 with binary path C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe

tried using the text format for the testsuite encountered error change format to robot works fine with me

Thanks a lot from France, we have just started automatisation, and this helps me a lot.

Simple and very neatly explained 👌

my ride did not have an open browser.My I know on how to solve this issue ?

can you make a video on how to handle cookies using a robot framework? ex: on a login page, a pop-up is opened asking to accept cookies, just one button accept cookies and should close the pop-up.If I accept the cookie manually the tests work otherwise it fails even after using different cookie keywords of selenium library.

ctrl+tab do not give me suggestions

Thanks. You teach people in the simplest but a solid way!

Hi, Thanks for this series. Could you Please make a series like this with pycharm also?

Thank you so much for this great video! But I have an issue, I cannot find the OpenBrowser or SeleniumLibrary.Open Browser keyword in the selenium library. When i press CTRL+ Space many keywords appear but not that one. Can you please help me on this.

Sankar will need more details, what extension in specific and what exactly you need it for

I will plan Priya

@RaghavPal  Thank you for replying almost every individual message. Thank you on behalf of all of us. Love your videos.

Most welcome

I will check and plan to add new videos Samuel

Hi Fawzi, there were some issues when I tried it at the time of creating these tutorials, https://youtu.be/Z8PxYNCBmIQ there may have been some changes, you will need to check

Yes you can, The UI will be different, you can follow the scripts and execution

Hi Akshay, have you installed and opened RIDE as shown in the video. Pls check and try again

Hi Nandu,  try to clean and check the path of the files inside the Python_Version folder There are some troubleshoots, you should try. 1. There is a "Import Failed Help" button on the right, below the "Variables" button. 2. As instructed in the help, you should see Tools>View RIDE Log. 3. You may right click over the failed to import library and "Import Library Spec XML"  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40212315/robotframework-ride-sikulilibrary-import-error

will need to check your setup and logs

@RaghavPal  Thank you for the quick reply. Actually I figured the issue. SeleniumLibrary does not have "Open Browser" keyword but Selenium2Library has it.

Thanks

I have fixed it. :)

Great to know Tanusri

ok

Great to know, can find more of my work here - https://automationstepbystep.com/

Thanks for watching Manvvi

May be some library issue, try to get install library again, can try a diff ver

Hi, I will check on this

Try restarting Robot framework IDE

Most welcome Cagri

Hi Induja, can check here - https://automationstepbystep.com/

very good job, continue ;)

After clicking ctrl+space open browser not appearing , selenium library version and robot or python version conflict occurring

If you find issue with "Open Browser" keyword is not seen on ride then - use "pip uninstall" to uninstall all the selenium library - install "pip install robotframework-selenium2library==1.8.0" then import library "selenium2library"

Are Robot framework and RPA same? I'm new to these kind of stuff..

Hi raghav i need to automate API using robot framework have you created any such video

Tks one more time, for another amazing tutorial Raghav. I have a question. I have installed: Python 2.7, RF 3.2.2. I don't see the OpenBrowser keyword, but I see GO TO. So I tried   SeleniumLibrary.Go To    www.google.com, but I got: No browser is open. If I use  SeleniumLibrary.Go To    www.google.com    chrome I got Keyword 'SeleniumLibrary.Go To' expected 1 argument, got 2.

what if i get error like "robot installation" not found? is the error because i installed in c:user :appdata?

Hi Raghav this was very helpful I have installed EyesLibrary and the same is present in site packages folder. But when I try to import them in RIDE I am unable to do them as it is displayed in Red color. How can we fix this issue?

Thank you so much for this great video! It's been really helpful! But I have an issue, I cannot find the OpenBrowser or SeleniumLibrary.Open Browser keyword in the selenium library. When i press CTRL+ Space many keywords appear but not that one.

What if we don't have "OpenBrowser"? I Only have CloseBroswer.

i am getting error bro when i am installing of ride.py

Ctrl + Space does not work anymore, for the latest verstion is ctrl-alt-space. That works.

Very nice!   But I guess Ctrl + Space does not work anymore....

Good stuff, thanks for these series..

I cannot add Test suite, cause it is not available in my RIDE, anyone can help? Thanks

For me Ctrl+space is not working, instead ctrl+Alt+space is working

I followed the same steps in creating the project and testsuite and test case, while executing it asked if its a robot file or text file it was by mistake clicked as robot. But I could not change it to say text as that option is not shown again even after unintall and install. Due to this unable to execute the test case as convertion of robot file to text is not possible and stuck. Can you suggest please

WONDERFUL

Hi Raghav, good tutorial, can you explain why i can not see in settings table with grid, just see a little button settings in test case, but nothing load below with rows 1,2,3... Use Python 3.8, and robotframework 3.1.2,RIDE version 1.7.3.1

Very nicely explained

Thanks a lot Youssef

Try to reopen ride

Thanks for the help Malay

No Vanathi, these are different

Hi Nitin, not specific for API, I will do in future, You will find all tutorials here - https://automationstepbystep.com/

Hi, I will need to check on SeleniumLibrary.Go, meanwhile pls take some online help and check some examples

Hi Amiya, this may be due to the env variables (path) not set. Pls check this - https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/INSTALL.rst Here goto the section What directories to add to PATH Let me know if this works

@RaghavPal  it was defined in the env variable....probably the issue was with a pybot file...it is resolved...Thankyou very much for reverting back...by any chance can we automate for mainframe? any specific library that will help for mainframe design?

Not done any automation on mainframe yet

how can we use keyword that we have created in one project to another project? e.g keyword is "login details" , we have used this keywors in 20 test cases under project1....so how to use for rest 20 test cases which are in project2?...it seems like we have to create keyword again for project2

Hi Nayeem, how have you installed it.

@RaghavPal  Hi Ragav, I had installed it by using pip command pip install robotframework-eyeslibrary

Just check if you have 2 versions of python installed on your system

@RaghavPal  Hi Raghav, there is only one python version installed in my system and now the issue got resolved don't know the exact solution how it got resolved..

GReat, keep learning

Hi Sam, Can try a diff ver of the lib

Hi Lana, why is that Open Browser should be in the library. Can try to reinstall the selenium library

@RaghavPal  I don't know, i restarted all of the programs, and reinstalled seleniumlibrary, and it was still missing a lot of the keywords. Then i deleted mine, and a colleague sent me his (just copy paste haha), and now it works 🤷‍♀️ thank you for the sessions, they are really helpful.

Pls inform error details /logs

thanks for adding Jean

Thank you! Very good class!

Hi Jean, Ctrl+Alt+Space will work

Thank you! Very good class!

You're welcome Julius

Hi Tieu, on cmd run command pip check robotframework and see if you get any warnings. If yes you may check to fix or reinstall a newer ver.

Okay. should be fine. Hope others will be helped by this

Hi, I may not remember exactly. Can you point to the time in the video so I can refer and check

Thanks for watching

Hi Nenad, I hope you have used the right ver of wxPython. Try restarting as well

Thanks for watching Prachi

@RaghavPal can u advise if a commence  Background person can learn automation and please advise a good website from where to start

Hi Prachi, definitely you can learn test automation. Start with some basics. First decide on a topic like Selenium with Java and then follow the tutorials, You will find a lot of options and resources online. Can refer my website here -  https://automationstepbystep.com/online-courses/

when i say ride.py from command prompt it is opening pycharm and ride.py as a project

Excellent tutorial. Thank you!

If ride open pycharm instead of RobotFramework, it's because pycharm "open by default" leads. Right click on ride.py > Open with > Select other applications > C:\your_path_to\python.exe

Hi Raghav,   This is regarding Robot Framework. I am went through your tutorial using Robot framework and Selenium Library. and it is really wonderful.  My concern is I am working with Robot Framework with White Library for Windows applications, WPF mainly and not getting any help in internet.  I am able to automate tests using RIDE as it is supporting Python 3 as well but I want to integrate it to any other IDE like Visual Studio.  If you can make some tutorials regarding the same, then it would be really helpful as no one has made any project on this yet.  Thanks in advance, Sahasransu  Sahu

Hi Sir, Can you make a tutorial for Robot framework with white library for WPF or desktop applications. This would be really helpful.

i m using python 3.6.5 version. Is ride available for python 3.6.5 version?

This was really very very helpful. I was struggling to understand RobotFramework for quite sometime and this helped to understand step by step.

Great. Thanks for sharing.  In step6 if anyone facing problem to all keywords of selenium library, hit ctrl+Alt+space. (I am using RIDE 1.7.3.1 running on Python 2.7.13.)

Hi Raghav, Thanks a lot for this video. It has been very helpful. Can you please suggest why we need to add SeleniumLibrary at suite level when we have already added at project level. In my current project there is a huge hierarchy, do we need to add selenium library at each and every level.

I want to use robot framework for desktop applications and not web applications. How do I begin?  Nicely explained, by the way!

Hi, I am not able to see autosuggestion keywords in RIDE. Do have any idea why  I am not able to see that ?

when i try to open ride it not opened.give like this:  Traceback (most recent call last):    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\__init__.py", line 83, in main      _run(inpath, not noupdatecheck, debug_console)    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\__init__.py", line 102, in _run      from robotide.application import RIDE    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\application\__init__.py", line 16, in <module>      from .application import RIDE, Project    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\application\@t", line 22, in <module>      from robotide.namespace import Namespace    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\namespace\__init__.py", line 16, in <module>      from .namespace import Namespace    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\namespace\@t", line 31, in <module>      from robotide.publish import PUBLISHER, RideSettingsChanged, RideLogMessage    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\publish\__init__.py", line 123, in <module>      from .messages import *    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\publish\@t", line 21, in <module>      from .messages2 import *    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\publish\@t", line 24, in <module>      from robotide.publish import publisher    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\publish\@t", line 24, in <module>      from pubsub import pub    File "C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\pubsub\@t", line 146      def getDefaultPublisher() -> Publisher:                                ^  SyntaxError: invalid syntax    plzzzz solve

Ctr + Space can't see the available function ,why? How can I fix the issue?

hi do you have example of robot framework usage on desktop applications?

Hi Raghav, Thanks for your detailed videos. Have a question, can we run robot framework selenium tests using Selenium GRID? instead of local web driver like chrome for parallel execution?

Anyone interested in automation tester position in Virginia? I am looking to hire someone experienced in using Selenium with Python and Robot Framework. Send your profile to resumes@patsonusa.com

how to resolve the  issue when selenium library appear in red color instead black after import?

I'm facing this issue with ride. when ever i click on run a window appears and say robotframework is not found. i checked the robot framework installation and environment variables but the problem is persistent

Thank you Raghav Pal for this Tutorial, i have this problem when i run the test case: please can you help me ? command: pybot.bat --argumentfile c:\users\rsassi\appdata\local\temp\RIDEbw_rqs.d\argfile.txt --listener C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\contrib\testrunner\TestRunnerAgent.py:51764:False D:\projets\Ride

YOU MUST have pybot even though it is "deprecated". If not, tests will fail. If you don't have pybot, go to the Scripts directory, create a new file named pybot.bat. Inside that file enter this:  @echo off python -m robot.run %*  Save the file and try running the tests.

I figured out how to open using python, thanks..

glad to know Raju

You're welcome Brian

Nice to share this information. I hope there is no issues you are facing.

Thanks Raghav. I'm learning, so, I will face other problems but your courses are great and should be enough. Thanks for sharing your knowledge ;-)

Hi Usman, what exactly is the error message. May be if you google it you can get some suggestions. Also check this command pip check robotframework pip check robotframework-ride

This is because the robotframework version. Uninstall robotframework 3.1.1 then install robotframework 3.0: pip install robotframework ==3.0

Hi Raghav, I am trying to install the Selenium Library but i am getting the exception in the cmd prompt   An HTTPS request has been made, but the SNI (Server Name Indication) extension to TLS is not available on this platform. This may cause the server to present an incorrect TLS certificate, which can cause validation failures. You can upgrade to a newer version of Python to solve this.

Excellent and thorough. Thanks!

Hi Appan, try running this command pip check robotframework This will show you if there are any missing dependecies

I tried sir but that doesn't help. There's no such missing dependencies.

Did you check with the video. Just in case you missed any step

I checked again sir. I uninstalled everything and again tried from the scratch but I'm unable to execute the test due to the following error - [command: pybot.bat --argumentfile c:\users\appan\appdata\local\temp\RIDE3vx03t.d\argfile.txt --listener C:\Python27\lib\site-packages\robotide\contrib\testrunner\TestRunnerAgent.py:49613:False "E:\Softwares\My PC Apps\Robot Framework\RIDE\Projects\Project1\Project1" [Error 2] The system cannot find the file specified]  One thing I should say, [pybot --version] is not recognized in cmd prompt.

Hi Annu, Ideally you should be able to use any version. It depends on the compatibility of chrome with selenium ver - for any version you can check with this link - https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.36/notes.txt In the above link in place of 2.36 you can put your chrome driver ver and check

Hi Asher, pls let me know what you have already tried.

Hi Bahjat, try changing the version of browser driver

Thanks Raghav, i ended up using Firefox instead

Try restarting RIDE

Great to know this Ashok

Hi Arun, glad to know this. I will check and try to do it soon

Hi Monika, so if you have used Katalon, how did you find it, Were you able to accomplish all planned tasks.

Automation Step by Step - Raghav Pal yes katalon is more powerful than Robot framework. Installation is quite easy and we create a batch file which can be executed on anyone's m/c by just keeping katalon extraxt. So I consider it amazing framework and development and execution time is less than other frameworks

Great, then go with it, Just for knowledge pls share some info about your project that you automated with Katalon Studio. What all features did you add. I want to look at successful stories of the use of Katalon Studio in enterprise projects

Thanks, very detailed and educational!

Hi Raghav, i am facing 'Keyword not found!!' issue. please help me. below is the issue summary,  Keyword not found!!For possible corrections press <ctrl> ---------------------------------------------- On pressing <ctrl>, got the below output  Keyword was not detected by RIDE  Possible corrections:  Import library or resource file containing the keyword.   For library import errors: Consider importing library spec XML (Tools / Import Library Spec XML or by adding the XML file with the correct name to PYTHONPATH) to enable keyword completion for example for Java libraries. Library spec XML can be created using libdoc tool from Robot Framework.

Hi Karthik, have you imported req python libraries

My bad..I missed adding Selenium libraries to TestSuite.

Any more logs you have for this, also try searching online

Download the older version of Python (2.7.14) and make sure it is installed to C:\Python27. That fixed it for me.

Hi Rubby, try restarting RIDE

Thankyou Raghav its working now by setting the default browser in settings

Try to restart RIDE

Hi Venkata, not yet created on mac

Hi Narendra, do you have any logs for this.

At what action do you get this error. Try to install again.

Hi Kavana, when you create project, you have option for type as file or directory, You selected file. Select Dir and you should get the options.

Hi Raghav, I changed the type to Dir and I can find the options now. Thanks for your help and quick response

Replied to your other comment. Pls check.

Hi Shravan, @ Raghav, i am facing issue while opening ride.py, all the previous step i had done it but not opening ride.py

Might be diff ver of wxPython is required. Can do some search over that

Hi Puja, although I cannot tell exactly unless I see some logs, this link might help you to resolve - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47240047/chromedriver-executable-needs-to-be-in-path-robot-framework-pycharm?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa

Try with chromedriver 3.6

Kasun, I am glad to know this helped.

Hi Sujit , you can put your queries in the comment section of the relevant video.

Try restarting RIDE

Hi Mahesh, as far as i remember in this tutorial i have used RIDE only. send me the time where you found pycharm, in case i missed it.

yes ideally if you goto cmd and write ride.py and enter, it should open ride ui, Not sure if you have some default setup

Great work Sir, Can we use Ride IDE and wxPython for Jython? Or would you please suggest IDE for Jython

Hi Raghav... reports and log links are disabled for me. I observed the same too in ur video. How to enable these?

Robot Framework is pretty cool. :-)

Thanks Raghav for the awesome video, keep posting more videos.

Thanks Raghav for such a nice video, I have a problem with RIDE, Report and Log are not enabled on my screen, could you help me to solve this issue.

Thanks for the tutorial Raghav. We have just started working with this new Robot framework in our project and your video is very useful to get started with it. Waiting for next video on Robot framework with more features. Thank you

May I know the suitable firefox version? I have tried with ff 47.0.1. The error was "InvalidArgumentException: Message: Missing 'type' parameter ".

Thanks for uploading this video, Please keep updating us with how to use new keywords or make testing more effective

what error are you getting.

yes Maneka, https://github.com/Selenium2Library/robotframework-extjs

you can do CTRL + SPACE , once the suggestion window comes up, click on it.

after CTRL + SPACE suggestion is displaying, but i am not able to read FULL suggestion  , Left side and Down side bar is not moving , i tried to maximize but it is also not working

Strange. Can you run the command pip check robotframework-ride  And see if you get any broken files. The last resort will be to re-install ride

Will do in some time

Thank you

Hi Saurav, I had earlier faced few compatibility issues, however now it should be okay, you can see this - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-python3

Hi, that is your system's setting. You can set the default browser for your system

as per RIDE page: RIDE runs only on the regular Python, not on Jython nor IronPython. Python 2.6 is the minimum version. Notice that similarly as Robot Framework, RIDE does not yet support Python 3. Notice also that on OS X RIDE requires 32-bit Python version. https://github.com/robotframework/RIDE/wiki/Installation-Instructions  You should be able to use any java ide like eclipse

Hi Venkata, you can try restarting RIDE.

Thanks Deepak, will continue on this.

Hi Anoop, in the console the path of report and log file is also printed. Can you check if you are able to open the same from physical location.

Thanks Raghav, it's worked

Hi, Please how did you resolve the RIDE ( Report and Log)  grayed out issue

Great to know that Priyanka, I will post more soon.

sure Anand, more videos on Robot Framework coming soon.

You're welcome Kishore. I will continue this.

With SeleniumLibrary you can use Firefox 48 and above. You will need to get gecko driver. The same way we took chrome browser driver exe in the video.

Automation Step-by-Step - Raghav Pal I used gecko driver but my broker version is 47.1.0. let me upgrade it..

Will surely do that. Thanks for watching.
