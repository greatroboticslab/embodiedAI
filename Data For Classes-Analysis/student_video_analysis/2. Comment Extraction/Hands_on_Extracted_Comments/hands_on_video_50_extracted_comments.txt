Hi there, you can refer to our MasterPi

Hi there, you may need to do some adjustment for RPi 3B

@hiwonder294   I also have a Pi 3B, what are the adjustments that need to bo made. Also can I program the robot or do I have to. use the app

@akshayaradjou8323  We have not tested the Rpi 3B but you can have a try. You may need to burn the system image of Rpi 3B first, and then modify programs according to our source code and library files. However, RPi 3B may not have enough performance to run the vision games. q2: you can program it

HI Frank, it's powered by rechargeable lithium battery which is also very convenient :D

@hiwonder294  Hi, do you have a robot that you recommend buying to learn Python?, but also that you can actually program useful things with it and not just walk

@Amrafel  Hi MasterPi is a good robto for learing python and AI games: https://hiwonder.hk/products/masterpi-hiwonder-ai-vision-robot-arm-with-meacanum-wheels-car-powered-by-raspberry-pi-open-source-robot-car?variant=39783006961751&_pos=1&_sid=4de16d9b2&_ss=r
