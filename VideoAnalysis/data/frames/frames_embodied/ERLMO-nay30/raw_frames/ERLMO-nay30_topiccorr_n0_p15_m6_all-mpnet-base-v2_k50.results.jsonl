What I learned from this video – I found this video interesting. The man controls the speed of a DC motor with a potentiometer using the circuit shown in the video. He uses an IRFP25ON to do this. I noticed some good soldering techniques in this video which I will put into practice when working on my project. Questions – I would like to know what kind of conductive sheet the man laid down between the heatsink and the chip he used. I’m also curious about how this works because the only way of controlling DC motor speed I knew of before seeing this was PWM. Conclusions The most significant things I’ve learned from these videos are that we should use a large heatsink for the two TDA2030 amplifiers we will use in phase 2. I also found two good TDA2030 circuits which we can use for the project. I found the second and fifth videos I watched to be interesting. I didn’t realize how important power factor is for conserving energy. I also didn’t realize that a circuit could be made to control the speed of a DC motor using a potentiometer. I only knew of using PWM to control DC motor speed.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERLMO-nay30 : how to make simple dc motor speed control circuit"}]}
