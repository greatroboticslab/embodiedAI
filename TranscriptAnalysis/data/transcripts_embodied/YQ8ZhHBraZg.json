throttle and then catch with more throttle."}, {"start": 35.0, "end": 39.0, "text": "So what I mean by that is this, add throttle, roll, catch with throttle."}, {"start": 39.0, "end": 42.0, "text":

loop."}, {"start": 77.0, "end": 80.0, "text": "Now that we know how to do flips and rolls, we're going to go out here to the side."}, {"start": 80.0, "end": 83.0, "text": "And I'm going to come

it."}, {"start": 114.0, "end": 115.0, "text": "Here we go."}, {"start": 115.0, "end": 117.0, "text": "So I'm doing some stuff."}, {"start": 117.0, "end": 121.0, "text": "Right rolls, left rolls,
