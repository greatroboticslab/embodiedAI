[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:03.000] Today's video, we're going to be looking at a new stack from Team Motor.
[00:00:03.220 → 00:00:07.460] Now, this is the first official ever F7 flight controller,
[00:00:07.700 → 00:00:11.700] and to be honest, the most feature-packed flight controller they've ever released.
[00:00:11.840 → 00:00:15.000] And not only that, it's bringing back memories from the old Omnibus.
[00:00:15.100 → 00:00:17.620] Now, first of all, if you don't know this or if you haven't seen my video,
[00:00:17.720 → 00:00:23.580] this is one of the best 6S ESCs I've ever tested, ever used, and done noise testing on.
[00:00:23.900 → 00:00:26.260] So right out of the box, you're getting something proper here.
[00:00:26.360 → 00:00:28.120] They also give us a PCB here.
[00:00:28.220 → 00:00:29.620] So some of you are like, well, what the heck is this?
[00:00:29.620 → 00:00:31.180] Well, this can be used for a couple things.
[00:00:31.380 → 00:00:32.840] It's to protect the flight controller,
[00:00:33.060 → 00:00:38.540] or even use double-sided tape to hold a video transmitter, a receiver, something of that nature.
[00:00:38.540 → 00:00:41.280] Or if you have your battery straps coming in from the top of the frame,
[00:00:41.660 → 00:00:43.940] that battery strap doesn't touch the flight controller,
[00:00:44.040 → 00:00:45.280] because obviously the gyro is in there,
[00:00:45.560 → 00:00:48.360] and doesn't move the flight controller and cause unwanted vibration.
[00:00:48.480 → 00:00:49.600] So it has many purposes.
[00:00:50.120 → 00:00:52.880] The only other company that usually does this is actually Maytec.
[00:00:53.000 → 00:00:54.160] So let's put this to the side.
[00:00:54.260 → 00:00:55.540] Then we get to the flight controller.
[00:00:55.620 → 00:00:56.880] The flight controller is pretty interesting.
[00:00:56.880 → 00:00:58.380] And again, this is the first F7.
[00:00:58.380 → 00:01:01.400] They're using the baby F7, which is the F722 here.
[00:01:01.560 → 00:01:04.100] They have a lot of things going on here, like pit mode.
[00:01:04.240 → 00:01:05.900] You can activate and deactivate.
[00:01:06.120 → 00:01:08.960] However, there's no 9-volt regulator, but we're going to get into this in a bit.
[00:01:09.100 → 00:01:13.200] And we've got a lot of options here that we have to enable and disable in order to get it to work.
[00:01:13.520 → 00:01:14.740] But it seems pretty proper.
[00:01:14.840 → 00:01:16.000] Obviously, Gummi's inside.
[00:01:16.460 → 00:01:19.280] And let's get into this, because I haven't gotten this far just yet.
[00:01:19.320 → 00:01:21.600] I wanted to keep it preserved for you guys.
[00:01:21.600 → 00:01:24.240] So here we've got two connectors down there, which we're going to come back to.
[00:01:24.460 → 00:01:28.900] Here we have four screws, metal screws, very long for the stack.
[00:01:29.100 → 00:01:30.360] So hopefully that'll fit most frames.
[00:01:30.540 → 00:01:34.820] We also have our nice, trusty, low ESR capacitor, which is a Rubicon.
[00:01:35.080 → 00:01:35.420] Awesome.
[00:01:35.780 → 00:01:38.420] And it is a 35-volt, 470 microfarad.
[00:01:38.800 → 00:01:39.420] Really great.
[00:01:39.540 → 00:01:40.420] You're going to need this.
[00:01:40.520 → 00:01:44.540] You always need this, especially on 6S ESCs.
[00:01:44.640 → 00:01:45.320] Actually, on everything.
[00:01:45.760 → 00:01:47.840] They also give us some extra gummies.
[00:01:47.900 → 00:01:49.880] They give us five, to be exact, which is really great.
[00:01:49.880 → 00:01:51.100] There's already four on this one.
[00:01:51.180 → 00:01:58.040] And they've also given us four PCB wires or race wire, whatever you want to call these, in the packaging, which is really great.
[00:01:58.560 → 00:01:59.600] And let's see what else.
[00:01:59.660 → 00:02:01.480] Just spacers, the nuts and everything.
[00:02:01.880 → 00:02:02.460] So that's really nice.
[00:02:02.520 → 00:02:03.940] Actually, I didn't know they had this in here.
[00:02:04.300 → 00:02:06.760] And even the XT60, pre-made, really great.
[00:02:06.920 → 00:02:09.340] Also very, very thick and very, very long.
[00:02:10.220 → 00:02:13.040] Recommended to shorten this, like, halfway is good here.
[00:02:13.400 → 00:02:15.760] The longer this is, the more noise will be in your system.
[00:02:16.140 → 00:02:17.520] And it also gives us two connectors.
[00:02:17.520 → 00:02:21.460] Now, be careful how you connect them, because one says ESC, one says FC.
[00:02:21.620 → 00:02:22.140] It's really great.
[00:02:22.200 → 00:02:22.800] They've done that.
[00:02:23.200 → 00:02:23.960] And you'll be like, well, why?
[00:02:24.020 → 00:02:25.120] They're just going straight across.
[00:02:25.280 → 00:02:27.880] Well, if you go like this, you'll see that they're actually inverted.
[00:02:28.140 → 00:02:29.560] So I'll actually zoom in here.
[00:02:29.700 → 00:02:30.900] So this is the top side.
[00:02:31.400 → 00:02:34.920] And if they weren't inverted, those black wires would be on the same place.
[00:02:34.960 → 00:02:35.740] So keep that in mind.
[00:02:35.800 → 00:02:38.120] You could blow this whole thing up if you put these backwards.
[00:02:38.480 → 00:02:41.000] So where it says ESC, you plug it into this thing.
[00:02:41.140 → 00:02:43.620] Where it says FC, you plug it into the other thing.
[00:02:43.880 → 00:02:44.700] That looks like this.
[00:02:44.700 → 00:02:45.480] And you're good to go.
[00:02:45.800 → 00:02:47.780] So let's take a closer look at the flight controller.
[00:02:48.360 → 00:02:50.580] And the ESC, there's really nothing to say about it.
[00:02:50.660 → 00:02:51.540] Then it's really good.
[00:02:51.680 → 00:02:52.140] Tested it.
[00:02:52.200 → 00:02:53.160] Have it on a couple of builds.
[00:02:53.560 → 00:02:55.540] I even blew a battery and motors.
[00:02:55.740 → 00:02:58.540] And the ESC still functions, which says a lot.
[00:02:58.660 → 00:03:01.280] And it does have really great, what is it called?
[00:03:01.340 → 00:03:03.220] Throttle response, which means no jitters.
[00:03:03.320 → 00:03:06.300] Especially on 6S, it needs a very fast microcontroller unit.
[00:03:06.300 → 00:03:08.760] And just an overall great design.
[00:03:09.040 → 00:03:12.020] And this actually gets an A plus in my opinion.
[00:03:12.340 → 00:03:14.380] Now, this thing also has a 10 volt regulator.
[00:03:14.740 → 00:03:18.920] However, it's actually not being utilized, which we'll cover in a bit here.
[00:03:19.060 → 00:03:20.180] So this has telemetry.
[00:03:20.300 → 00:03:21.240] It's a BLHeli 32.
[00:03:21.860 → 00:03:24.420] And everything you want in a 6S ESC.
[00:03:24.540 → 00:03:25.560] This is it right here.
[00:03:25.680 → 00:03:27.380] So let's put this to the side for now.
[00:03:27.440 → 00:03:29.040] And let's start covering the flight controller.
[00:03:29.040 → 00:03:32.040] Because the ESC has a really nice feature, if you might say.
[00:03:32.120 → 00:03:33.080] If you want to call it a feature.
[00:03:33.800 → 00:03:37.200] And the flight controller here does not utilize that feature.
[00:03:37.300 → 00:03:38.280] But I can understand why.
[00:03:38.360 → 00:03:39.760] Because of another feature they've added.
[00:03:40.000 → 00:03:40.200] All right.
[00:03:40.240 → 00:03:42.460] So now we're going to take a look at the flight controller.
[00:03:42.600 → 00:03:43.900] See the overall board layout.
[00:03:44.080 → 00:03:47.760] And what we can see is there's some change of heart, maybe.
[00:03:47.980 → 00:03:49.140] I think that's the way you put it.
[00:03:49.240 → 00:03:50.780] Some changes have been made here.
[00:03:50.800 → 00:03:52.180] And you can easily spot those.
[00:03:52.640 → 00:03:54.820] So here we have our 16 megabyte of flash memory.
[00:03:55.040 → 00:03:58.260] So that's really great for black box since we don't have SD card expansion.
[00:03:58.260 → 00:04:00.800] Our MPU 6000 gyro is right here.
[00:04:01.260 → 00:04:05.100] And here, I think that we're going to do some sort of either sensor fusion.
[00:04:05.720 → 00:04:07.500] Or dual gyro setups.
[00:04:07.680 → 00:04:09.060] Where like an ICM and MPU.
[00:04:09.460 → 00:04:10.900] But they've gone ahead and removed that.
[00:04:10.980 → 00:04:12.460] But the legs are still available here.
[00:04:12.500 → 00:04:14.860] Or the traces for the other gyro.
[00:04:15.640 → 00:04:18.080] Here they're probably going to use just a full blown resistor.
[00:04:18.080 → 00:04:19.440] Instead of these four right here.
[00:04:19.580 → 00:04:21.140] Which is kind of like a multi resistor.
[00:04:21.280 → 00:04:23.180] I don't know what the actual real name is for these.
[00:04:23.420 → 00:04:25.700] But instead of this one, this one, this one.
[00:04:26.000 → 00:04:26.540] There's another one.
[00:04:26.600 → 00:04:27.400] Yeah, these two right here.
[00:04:27.400 → 00:04:28.580] They would have just used this.
[00:04:28.660 → 00:04:30.200] But I guess they changed their mind here.
[00:04:31.260 → 00:04:32.100] What else do we have?
[00:04:32.260 → 00:04:33.680] Here we have our switching regulator.
[00:04:33.780 → 00:04:34.860] It's just a 5 volt regulator.
[00:04:35.200 → 00:04:36.800] And again, there's no 10 volt regulator.
[00:04:36.960 → 00:04:39.480] There is just a 5 volt and a 3.3 volt.
[00:04:39.780 → 00:04:41.560] So that pretty much covers this side of the board.
[00:04:41.640 → 00:04:43.500] On the back side, nothing special either.
[00:04:43.580 → 00:04:44.180] No barometer.
[00:04:45.280 → 00:04:47.080] But we do have a transistor.
[00:04:47.160 → 00:04:49.340] I think this is the transistor that's in charge of pit mode.
[00:04:49.640 → 00:04:50.680] Now this is a real pit mode.
[00:04:50.760 → 00:04:54.600] Where it actually disconnects the power to your video transmitter.
[00:04:54.600 → 00:04:56.300] And that would be enabled from here.
[00:04:56.400 → 00:04:59.960] So you're going to have to do some bridges before you get this thing completely going.
[00:05:00.320 → 00:05:01.900] And this is where I'm going to cover in this video.
[00:05:02.680 → 00:05:04.160] We have our OSD right here.
[00:05:04.440 → 00:05:05.900] Little baby tantalum capacitors.
[00:05:06.020 → 00:05:07.020] Which OSD is this one?
[00:05:07.400 → 00:05:09.780] This is the 3.3 volt OSD here.
[00:05:10.200 → 00:05:11.620] So this is a 3.3 volt.
[00:05:11.680 → 00:05:12.400] It's a Chinese one.
[00:05:13.000 → 00:05:14.520] And what else do we have?
[00:05:14.960 → 00:05:16.400] Little baby tantalum capacitors.
[00:05:16.520 → 00:05:17.040] Our F7.
[00:05:17.160 → 00:05:17.940] Some diode here.
[00:05:18.020 → 00:05:20.080] The diode's coming in, I think, from the main battery voltage.
[00:05:20.520 → 00:05:21.420] Now it's also really nice.
[00:05:21.500 → 00:05:26.120] This takes raw battery voltage between, I think, basically up to 6S.
[00:05:26.220 → 00:05:27.760] And I think a minimum of 2S.
[00:05:28.160 → 00:05:29.160] Just check the documentation.
[00:05:29.420 → 00:05:30.240] The link's down below.
[00:05:30.320 → 00:05:31.500] You can go ahead and check this stack up.
[00:05:31.500 → 00:05:33.760] So now let's cover how we would go about connecting him.
[00:05:33.900 → 00:05:35.520] So the first thing we need to find is the arrow.
[00:05:35.620 → 00:05:38.660] And this arrow should be up top and pointing towards the camera.
[00:05:39.060 → 00:05:41.900] So if our camera was right here, this would be installed on our quadcopter.
[00:05:41.900 → 00:05:43.540] Just like this.
[00:05:43.860 → 00:05:46.300] And next thing we have is the video transmitter.
[00:05:46.520 → 00:05:47.420] Also the camera.
[00:05:48.120 → 00:05:51.480] And the receiver can be placed on any R-pad, basically.
[00:05:51.560 → 00:05:52.500] Because it's an F7.
[00:05:52.920 → 00:05:57.060] So it won't matter if you have S-Bus, I-Bus, FlySky, FRSky, or Spectrum.
[00:05:57.360 → 00:05:59.100] You can put them on any R-pad.
[00:05:59.200 → 00:05:59.660] It'll work.
[00:06:00.440 → 00:06:03.000] However, I don't recommend you put it on RX4.
[00:06:03.100 → 00:06:06.080] Because RX4 is being utilized for the telemetry here.
[00:06:06.380 → 00:06:07.180] Keep that in mind.
[00:06:07.560 → 00:06:09.600] Now, here on the left side, we have camera.
[00:06:09.600 → 00:06:12.040] So we have our ground, our positive.
[00:06:12.500 → 00:06:14.440] So ground would be the black wire for your camera.
[00:06:14.780 → 00:06:16.640] The positive is going to be the red.
[00:06:17.140 → 00:06:18.600] CC is camera control.
[00:06:18.740 → 00:06:21.740] So if your camera has OSD, you can actually connect the wire here.
[00:06:21.880 → 00:06:27.080] It'll enable you to control the OSD of the camera and change its settings, which is really cool.
[00:06:27.480 → 00:06:28.700] And we have the video input.
[00:06:28.840 → 00:06:31.680] This would be the yellow wire from your camera.
[00:06:31.820 → 00:06:32.560] Keep that in mind.
[00:06:32.560 → 00:06:36.320] However, if you plug it like that, the camera is not going to boot.
[00:06:36.520 → 00:06:38.780] Because you're going to have to bridge this right here.
[00:06:39.460 → 00:06:42.500] So if you wanted your camera to get 5 volts, which is highly recommended.
[00:06:42.680 → 00:06:45.520] And all cameras just basically take 5 volts and up.
[00:06:45.920 → 00:06:47.860] But the safe side is just to give them 5 volts.
[00:06:48.520 → 00:06:52.040] Would be to bridge this left one with this middle one.
[00:06:52.460 → 00:06:53.960] And that would give it 5 volts.
[00:06:54.040 → 00:06:56.380] But if you wanted to give it battery voltage for the camera,
[00:06:56.660 → 00:07:00.380] then you're going to have to bridge the middle one with the battery voltage.
[00:07:00.380 → 00:07:01.940] So keep that in mind.
[00:07:02.060 → 00:07:05.840] Now, I never recommend adding or giving straight battery voltage to the camera
[00:07:05.840 → 00:07:09.560] because the onboard filtration for the cameras is absolute trash.
[00:07:09.780 → 00:07:10.680] So keep that in mind.
[00:07:10.820 → 00:07:12.700] And I've seen that happen a couple times.
[00:07:13.080 → 00:07:16.820] So it's recommended just to give them from whatever regulator you have.
[00:07:17.100 → 00:07:18.440] 9, 10, 5 volts.
[00:07:18.760 → 00:07:21.600] So 5 volt here is what I would do on mine.
[00:07:21.920 → 00:07:23.080] And our camera is done there.
[00:07:23.400 → 00:07:25.460] Now, here is the video transmitter part.
[00:07:25.920 → 00:07:29.360] Now, the video transmitter can also give 5 volt or battery voltage.
[00:07:29.360 → 00:07:32.120] Again, most likely going to be going battery voltage.
[00:07:32.640 → 00:07:35.680] And the way we would connect this would be the yellow wire would go to the VO,
[00:07:36.020 → 00:07:37.300] which means video output,
[00:07:37.700 → 00:07:40.900] because the video would come in from the camera to the video input.
[00:07:41.260 → 00:07:41.980] Go inside.
[00:07:42.100 → 00:07:42.820] Go to this chip.
[00:07:43.280 → 00:07:44.700] Put the on-screen display on.
[00:07:44.900 → 00:07:47.620] And pop it out down to your goggles from your video transmitter.
[00:07:47.880 → 00:07:50.120] Now, T3 here would be for smart audio.
[00:07:50.780 → 00:07:54.220] And with that or any other protocol that allow you to change the channel
[00:07:54.220 → 00:07:57.240] and output power through the on-screen display.
[00:07:57.240 → 00:07:59.280] So that's where you want to put that.
[00:07:59.760 → 00:08:02.740] And now, R3 would be not usable anymore.
[00:08:02.860 → 00:08:03.700] So keep that in mind.
[00:08:03.800 → 00:08:08.020] So if one of the pads that have a T and R, for example, now the T3 is used,
[00:08:08.380 → 00:08:11.420] we're not going to be able to use the R3 for anything else.
[00:08:11.520 → 00:08:12.300] So keep that in mind.
[00:08:12.620 → 00:08:14.040] Very important to take note of that.
[00:08:14.540 → 00:08:16.300] And here we have our plus and our minus.
[00:08:16.520 → 00:08:19.000] Plus is going to be the red wire for your video transmitter.
[00:08:19.100 → 00:08:20.520] And minus is going to be the black wire.
[00:08:20.840 → 00:08:23.160] Now, if your video transmitter takes battery voltage,
[00:08:23.300 → 00:08:25.540] you'd bridge the left one with the middle one.
[00:08:25.540 → 00:08:28.940] If it takes 5 volts, you'd bridge the right one with the middle one.
[00:08:29.300 → 00:08:29.980] And you're set to go.
[00:08:30.340 → 00:08:33.140] If you don't bridge these, these two won't get power.
[00:08:33.280 → 00:08:34.040] Keep that in mind.
[00:08:34.280 → 00:08:37.380] Also, a little nice tip or trick, if you might not know this.
[00:08:37.900 → 00:08:40.580] If you're unable to bridge it, no matter what the hell you did,
[00:08:40.880 → 00:08:44.260] then you could just take your red wire, put it to battery right there.
[00:08:44.280 → 00:08:45.420] Because that's basically battery right there.
[00:08:45.740 → 00:08:46.660] It would be the same thing.
[00:08:47.040 → 00:08:48.360] And you can do that and get away with it.
[00:08:48.440 → 00:08:50.340] So yeah, if you didn't want to bridge them, you can do that.
[00:08:50.560 → 00:08:53.100] If you wanted 5 volt, you could just solder it to this guy and you're good to go.
[00:08:53.320 → 00:08:54.460] Same thing goes for that one.
[00:08:54.460 → 00:08:57.020] Next, let's cover the receiver.
[00:08:57.260 → 00:08:58.740] How would we connect our receiver?
[00:08:59.360 → 00:09:01.480] Now, IBUS and Spectrum.
[00:09:01.680 → 00:09:02.040] I mean, sorry.
[00:09:02.280 → 00:09:06.680] Yeah, IBUS, Spectrum and FR Sky, whatever protocol you're using,
[00:09:06.780 → 00:09:08.740] is going to be connected in this area right here.
[00:09:08.860 → 00:09:13.280] The only difference is with Spectrum is you're going to give it possibly 3.3 volts
[00:09:13.280 → 00:09:14.740] because those take 3.3 volts.
[00:09:14.820 → 00:09:17.380] Anyways, let's cover IBUS and SBUS.
[00:09:17.380 → 00:09:20.720] So if you had an IBUS, Flag Sky or an FR Sky receiver,
[00:09:21.120 → 00:09:25.340] you'd want to put the SBUS or IBUS signal on the R5 right here.
[00:09:25.620 → 00:09:27.000] That's where I would want to put it.
[00:09:27.040 → 00:09:28.040] So you put it right there.
[00:09:28.400 → 00:09:32.480] And then you want to put the black wire, which is the ground, right here on the G.
[00:09:32.960 → 00:09:34.220] And this would be 5 volts.
[00:09:34.300 → 00:09:35.560] So that would be the red wire.
[00:09:35.560 → 00:09:38.360] And then now you have a connected receiver.
[00:09:38.520 → 00:09:39.580] So you're good in that perspective.
[00:09:39.720 → 00:09:41.820] Now, Spectrum, usually 3.3 volts.
[00:09:41.960 → 00:09:44.260] I would still put the signal on R5.
[00:09:44.680 → 00:09:45.880] I would still give it ground.
[00:09:46.060 → 00:09:50.000] But instead of 5 volts, I would give it 3.3 volts for the red wire.
[00:09:50.480 → 00:09:51.240] And you're good.
[00:09:51.540 → 00:09:52.220] Just that's it.
[00:09:52.500 → 00:09:56.780] And this is really cool because it even supports PPM without having to do anything.
[00:09:56.900 → 00:09:58.920] So if you're still using a receiver that uses PPM,
[00:09:59.320 → 00:10:01.040] you just take it right there and you're good to go.
[00:10:01.040 → 00:10:05.600] Now, if we take a closer look here, we also see we have an R3 and a T3 pad.
[00:10:05.800 → 00:10:11.180] However, you will not be able to use these two if you're using the T3 up here.
[00:10:11.300 → 00:10:12.060] So keep that in mind.
[00:10:12.120 → 00:10:14.620] So if you are using smart audio or some kind of a TRAMP protocol,
[00:10:15.280 → 00:10:17.340] you can't use these for anything else.
[00:10:17.380 → 00:10:19.760] So keep that in mind and don't screw up.
[00:10:19.840 → 00:10:21.740] We also have a dedicated RSSI pad.
[00:10:21.840 → 00:10:26.040] So if your receiver gives some sort of RSSI signal from a dedicated wire,
[00:10:26.220 → 00:10:29.020] then you can just install that there and you should have that set up.
[00:10:29.020 → 00:10:32.600] And here we see we have R1 and T1.
[00:10:32.700 → 00:10:35.580] Now, you'll be able to use this for whatever your heart desires,
[00:10:35.680 → 00:10:36.600] which is really great.
[00:10:36.940 → 00:10:39.260] And you can use any sensor or anything.
[00:10:39.400 → 00:10:44.100] For example, I would actually possibly put TBS Crossfire here
[00:10:44.100 → 00:10:46.480] because, you know, that's how it would work.
[00:10:46.560 → 00:10:48.560] It uses a full UR, the R and the T.
[00:10:48.820 → 00:10:51.060] I'll probably put the, you know, TBS Crossfire right here
[00:10:51.060 → 00:10:52.380] and I'll be good to go.
[00:10:52.380 → 00:10:55.440] Now, if we take a look on this side right here,
[00:10:56.380 → 00:10:59.440] we see we have E5 and E6.
[00:10:59.660 → 00:11:01.100] You know, like what the hell is E5 and E6?
[00:11:01.320 → 00:11:04.080] These are two extra motor output signals
[00:11:04.080 → 00:11:06.220] that can be remapped to do anything you want,
[00:11:06.340 → 00:11:09.080] which is also something really nice that they've done that here.
[00:11:09.180 → 00:11:11.260] They didn't have to, but it's also, you know,
[00:11:11.260 → 00:11:13.440] it's just a little couple extra pads.
[00:11:13.500 → 00:11:14.480] You can do whatever you want with,
[00:11:14.540 → 00:11:16.560] not whatever you want with, but you can do quite a lot with.
[00:11:16.560 → 00:11:19.580] Here we have an R2 and a T2,
[00:11:19.740 → 00:11:21.740] which is not being used by anything else.
[00:11:21.780 → 00:11:24.660] So you'll be able to use these for anything you wanted to,
[00:11:24.760 → 00:11:25.480] which is really great.
[00:11:25.760 → 00:11:28.560] And we also have a ground 5 volt, SCL and SDA.
[00:11:28.700 → 00:11:30.000] These would be for like a magnometer.
[00:11:30.420 → 00:11:32.860] Some sensors use these pads so you can connect those there.
[00:11:33.240 → 00:11:34.420] And then this is very important.
[00:11:34.540 → 00:11:37.580] Now, R4 and T4, if you're using ESC telemetry,
[00:11:37.660 → 00:11:39.060] it's on RX4 right here.
[00:11:39.180 → 00:11:40.620] So you're not gonna be able to use these.
[00:11:40.680 → 00:11:41.520] So keep that in mind.
[00:11:41.960 → 00:11:44.800] If you have the, you know, the connector with this ESC plugged in
[00:11:44.800 → 00:11:45.880] and ESC telemetry working,
[00:11:45.880 → 00:11:47.620] these are basically used up.
[00:11:47.680 → 00:11:48.700] You can't use these two,
[00:11:49.020 → 00:11:51.160] which is something very important to take note of here.
[00:11:52.020 → 00:11:54.960] Now, if you take a look at the pads here,
[00:11:55.040 → 00:11:56.000] also this connector,
[00:11:56.120 → 00:11:57.020] but we're gonna take a look at the pads
[00:11:57.020 → 00:11:57.800] because it's the same thing.
[00:11:58.280 → 00:12:00.560] For example, if you're not using the same ESC,
[00:12:01.020 → 00:12:03.380] you're gonna have to solder to this right here,
[00:12:03.420 → 00:12:04.560] unless you wanna play with the wires.
[00:12:04.940 → 00:12:06.400] But if you have to solder, it's very simple.
[00:12:06.520 → 00:12:08.180] Everything is really well labeled here.
[00:12:08.600 → 00:12:10.240] For example, here's the RX4.
[00:12:10.320 → 00:12:11.800] This would be for the ESC telemetry.
[00:12:11.980 → 00:12:15.000] Then the current wire, motors 1, 2, 3, and 4.
[00:12:15.000 → 00:12:16.740] And then we have positive.
[00:12:16.980 → 00:12:18.600] This would be battery voltage.
[00:12:18.960 → 00:12:20.660] So up to 6S.
[00:12:20.740 → 00:12:22.200] So keep that in mind, not 5 volt.
[00:12:22.320 → 00:12:23.660] This would be battery voltage.
[00:12:23.880 → 00:12:25.800] And then this would be a ground here.
[00:12:26.200 → 00:12:28.840] And here we have another ground 5 volt buzzer and LED.
[00:12:28.940 → 00:12:29.920] These are separate here.
[00:12:30.400 → 00:12:33.780] These are, if you wanted to connect a buzzer and or LEDs,
[00:12:34.140 → 00:12:35.920] this is where you'd connect them right here.
[00:12:36.100 → 00:12:37.700] So for example, for connecting a buzzer,
[00:12:37.740 → 00:12:39.680] I'd put the buzzer positive on 5 volt
[00:12:39.680 → 00:12:41.980] and the negative on buzz minus.
[00:12:41.980 → 00:12:44.100] It's very important because the buzzers get initialized
[00:12:44.100 → 00:12:44.860] through the ground here.
[00:12:45.560 → 00:12:47.280] LED, kind of the same thing,
[00:12:47.480 → 00:12:49.040] but I wouldn't use the buzzer ground.
[00:12:49.320 → 00:12:51.040] I would give it ground, which is a black wire.
[00:12:51.500 → 00:12:52.800] Red wire is the 5 volt.
[00:12:53.060 → 00:12:54.280] And then the LED signal here.
[00:12:54.380 → 00:12:56.760] This is the signal that's going to change the color on the LED.
[00:12:57.220 → 00:12:58.260] So keep that in mind.
[00:12:58.380 → 00:12:59.380] Hopefully that made sense.
[00:12:59.620 → 00:12:59.760] All right.
[00:12:59.780 → 00:13:01.200] So this area here is very important
[00:13:01.200 → 00:13:03.820] because this area has to do with your video transmitter
[00:13:03.820 → 00:13:06.320] if you gave it power from the video transmitter part.
[00:13:06.380 → 00:13:07.640] Because this is where the transistor
[00:13:07.640 → 00:13:10.040] that's in charge of your video transmitter is.
[00:13:10.040 → 00:13:13.860] Now, whether you can choose the video transmitter always on
[00:13:13.860 → 00:13:16.200] or you can choose pit mode,
[00:13:16.320 → 00:13:20.280] which means you could assign a switch on your controller
[00:13:20.280 → 00:13:22.860] in order to give power to the video transmitter.
[00:13:23.100 → 00:13:24.300] So you can do it both ways.
[00:13:24.380 → 00:13:25.960] Now, if you're really not experienced,
[00:13:26.460 → 00:13:28.500] just bridge the left two together
[00:13:28.500 → 00:13:30.340] and you won't have a headache.
[00:13:30.480 → 00:13:32.380] Overall layout seems to be pretty good.
[00:13:32.440 → 00:13:33.120] I've seen better.
[00:13:33.780 → 00:13:35.420] But, you know, I wish they've gotten away,
[00:13:35.420 → 00:13:37.420] just, you know, removed these here
[00:13:37.420 → 00:13:39.540] from their latest design before going into production.
[00:13:39.540 → 00:13:42.000] Because this doesn't feel very professional.
[00:13:42.460 → 00:13:44.680] Unlike their ESCs, their ESCs are really great.
[00:13:44.780 → 00:13:46.080] Hopefully their flight controller is good.
[00:13:46.320 → 00:13:48.320] I still haven't used one of their flight controllers yet,
[00:13:48.400 → 00:13:49.140] if I remember correctly.
[00:13:49.480 → 00:13:50.640] This might be the first one.
[00:13:50.700 → 00:13:51.200] Not sure yet.
[00:13:51.280 → 00:13:53.460] I still have a bunch of builds to go fly and test,
[00:13:53.540 → 00:13:54.540] which I haven't still tested.
[00:13:55.060 → 00:13:55.700] So, yeah.
[00:13:55.860 → 00:13:57.080] Everything here is linked down below.
[00:13:57.220 → 00:13:58.920] Let me know what you guys think down in the comment section
[00:13:58.920 → 00:14:00.080] if anyone's used any of these.
[00:14:00.560 → 00:14:03.180] And I'll see you in the next one.
[00:14:03.180 → 00:14:16.220] Thank you.
