Based on the provided transcript segment, I've extracted some coherent topics:

1. **Opto isolator**: The speaker discusses the importance of an opto isolator in the circuit, which allows for safe isolation between different voltage levels (5V and 12V).
2. **Circuit operation**: The speaker explains how the circuit works, including the output options ("either one or the other") and the role of the H-bridge.
3. **Power control**: The speaker highlights the power control circuitry and its importance in controlling higher-voltage circuits using an opto coupler.
4. **Isolation**: The speaker emphasizes the complete isolation between 5V and 12V circuitry, which ensures safe operation and prevents electrical shock or damage.

These topics are woven throughout the transcript segment, with the speaker providing explanations and examples to illustrate their points.
