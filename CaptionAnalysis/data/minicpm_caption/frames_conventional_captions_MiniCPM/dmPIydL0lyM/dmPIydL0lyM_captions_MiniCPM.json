The filter is represented by the letters \"fc\" and \"f2\" in the image, which stand for the cutoff frequency and the frequency at which the filter begins to attenuate the signal, respectively. The graph shows the relationship between the input signal and the output signal, with the output signal being the difference between the input and the filter's attenuation. The graph is divided into two sections, one representing the input signal and the other representing the output signal. The filter is set to block frequencies between 1 kHz and 10 kHz. The image is a simple yet effective representation of the concept of a Band Stop Filter."

The filter is composed of two stages: a first stage with a cutoff frequency of 1kHz and a second stage with a cutoff frequency of 1kHz. The second stage is an even filter, which is indicated by the presence of a zero at the midpoint of the second stage's frequency range. The graph is colored in blue, which suggests a low-pass filter. The filter's cutoff frequencies are represented by the vertical lines in the graph, and the filter's gain is represented by the horizontal lines. The graph is labeled with the values of the filter's gain and the frequency of the first and second stages. The graph also includes a legend indicating the types of the filter stages. The overall structure of the graph provides a clear visual representation of the Band Stop Filter."

The graph is divided into three regions, each labeled with a different term: \"1kHz\", \"1kHz - 2kHz\", and \"1kHz - 2kHz - 6kHz\". \n\nIn the region labeled \"1kHz\", the graph shows a curve that extends from the left to the right, indicating a continuous wave. This curve represents the frequency response of the filter, showing that the filter allows all frequencies below 1kHz to pass through.\n\nThe region labeled \"1kHz - 2kHz\" shows a steep drop in the frequency response, indicating that the filter starts to stop allowing frequencies above 1kHz to pass through. This is the characteristic of a Band Stop Filter, which is designed to block specific frequency ranges.\n\nThe region labeled \"1kHz - 2kHz - 6kHz\" shows a similar steep drop, but with a slight slope at the bottom. This indicates that the filter starts to allow frequencies above 2kHz to pass through, but not below 1kHz. This is the typical behavior of a Band Stop Filter, where the filter allows frequencies above a certain threshold to pass through.\n\nThe graph also includes a vertical line labeled \"f2\", which represents the frequency at which the filter starts to allow frequencies above 2kHz to pass through. This is typically around 2kHz, although the exact value can vary depending on the design of the filter.\n\nThe graph also includes a horizontal line labeled \"f1\", which represents the frequency at which the filter starts to allow frequencies below 1kHz to pass through. This is typically around 1kHz, although the exact value can vary depending on the design of the filter.\n\nThe graph also includes a horizontal line labeled \"f3\", which represents the frequency at which the filter starts to allow frequencies above 6kHz to pass through. This is typically around 6kHz, although the exact value can vary depending on the design of the filter.\n\nOverall, the graph provides a clear visual representation of the characteristics of a Band Stop Filter, including its frequency response and the specific frequencies at which it starts to allow frequencies to pass through."
