[00:00:01.000 → 00:00:06.500] In a previous video I showed you how to create a simple class AB audio amplifier
[00:00:06.500 → 00:00:13.500] that consists of any 5534-bamp and a push-pull bipolar junction transistor output stage.
[00:00:13.500 → 00:00:19.000] Now, even though the circuit did work decently, there was one problem.
[00:00:19.000 → 00:00:20.500] It's power loss.
[00:00:20.500 → 00:00:26.500] We can identify its cause by taking a look at the simplified functional block diagram.
[00:00:26.500 → 00:00:32.500] Firstly, our originally applied audio signal gets its voltage amplified by an op-amp.
[00:00:32.500 → 00:00:39.500] Since such op-amps can only supply very little power, the next part of the circuit is a BJT output stage
[00:00:39.500 → 00:00:46.500] that modulates a supply voltage of 12 volts to become the audio signal that is not only voltage amplified
[00:00:46.500 → 00:00:50.500] but can also supply sufficient current for the speaker.
[00:00:50.500 → 00:00:55.000] The only problem is that the transistors work in the active region,
[00:00:55.000 → 00:01:00.000] which means there exists a noticeable voltage drop across the collector emitter path
[00:01:00.000 → 00:01:08.000] and thus power loss is created, which leads to an overall efficiency of around 50 to 60%.
[00:01:08.000 → 00:01:13.000] To increase this efficiency though, we can utilize another audio amp kind,
[00:01:13.000 → 00:01:19.000] a class D amp to be precise, with an efficiency of up to 95%.
[00:01:19.000 → 00:01:23.000] So in this video, I will show you how such an audio amp works
[00:01:23.000 → 00:01:29.000] and how we can create our own DIY version, which consists of common components.
[00:01:29.000 → 00:01:31.000] Let's get started!
[00:01:31.000 → 00:01:49.000] First off, let's have a look at the simplified functional block diagram of a class D amp.
[00:01:49.000 → 00:01:56.000] On the left side, we got our audio signal, which is connected to the non-inverting input of a comparator.
[00:01:56.000 → 00:02:04.000] The inverting input however, gets connected to a triangle wave with a frequency of above 200 kilohertz.
[00:02:04.000 → 00:02:09.000] Now whenever the voltage of our audio signal is higher than the triangle voltage,
[00:02:09.000 → 00:02:14.000] the output of the comparator gets pulled high and vice versa.
[00:02:14.000 → 00:02:21.000] This way, we basically modulated our audio signal with maximum frequencies of around 20 kilohertz
[00:02:21.000 → 00:02:26.000] into a high-frequent square wave, which then connects to a MOSFET driver.
[00:02:26.000 → 00:02:30.000] The driver obviously turns on and off two MOSFETs.
[00:02:30.000 → 00:02:33.000] The high side one according to the high voltage levels,
[00:02:33.000 → 00:02:37.000] and the low side one according to the low voltage levels.
[00:02:37.000 → 00:02:42.000] This way, we get a powerful high-frequent square wave at the MOSFETs output,
[00:02:42.000 → 00:02:46.000] which since the MOSFETs were switched on and off in their ohmic region,
[00:02:46.000 → 00:02:52.000] with a low drain to source voltage drop, created very little power losses.
[00:02:52.000 → 00:02:58.000] Now we can recreate the original audio signal by adding an LC low-pass filter,
[00:02:58.000 → 00:03:02.000] which like the name implies, filters out all the high frequencies,
[00:03:02.000 → 00:03:06.000] and leaves us with our original, now amplified audio signal.
[00:03:06.000 → 00:03:18.000] As suitable components, we can use a 555 timer, a LM393, a 74HC04 to create an inverted signal of the high-frequent square wave,
[00:03:18.000 → 00:03:26.000] which is mandatory for the IR2113 MOSFET driver, and two IRLZ44N MOSFETs.
[00:03:26.000 → 00:03:33.000] Before we can solder a proper circuit though, I utilized the free EasyEDA circuit design software,
[00:03:33.000 → 00:03:36.000] to create an appropriate schematic.
[00:03:36.000 → 00:03:42.000] By utilizing the online component library, I imported all the required ICs and passive components,
[00:03:42.000 → 00:03:49.000] and afterwards connected them all to one another, according to the previously discussed functional block diagram.
[00:03:49.000 → 00:03:55.000] The only question left to answer, was what kind of values should be used for the LC filter.
[00:03:55.000 → 00:04:04.000] According to a commercial class D amp that I had lying around, inductances of 22μH should be suitable.
[00:04:04.000 → 00:04:09.000] The only inductors I had lying around though, were 33μH ones.
[00:04:09.000 → 00:04:15.000] So I connected two of them in parallel, in order to create a 16.5μH value,
[00:04:15.000 → 00:04:22.000] and wrote down the two formulas to calculate the inductance and capacity of a LC low-pass filter.
[00:04:22.000 → 00:04:28.000] If we rearrange the inductor formula, and insert the load impedance of 4Ω,
[00:04:28.000 → 00:04:33.000] according to the speaker properties, and the inductance of 16.5μH,
[00:04:33.000 → 00:04:38.000] we can calculate a cutoff frequency of around 40kHz,
[00:04:38.000 → 00:04:46.000] at which the original voltage amplitude will be lowered by 3dB, or 40% of the original amplitude.
[00:04:46.000 → 00:04:54.000] By inserting this frequency into the capacitor formula, we get a capacitance of around 1.03μF,
[00:04:54.000 → 00:05:00.000] which I created by connecting five 0.22μF capacitors in parallel.
[00:05:00.000 → 00:05:05.000] And now that the schematic was complete, I gathered all the required components,
[00:05:05.000 → 00:05:08.000] and started soldering them to a piece of perfboard.
[00:05:08.000 → 00:05:13.000] As always, I tried to utilize silvered copper wire for the most part,
[00:05:13.000 → 00:05:17.000] but still had to use a bit of hookup wire at the end.
[00:05:17.000 → 00:05:21.000] And of course, you can find reference pictures of my perfboard layout,
[00:05:21.000 → 00:05:25.000] as well as the schematic for this project, in the video description.
[00:05:25.000 → 00:05:29.000] After three hours of soldering, the circuit was complete,
[00:05:29.000 → 00:05:36.000] and it was time to insert all the ICs, connect a 15V power supply to the input,
[00:05:36.000 → 00:05:38.000] and a speaker to the output.
[00:05:38.000 → 00:05:41.000] As a first test, I hooked up my function generator,
[00:05:41.000 → 00:05:47.000] set to a sine wave with a frequency of only 1Hz to the audio input.
[00:05:47.000 → 00:05:54.000] Since the 555 timer creates a triangle voltage between around 1.3 and 2.3 of the supply voltage,
[00:05:54.000 → 00:05:59.000] we also have to use a potentiometer to add a DC offset to the sine wave,
[00:05:59.000 → 00:06:04.000] so that it is completely submerged inside the triangle wave.
[00:06:04.000 → 00:06:07.000] If we now take a look at the output of the comparator,
[00:06:07.000 → 00:06:14.000] we can see how the slowly changing 1Hz sine wave creates the modulated high-frequent square wave.
[00:06:14.000 → 00:06:19.000] And if we increase the frequency to a value that is closer to proper music,
[00:06:19.000 → 00:06:23.000] the output definitely looks crazy and confusing,
[00:06:23.000 → 00:06:26.000] but the theory pretty much stays the same.
[00:06:26.000 → 00:06:33.000] But by using lower frequencies, we can actually create a lot of visible vibrations of the speaker cone,
[00:06:33.000 → 00:06:39.000] which showcases that this class D-Amp is pretty damn powerful for its simplicity.
[00:06:39.000 → 00:06:44.000] And as you would have expected it, by increasing the frequency of the sine wave,
[00:06:44.000 → 00:06:49.000] we produce higher tones, which means that the amp works without a problem.
[00:06:49.000 → 00:06:56.000] So I replaced the function generator with my smartphone and tested the music playback capabilities of the amp.
[00:06:56.000 → 00:07:03.000] As you can hear, the music playback also worked like a charm, but the volume was a bit low.
[00:07:03.000 → 00:07:10.000] The reason for that was that the music signal only features a peak-to-peak voltage of around half a volt,
[00:07:10.000 → 00:07:15.000] while the function generator easily created peak-to-peak voltages of 4 volts.
[00:07:15.000 → 00:07:23.000] So as an afterthought, I added an LM386 op-amp in between the input audio signal and the comparator,
[00:07:23.000 → 00:07:26.000] which didn't even require complementary components.
[00:07:26.000 → 00:07:32.000] Afterwards, the audio signal consisted of a peak-to-peak voltage of 4 volts as well,
[00:07:32.000 → 00:07:38.000] which was suitable to create a much louder playback of the music through the class D-Amp.
[00:07:38.000 → 00:07:42.000] Now of course, this circuit is definitely not perfect.
[00:07:42.000 → 00:07:46.000] However, the audio quality is pretty decent.
[00:07:46.000 → 00:07:49.000] And more importantly, maybe you learned something new.
