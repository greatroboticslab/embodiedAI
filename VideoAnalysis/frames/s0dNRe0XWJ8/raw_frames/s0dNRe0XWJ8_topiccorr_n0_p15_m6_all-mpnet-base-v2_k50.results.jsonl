There's a process to use a flight recorder and what kinds of maneuvers need to happen in order to have the proper data to work with.If there are any vibrational issues, anything at all, go back to step 1, there's a mechanical issue that needs to be solved.When looking at the blackbox data you're looking for resonance, well, looking for it because it's undesirable.
