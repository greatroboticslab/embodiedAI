      "coverage_text": "Welcome to my video. The subject here is going to be optocouplers theory operation and circuits.\nI'm your host, Lewis Laughlin. Visit my website at www.bristolwatch.com.\nObjective to understand the basic operation of optocouplers, their types, and use in power control circuits with Arduino and PIC, etc.\nThere will be a couple of short live video clips at the end of this presentation.\nA typical optocoupler is usually a 6-pin device that has generally an LED infrared emitter and some type of light sensor.\nIf we turn on the LED, it turns on the light sensor.\nThe light sensor can be a transistor or it can be any number of things.\nThe big advantage of optocouplers is electrical and noise isolation.\nThe isolation potential can go up into thousands of volts.\nSome of them are rated at 7,000 or 10,000 volts electrical isolation.\nAs shown here, it can be a number of detectors.\nIt could be a light activated SCR.\nIt could be a digital output.\nIt could be a Darlington transistor.\nThere's all kinds of detectors.\nBut they all have the basic same purpose.\nVoltage isolation between input and output.\nFor example, this part number, H11AA1, has dual back-to-back infrared emitters.\nQuite handy for making things such as a zero crossing detector.\nSometimes we will use optocouplers in conjunction with secondary components to make solid-state relays.\nWhat you're seeing pictured here is an input protection circuit.\nIt can work with any of these optocouplers.\nThey can have a range from 3 to 30 volts.\nEither though the LED itself has a rating of probably 1.2 to 1.8 volts,\nthe addition of this 2-watt resistor and Q1, which is an NPN transistor like a 2N2222,\nas the voltage increases, the current flow will increase through the LED.\nAnd of course, it creates a larger voltage drop across this 47-ohm resistor,\ncutting this transistor Q1 on and shunting the current through Q1 instead of the LED.\nThat's how your protection circuit works.\nThis is your very most basic optocoupler circuit.\nGenerally, we tie the LED through a resistor to ground.\nAnd connect it to generally an I.O. pin of an Arduino, PIC, or whatever.\nA high, of course, 5 volts or 3 or whatever you're using,\nturns the LED on.\nThe LED light onto the base of an internal phototransistor\ncuts on the phototransistor and completing a path to ground.\nThis circuit is fine, except it suffers from low-power handling capabilities.\nOptocouplers are generally low-power devices.\nSo we have to look into using optocouplers to control more powerful devices\nto really handle heavy jobs.\nThis particular one, the 4N25, is rated at 30 volts.\nI'm referring to the detector transistor at 150 milliamps.\nNot a lot of power.\nAll right.\nWhat we have done here is here is our 4N25 optocoupler.\nWe have connected it off to 24 volts VCC.\nAnd through the collector and through the emitter,\nwe've connected a 1K resistor to the base of a TIP120.\nThis is a power Darlington transistor rated, I think, at 5 amps.\nWhen I have a high on the LED, it switches on.\nIt switches on the detector transistor,\ncreates a base emitter current flow through the transistor,\nand switches on the lamp.\nIn this case, a light bulb.\nHere is another variation of the same circuit,\nexcept this time we are using a PNP Darlington transistor,\nsuch as a TIP125.\nNotice something different about this circuit\nas opposed to the previous circuit.\nThis circuit had the same electrical ground on the microcontroller,\nand the secondary output at the 24 volts.\nHere, we have completely severed the secondary power supply totally\nfrom the microprocessor.\nThere is no electrical connection.\nThere is only a light connection.\nAgain, I could have done this very same thing\nwith the NPN Darlington that we saw earlier.\nA variation of this is called a solid-state relay.\nAnd can use a plain old PNP transistor if you want to.\nHere is another variation,\nusing this time an N-channel MOSFET.\nWhat am I doing here?\nI'm using the 4N25 when I switch it on\nto apply voltage to the gate of Q1, the MOSFET.\nIt will immediately turn it on.\nIt will create a current path and light up the light bulb.\nIt's that simple.\nBe careful, though.\nYou need to read the VGS rating,\nthat's voltage gain source,\nin the MOSFET spec sheet.\nDo not exceed it.\nMost of the ones I use in my videos\nis rated for right at 24 volts.\nDon't run them at 24 volts\nif you're using those particular ones.\nHere again is,\nwe're using a P-channel power MOSFET\nas opposed to an N-channel.\nIt's wired differently, of course.\nWhat I have to do is,\nI'm using the detector and the MOSFET,\nand the optocoupler,\nto drop the gate voltage to about a half a volt\nwhen it switches on.\nAnd this will create a difference of around 10, 11 volts\nbetween gate and source.\nIt will switch on the transistor,\nand the light bulb will light up.\nThis goes right back to your basic transistor theory.\nHere is another variation of using an optocoupler.",
