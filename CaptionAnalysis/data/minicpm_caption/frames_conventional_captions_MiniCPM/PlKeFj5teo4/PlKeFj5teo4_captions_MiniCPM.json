It is used to control the aircraft's attitude, speed, and altitude. The FCL is composed of several components, including the gyroscope, accelerometer, and control surface magnetorheological actuators. The FCL uses a feedback loop to continuously adjust the control surface position in response to the aircraft's attitude and speed. This allows the aircraft to maintain a desired attitude and altitude, even in the presence of external disturbances such as wind or turbulence. The FCL is an essential component of modern aircraft, and its performance is critical to the safety and effectiveness of the aircraft."
