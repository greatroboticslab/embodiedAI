      "caption": "The image is a diagram illustrating the concept of state space for quadrotors. It starts with a figure of a quadrotor in motion, represented by a series of arrows. Each arrow is labeled with a variable, indicating the state of the quadrotor at a particular time. \n\nThe diagram is further divided into two main sections: the state space and the state vector. The state space is represented by a matrix, while the state vector is represented by a vector. \n\nThe state space is labeled as \"State Vector\" and the state vector is labeled as \"State Space\". The diagram also includes a set of equations that describe the dynamics of the quadrotor. These equations are labeled as \"Equilibrium at Hover\" and \"Plane Quadrator\".\n\nThe image also includes text that explains the concepts of state space and state vector. The text is written in a clear, legible font.\n\nOverall, the image provides a visual representation of the state space and state vector for quadrotors, along with the equations that describe their dynamics."
