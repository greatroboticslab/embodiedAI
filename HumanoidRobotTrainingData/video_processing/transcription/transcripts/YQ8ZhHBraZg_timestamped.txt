[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:17.000] We're going to talk about basic aerobatics and more advanced aerobatics with a quadcopter.
[00:00:17.000 → 00:00:20.000] We'll go ahead and start and get in the air.
[00:00:20.000 → 00:00:24.000] And first thing we're going to do is talk about doing a right or left roll.
[00:00:24.000 → 00:00:26.000] So that's going to be this direction on the aileron stick.
[00:00:26.000 → 00:00:32.000] And what we're going to do is as we roll, we're going to add throttle, we're going to roll,
[00:00:32.000 → 00:00:35.000] and then we're going to lower throttle and then catch with more throttle.
[00:00:35.000 → 00:00:39.000] So what I mean by that is this, add throttle, roll, catch with throttle.
[00:00:39.000 → 00:00:42.000] So if I don't do that, I'll get more of a wider roll.
[00:00:42.000 → 00:00:44.000] If I keep throttling, you see how it's a little wider.
[00:00:44.000 → 00:00:49.000] But if I pull throttle out, three, two, one, it's more of a linear roll
[00:00:49.000 → 00:00:51.000] and I don't get a lot of sideways action.
[00:00:51.000 → 00:00:54.000] Once again, add throttle, reduce throttle, add throttle.
[00:00:54.000 → 00:00:58.000] Now if we want to do a front flip or back flip, it's roughly the same thing.
[00:00:58.000 → 00:01:02.000] We add throttle, we go forward, and then we add more throttle at the bottom.
[00:01:02.000 → 00:01:03.000] So here we go.
[00:01:03.000 → 00:01:05.000] Add throttle, flip, add throttle.
[00:01:05.000 → 00:01:09.000] And once we do that flip, all we're doing is pushing forward and then letting go of the stick
[00:01:09.000 → 00:01:13.000] and coming back to the level and catching it with the cyclic stick and then adding throttle.
[00:01:13.000 → 00:01:17.000] So to do a little bit more advanced stuff, let's go ahead and do a loop.
[00:01:17.000 → 00:01:20.000] Now that we know how to do flips and rolls, we're going to go out here to the side.
[00:01:20.000 → 00:01:23.000] And I'm going to come towards us and just pull a loop.
[00:01:23.000 → 00:01:25.000] I'm just going to do a little baby loop here for us.
[00:01:25.000 → 00:01:31.000] I'm going to come towards us, add throttle, and keep pulling back on that elevator stick.
[00:01:31.000 → 00:01:33.000] I'm going to try it one more time when we back up.
[00:01:33.000 → 00:01:37.000] So we're going to add throttle to get speed, add throttle, pull back, and then come out of the bottom.
[00:01:37.000 → 00:01:40.000] That was kind of a short loop, but again, you can kind of get the idea.
[00:01:40.000 → 00:01:42.000] That's how you do a basic loop.
[00:01:42.000 → 00:01:46.000] One more time, adding throttle, pulling elevator all the way through, and then stopping.
[00:01:46.000 → 00:01:48.000] So we'll come back here to center.
[00:01:48.000 → 00:01:50.000] And now we'll kind of go ahead and just string stuff together.
[00:01:50.000 → 00:01:53.000] I'm going to go out and fly out and just have a good time, and I'll kind of talk through
[00:01:53.000 → 00:01:54.000] some of it.
[00:01:54.000 → 00:01:55.000] Here we go.
[00:01:55.000 → 00:01:57.000] So I'm doing some stuff.
[00:01:57.000 → 00:02:01.000] Right rolls, left rolls, flips.
[00:02:01.000 → 00:02:08.000] Go ahead and do traversing flips, pirouetting stuff.
[00:02:08.000 → 00:02:12.000] Getting a little far out here, but we'll do it.
[00:02:12.000 → 00:02:19.000] This is kind of the real basic aerobatics, kind of some stall turns.
[00:02:19.000 → 00:02:21.000] The pirouet on the bottom.
[00:02:21.000 → 00:02:23.000] Again, you can kind of see what my hands are doing here.
[00:02:23.000 → 00:02:27.000] Just adding slight inputs at a time, catching it with throttle.
[00:02:27.000 → 00:02:31.000] Again, it's not a helicopter, so it doesn't float.
[00:02:31.000 → 00:02:35.000] But reducing throttle is probably the biggest importance in aerobatics with quads so that you
[00:02:35.000 → 00:02:36.000] don't carry through.
[00:02:36.000 → 00:02:37.000] What I mean by that is this.
[00:02:37.000 → 00:02:42.000] If I go ahead and roll and add throttle, you see how it's a very aggressive snap roll.
[00:02:42.000 → 00:02:43.000] I'll try it again the other way here.
[00:02:43.000 → 00:02:44.000] It's really aggressive.
[00:02:44.000 → 00:02:49.000] You can still make it look cool, but you just don't, the quad just tends to not like it.
[00:02:49.000 → 00:02:50.000] But that's it guys.
[00:02:50.000 → 00:02:51.000] Basic aerobatics.
[00:02:51.000 → 00:02:52.000] Try different things.
[00:02:52.000 → 00:02:56.000] Slips, loops, rolls, add pirouettes if you can, and you'll start to become a pro pilot.
[00:02:56.000 → 00:02:57.000] Thanks for watching guys.
[00:02:57.000 → 00:02:58.000] See ya.
