[00:00:00.960 → 00:00:05.680] Hello and welcome to the Saturday Shot Tip episode and in today's video we are going to
[00:00:05.680 → 00:00:14.320] bind this FSIA6B receiver to the transmitter. So for this purpose you need an ESC and a battery
[00:00:14.320 → 00:00:22.240] to power the receiver and a bind key. The bind key actually activates the bind state of the
[00:00:22.240 → 00:00:33.840] receiver so you have to plug the bind key into the last port of the receiver that is actually B-VCC.
[00:00:33.840 → 00:00:41.600] It is actually used for input power and binding. The B represents the bind so you have to plug this
[00:00:42.160 → 00:00:52.080] key into the last port and then you just have to take the BEC wire of the ESC which is actually the
[00:00:52.080 → 00:01:00.080] to input power for to the receiver and plug it in any of the port of the receiver. Make sure that the
[00:01:00.640 → 00:01:09.120] the signal wire the white wire is towards the facing upwards upwards toward towards you. So and then
[00:01:09.120 → 00:01:19.360] lastly just plug the battery into the ESC. So the light in the receiver which will start blinking which
[00:01:19.360 → 00:01:28.000] actually represents that it is in bind mode. So now here come the turn of the transmitter and in
[00:01:28.000 → 00:01:34.640] transmitter you actually have got a bind key. Here it is written bind key. In some of the receiver for
[00:01:34.640 → 00:01:43.920] example FST6 the bind key is just at the back side of the transmitter. So before turning on the transmitter
[00:01:43.920 → 00:01:52.160] put all the switches up the throttle down and press the bind key and then turn on the transmitter. So it
[00:01:52.160 → 00:02:00.320] will show binding rx and it is bound and here it will show the voltage of the receiver which is 4.9 volts
[00:02:00.320 → 00:02:06.640] and the signal of the receiver and the light on the receiver will stop blinking which shows that the
[00:02:06.640 → 00:02:13.760] receiver is bound to the transmitter. About the bind key of the transmitter I actually carry my bind key in my
[00:02:13.920 → 00:02:24.800] keys. Actually I am mostly around the airplanes or receiver's binding so I keep it with me and my keys. You have these keys with your transmitter and
[00:02:26.240 → 00:02:31.840] it's your choice. So that's what that was all about today's video. Thank you and stay tuned.
