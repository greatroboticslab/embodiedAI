[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:02.200] Hey guys, welcome once again.
[00:00:03.080 → 00:00:06.040] This time we are going to check on bypass capacitors.
[00:00:06.580 → 00:00:11.240] In this video, we'll see why do we need bypass capacitors,
[00:00:12.020 → 00:00:14.180] how does a bypass capacitor work,
[00:00:14.860 → 00:00:17.520] which capacitors are best for this application,
[00:00:18.520 → 00:00:19.920] and how to select them.
[00:00:21.340 → 00:00:24.920] So buckle up guys, let's go for a ride.
[00:00:30.000 → 00:00:36.600] We use integrated circuits in electronic system,
[00:00:37.160 → 00:00:39.320] and they run on DC power supply.
[00:00:40.520 → 00:00:46.760] The performance of the ICs degrades if the input supply has some ripple or noise.
[00:00:47.320 → 00:00:49.140] If there is a digital IC,
[00:00:50.000 → 00:00:52.640] then the noise increases the clock jitter.
[00:00:53.680 → 00:00:55.800] In high-performance digital ICs,
[00:00:56.060 → 00:00:58.720] such as microprocessors and FPGAs,
[00:00:58.720 → 00:01:01.220] if this noise is present,
[00:01:01.640 → 00:01:04.500] then those will have very difficulties while working.
[00:01:05.380 → 00:01:10.780] Well, the traditional way to specify the sensitivity of an analog IC
[00:01:10.780 → 00:01:15.020] to power supply variation is the power supply rejection ratio.
[00:01:16.220 → 00:01:17.720] For an amplifier,
[00:01:18.180 → 00:01:22.780] power supply rejection ratio is the ratio of the change in output voltage
[00:01:22.780 → 00:01:24.700] to the change in power supply.
[00:01:24.700 → 00:01:30.660] Therefore, it is necessary to keep the high-frequency noise away from the chip.
[00:01:31.480 → 00:01:37.360] This is generally done with a combination of electrolytic capacitors and ceramic capacitors.
[00:01:37.360 → 00:01:42.480] Well, where does this noise come from?
[00:01:44.020 → 00:01:44.860] We already know,
[00:01:45.340 → 00:01:48.760] the electricity is nothing but the flow of electrons.
[00:01:49.480 → 00:01:52.960] These electrons flow all over the circuit through the ground plane.
[00:01:53.740 → 00:01:54.360] Unfortunately,
[00:01:54.960 → 00:01:57.420] this flow of electrons is not constant
[00:01:57.420 → 00:01:59.640] because of the PCB traces,
[00:02:00.120 → 00:02:00.660] wires,
[00:02:01.060 → 00:02:01.980] component pins,
[00:02:02.400 → 00:02:02.880] connectors,
[00:02:02.880 → 00:02:04.140] and cabling
[00:02:04.140 → 00:02:06.820] on which the electronic circuit works.
[00:02:08.200 → 00:02:12.360] These all things possess some parasitic inductance and resistance.
[00:02:12.360 → 00:02:15.740] The value of this is very small,
[00:02:15.740 → 00:02:17.640] but if we add it up all,
[00:02:18.300 → 00:02:21.340] this value is big enough to affect the flow of current.
[00:02:22.160 → 00:02:25.020] Inductors resist the change in the current flow,
[00:02:25.520 → 00:02:29.640] so this gets worse as the frequency of a signal increases.
[00:02:31.080 → 00:02:34.880] The microcontroller unit provides the signal to various loads.
[00:02:34.880 → 00:02:38.440] These loads consume power dynamically,
[00:02:39.160 → 00:02:41.120] which give rise to current spikes.
[00:02:41.540 → 00:02:41.700] So,
[00:02:41.840 → 00:02:47.440] these factors affect the power supply line and generate spikes even in DC power supply.
[00:02:47.920 → 00:02:50.240] And it is called as electrical noise.
[00:02:51.520 → 00:02:52.540] But in this case,
[00:02:52.760 → 00:02:56.220] we have considered only the electronic system itself.
[00:02:56.560 → 00:02:57.540] But in real world,
[00:02:57.920 → 00:03:03.200] there are tons of other devices which work simultaneously with the electronic system.
[00:03:03.200 → 00:03:03.960] So,
[00:03:03.960 → 00:03:10.560] the electrical noise is also radiated from magnetically induced currents from other systems,
[00:03:11.360 → 00:03:13.760] also from nearby mechanical vibrations,
[00:03:14.400 → 00:03:16.160] and there are so many factors.
[00:03:16.960 → 00:03:20.320] These noise can be very devastating for digital ICs.
[00:03:22.640 → 00:03:22.880] Now,
[00:03:22.880 → 00:03:24.160] next question comes,
[00:03:24.720 → 00:03:27.200] how does a small capacitor solve this problem?
[00:03:29.040 → 00:03:32.880] The noise which is affecting the power supply is in AC form.
[00:03:33.200 → 00:03:37.760] A capacitor behaves like an open circuit at DC voltages,
[00:03:38.160 → 00:03:42.400] and if there is an AC component in the signals traveling in the circuit,
[00:03:42.880 → 00:03:48.720] capacitors begin to act like a short circuit and don't let this noise enter in the digital device.
[00:03:49.840 → 00:03:50.800] At the same time,
[00:03:51.040 → 00:03:53.360] it charges up to its maximum level.
[00:03:53.360 → 00:03:58.560] When the digital IC is switching and providing some signals to the loads,
[00:03:59.120 → 00:04:02.400] then it needs remarkable amount of current immediately.
[00:04:02.640 → 00:04:06.160] So, the capacitor provides that reserved energy right away.
[00:04:07.360 → 00:04:12.560] A capacitor is placed in the circuit where it will suppress or bypass signals.
[00:04:12.560 → 00:04:17.280] So, these capacitors are connected in parallel with the ICs.
[00:04:17.920 → 00:04:22.880] The bypass capacitors are also known as decoupling capacitors.
[00:04:23.760 → 00:04:26.240] They act as a frequency-dependent resistor.
[00:04:27.040 → 00:04:32.960] Noise through the power lines is completely unpredictable and changes in nature every time.
[00:04:32.960 → 00:04:39.520] The capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the ICs.
[00:04:40.320 → 00:04:45.920] If these are placed farther away from the power or crown pins of the IC,
[00:04:45.920 → 00:04:50.800] then it will also result in unwanted inductance and resistance in the path.
[00:04:50.800 → 00:04:59.440] The closer to the load a capacitor is placed, the more amount of noise is bypassed by this capacitor.
[00:05:00.160 → 00:05:10.160] If the frequency of the noise is less than 50 MHz, then a capacitor of value around 0.1uF or 10uF is
[00:05:10.160 → 00:05:17.520] sufficient. At frequencies approaching above 50 MHz, we may need multiple bypass capacitors.
[00:05:17.520 → 00:05:27.440] But, this frequency of the noise is very unpredictable. So, connecting multiple capacitors in parallel is the best practice.
[00:05:29.280 → 00:05:33.600] But, which capacitors are best suited for bypassing the noise?
[00:05:34.400 → 00:05:39.360] There are so many guidelines to consider while selecting a bypass capacitor.
[00:05:40.160 → 00:05:44.880] A large electrolytic capacitor can be used if there is low frequency noise.
[00:05:44.880 → 00:06:03.120] The capacitors will need to provide current very quickly.
[00:06:04.160 → 00:06:11.280] The first and most important aspect is to choose capacitors which has low equivalent series resistance.
[00:06:11.280 → 00:06:16.080] The ceramic capacitors have low ESR.
[00:06:17.120 → 00:06:24.800] So, typically, ceramic capacitors are used for decoupling application due to their wide temperature
[00:06:24.800 → 00:06:32.720] tolerance, ability to withstand wide voltage ranges, low ESR, good stability and reliability.
[00:06:32.720 → 00:06:42.560] So, the package and size of the capacitor also plays a very important role while selecting a bypass capacitor.
[00:06:43.760 → 00:06:50.560] Because, when you see a capacitor, it has little inductance and resistance which are known as equivalent
[00:06:50.560 → 00:06:59.440] series resistance and equivalent series inductance. So, overall, a capacitor has an impedance of XE,
[00:06:59.440 → 00:07:04.560] XE, and resistance. And these impedances are like this.
[00:07:07.280 → 00:07:14.800] So, as the frequency increases, the XE of the capacitor decreases. So, total impedance of the capacitor
[00:07:14.800 → 00:07:23.200] decreases. And as frequency increases, the XE increases. Hence, total impedance also increases.
[00:07:23.200 → 00:07:31.840] But there is a region where the impedance of the capacitor is very low. And that frequency is known as
[00:07:31.840 → 00:07:39.040] resonance frequency. A small impedance is present due to equivalent series resistance of the capacitor.
[00:07:40.240 → 00:07:46.400] This resonance frequency can be different for different packages of the same capacitor value as well.
[00:07:46.400 → 00:07:54.640] So, generally, the engineers put different size and different values. So, we should select a capacitor
[00:07:55.280 → 00:08:02.960] which will have lower impedance at the frequency of the noise. Well, it's a tedious process. But we get
[00:08:02.960 → 00:08:10.880] precise noise suppression out of the decoupling capacitor. So, now you can select a decoupling capacitor for your
[00:08:10.880 → 00:08:22.800] ices. And that's it for now. If you have any questions, let me know in the comment section. Hit the like button if you like this video,
