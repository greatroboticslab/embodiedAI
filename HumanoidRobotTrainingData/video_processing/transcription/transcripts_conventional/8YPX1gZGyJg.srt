Hey folks, welcome to another video.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,840
Today I will show you how to discharge a capacitor safely and quickly.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,840
The capacitors are found in all devices, from microwaves to computers in cars.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,360
Before working with any device, it is necessary to empty the capacitors.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,180
This is done very quickly in a safe way.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,920
As an electrical engineer, I have often seen how people empty their capacitors in the wrong way,

8
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,500
and, in the process, are shocked by the sparks and the mini explosion that happens.

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,160
I will explain to you step by step how to discharge the capacitors very easily and safely.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,980
It is necessary to use protection when discharging the capacitor.

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,040
You need insulated gloves to protect you from accidental contact with metal through which electricity passes.

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,280
It is also required to use goggles preventively if sparks occur.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,820
Capacitors are like mini-bases for power transmission.

14
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,800
They store electricity in themselves and filter specific signals,

15
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,820
and further forward the current signals needed for the operation of the circuit.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,640
And they keep the rest of the electricity inside.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,040
Depending on the capacitance, the capacitor can store more or less current.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,260
The capacitor unit is a farad.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,800
Farad is a huge unit, so it is used pico, nano, and microfarad.

20
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,000
The operating voltage is also marked on the capacitor.

21
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,580
If you want to replace the capacitor, you need to put one with the same values.

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,540
You cannot set a lower or higher value of the capacitor than the same.

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,880
The capacitor also has two pins on the sides marked with two signs, one plus and one minus.

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,180
That way, you will know which foot goes to which side in the electrical circuit.

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,280
Connecting the wrong capacitor will destroy your capacitor and may damage the drudge elements in the circuit.

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,860
Never touch or do anything with the appliance or capacitor while it is plugged in.

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,120
The first thing you need to do is turn off the power.

28
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,520
This will make you safer and more secure when you discharge the capacitor.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:16,240
You need three things, insulated gloves, glasses, and a discharge pen.

30
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,500
A discharge pen is one perfect device that is not expensive at all.

31
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,040
Which will safely discharge the capacitor without sparks and electric shock.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
The discharge pen drew current from the capacitor, passed it with great resistance, and discharged your capacitor.

33
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,220
Now connect those two strokes to the discharge pen.

34
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,580
Be sure to join the ends well and wait a few seconds.

35
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,640
Then remove the discharge pen.

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,380
Your capacitor is empty.

37
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,900
This method is hazardous.

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,500
You can make sparks or electric shocks.

39
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,100
You need to use goggles, insulated gloves, and an insulated screwdriver.

40
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,980
Suppose there is a capacitor on the board.

41
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,380
In that case, I do not recommend using this method,

42
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,600
because you can touch a power line and damage the drudge elements in the circuit.

43
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,560
Connect the legs of the condenser to the screwdriver,

44
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,700
so that they both touch the metal part of the screwdriver.

45
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,820
Do it a couple of times quickly.

46
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,480
You may see sparks or a small explosion.

47
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,720
Yes, it's possible.

48
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,880
In time to drain the capacitor.

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,140
From a long time of non-use.

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,480
If it is not connected to a battery or other power source.

51
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,620
Very simply connect a capacitor to the battery source.

52
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,100
If you connect to 3 volts, it charges to 3 volts.

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,300
If you connect to 9, you charge it with 9 volts, and so on.

54
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,560
The multimeter can also charge it.

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,920
Now you will see how to check the correctness of the capacitor.

56
00:03:46,200 --> 00:04:01,500
Come on in now.

57
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:31,480
Thank you.

58
00:04:31,500 --> 00:05:01,480
Thank you.

59
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:31,480
Thank you.
