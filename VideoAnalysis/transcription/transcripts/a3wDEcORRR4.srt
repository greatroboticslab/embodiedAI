1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
Now let's take a look at how we can go from something like this fairly robust breadboard

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,520
with nice cleaned up wires to something even more robust, something that we can implement,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,940
say, in a robot that's moving around or on your bicycle or in a car or an industrial application

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:18,880
or something, or just the fact that you want to pass it around and let people play with this

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,340
prototype, right? These wires can get loose eventually, they corrode, they make misconnections,

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:29,300
it's just not the best long-term solution. So what we use is PerfBoard, and PerfBoard is perforated

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:37,060
board that you cut to whatever size you want, and you hardwire solder all those connections in place.

8
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,940
There's lots of different kind. This one is like a single point PerfBoard. Some of them have

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,580
rows that are all connected, similar to like a breadboard and how that's connected.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,320
I like these, they're one-sided, and they have individual copper pads on each hole, and I'll show

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:56,900
you briefly how I would use it. This video is more about some tips and techniques more than actually

12
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:01,320
building something on a PerfBoard. It's fairly straightforward, but I've got some things that

13
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,460
should help you build it. Number one, size. Don't necessarily want this size of a PerfBoard.

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,700
I want something smaller. Maybe I'm creating a little board that breaks out all the analog pins

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,960
here of my Arduino. It'd be just so much easier to have a PerfBoard that could plug into there,

16
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,720
or have breakout header pins or something. So cutting it, cutting it. You can use little nippers,

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,080
you can use some scissors. Don't bother. I see lots of people doing that. You get jagged edges.

18
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,560
It's not the best way. Best thing you can do, go get some really cheap tin snips. Make sure you buy

19
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,840
whether you buy a right-handed or left-handed version. But look at this. If I were to take

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,020
this PerfBoard, or actually I have one here cut down already, and I were to just cut a row off of this,

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,420
I mean it cuts so easily. It leaves a nice clean edge, very little sharp corners. I mean it's just,

22
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:54,120
it's really nice. And if I wanted, say, a little breakout board from my Arduino, I can actually

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,240
just cut the board like that. And look at that. I've got this great little breakout board that I

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,220
could solder some header pins in and put it on my Arduino. Couldn't really be easier. So that's

25
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:12,040
number one, cutting. Number two, soldering. So if you're going to put a integrated circuit into your

26
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,220
board, you can solder it right to the PerfBoard, but trust me on this. And I've done it. Sadly,

27
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,880
I've done it. I still actually remember one time I was making an Arduino many, many years ago. I want

28
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,560
to say like close to 10 years ago. And I soldered my AT Mega, I don't remember, I think it was a 168

29
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:35,820
microcontroller in there. And I fried it. And once I soldered it in, I go to unsolder it. It was a mess.

30
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,960
It was horrible. Don't put your microcontrollers or integrated circuits, don't solder them directly to

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,520
a board. Use something like a socket. And this is a socket. And what this allows you to do is put it

32
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,960
into PerfBoard, solder this in from the backside. And then I can take my microcontroller and I can

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,980
snap it into the socket. Something happens, I can pop it out. If I change my code, I can actually have

34
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,240
on the side a couple of different microcontrollers with different codes. It's really great for demoing.

35
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:07,220
It's great for having a backup. So that's one thing. Another thing to know is when soldering to

36
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:12,760
the PerfBoard, and I'll grab my soldering iron real quick to show you. And you know what, I'm going to

37
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:19,860
make a quick note about this soldering iron. This is my used industrial grade MetCal soldering iron.

38
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,980
Why do I use this? This uses these RF tips. It's basically like a radio antenna, believe it or not,

39
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:34,980
that from my understanding excites the tip of the soldering iron and heats it up extremely fast. I love

40
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,360
this soldering iron. They're hundreds of dollars new, but you can go to eBay and buy them used for,

41
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,440
I think I paid under a hundred bucks for this. And what I like about it is if I go to turn it on,

42
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,240
I've just turned my soldering iron on.

43
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:56,580
And let these little brass there, let's see. There you go. It's already up to temperature.

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,060
I mean, what was that? A couple of seconds? Love it. It actually cools down just as fast.

45
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,080
But what I wanted to show you is let's say we were going to solder this header pin in here.

46
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,060
I push it through from this side.

47
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,900
And I can get in here and get a nice little blob of solder on my soldering iron.

48
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,080
I can tack it in place real quick.

49
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,720
And now that's tacked in place, right? But this is what I wanted to get at.

50
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,440
When working with PerfBoard, these are incredibly valuable.

51
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:37,520
This is a rosin flux pen. And what this does is it cleans and is a facilitator for the solder to flow.

52
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,400
So if I'm going to go in here, you can see the PerfBoards typically are a little,

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,960
I don't want to say messy, but they're not exactly the cleanest of all things.

54
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:50,600
And with a little flux pen, it makes soldering so much easier.

55
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,860
Trust me on this one. You want a pen

56
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,320
like this. This is a

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,800
rosin flux pen by

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,720
MG Chemicals. These are really

59
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,580
handy to have. They're also really good when you're reworking solder joints.

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Paint over it with some of the flux

61
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,500
and you will desolder much easier.

62
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,220
So there's another tip. There I got my header pins in here.

63
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,220
Last but not least, I want to also mention that

64
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,020
if you are going to

65
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,860
solder a bunch of things together,

66
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,400
like let's say you needed a whole bunch of pins connected along a bar.

67
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,420
I've mentioned earlier in videos, I saved these little

68
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,060
clips from my LEDs and I'll usually have a few on hand.

69
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,260
These can be very handy when soldering on a PerfBoard.

70
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,260
Again, I can flux this

71
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,960
and say I wanted to connect all these pins together.

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,000
I can quickly take my

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,520
little lead that I have here.

74
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,520
I can temporarily put it right there

75
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,160
and then I can bend it like that

76
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,600
and I can actually go in and connect all these points.

77
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,860
Sometimes you just need a lot of points connected together.

78
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,300
See how quickly I can flood that?

79
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,340
Look at that.

80
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,580
Beautiful bar of solder.

81
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,020
So, you know, imagine I had all different breakout wires

82
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,340
that I want to connect on the other side.

83
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,260
That's a really simple way of doing it.

84
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,680
Wires are connected the same way.

85
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
You know, I like to use these little

86
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,020
flush cutters.

87
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,120
I just put the wire in on the front.

88
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,780
There's my wire on the back

89
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,740
and I can easily just go in there

90
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,460
and solder it

91
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,880
right where it needs to be.

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:34,580
Done.

93
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
A little bit of a cold solder joint

94
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,300
but don't worry about it.

95
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,080
Another very useful thing

96
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,680
is make sure you trim these leads down.

97
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,160
Get them real nice and short

98
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,880
and close to the board.

99
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,700
So that's basically how you build

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,940
on a PerfBoard.

101
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,400
Now, there's all different kinds.

102
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Some of them have built-in rows.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,700
Some of them look just like breadboards

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,440
and that's the last thing I want to show you.

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,360
I'm a big fan of these.

106
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,740
These are called the perma-proto boards.

107
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,120
And what I like about these

108
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,320
is if you look very carefully,

109
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,100
each one of these holes is connected already

110
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,000
just like it would be on a breadboard.

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,800
And if you're building this circuit,

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,460
I can buy a perma-proto board.

113
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,860
That's a half-size breadboard.

114
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,940
This happens to be a quarter size that I have here.

115
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,260
But I can literally just hold this right here

116
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,600
and build the same circuit,

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,820
wire it up the same way as my breadboard,

118
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,660
flip it over, solder it together,

119
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,860
and it works perfectly.

120
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,220
These are extremely handy.

121
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,400
They're quite affordable.

122
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,200
And to be quite honest with you,

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,260
if you're building a prototype,

124
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,860
they're really slick looking.

125
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,460
So that's about it for building on a PerfBoard.

126
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,340
I hope those tips and tricks help you a little bit

127
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,620
and ease that learning curve.
