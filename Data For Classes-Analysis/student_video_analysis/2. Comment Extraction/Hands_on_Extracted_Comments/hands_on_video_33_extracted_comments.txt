have a question about the yellow-capped component labeled "PW" on the motor shield. Additionally, I've developed a car using the same procedure and utilizing two 3.7V batteries each. However, I've encountered two problems:  1- When I unplug the USB, the car stops working. 2- The batteries seem unable to power all four motors to move the car. Initially, the setup worked fine during testing, but these issues arose later on. Could you please provide assistance on how to address these problems?  and what specific Batteries and how many of them I need and what volatge.Thanks In adavnce.

@RitaKumari-zt3hj  It can be because of any kind of coding error or crossed wire connections..check them..

He is right program not uploading Error avrdude

⁠ @pragyadwivedi5182  Hello, I'm in a hurry right now. Can I ask you a question? Can I use the Bluetooth module HC-06 instead? Only the voice control function will be used.😢😢

@user-be4wi7gx1h  Yes, the HC-06 Bluetooth module can be used for voice control commands with Arduino. You can connect the HC-06 module to the Arduino's serial communication pins (Rx and Tx) and use a separate module or smartphone with voice recognition capabilities to send commands wirelessly to the Arduino. Keep in mind that you might need additional components or software to process and interpret voice commands on the Arduino side.

@pragyadwivedi5182  Thank you so much!! I feel relieved🥹 Can I ask you a question one more time?? Why remove the Rx,Tx jupmers before uploding the code??

@pragyadwivedi5182   Is it because I use the hc-06 Bluetooth module instead of the hc-05 that I need additional?

@user-be4wi7gx1h  It's important to remove because rx is the reciever and tx is transmit you can't recieve data from two reciever(the one u using to upload the code) so u need to remove one reciever to upload the code in arduino..

​​ @pragyadwivedi5182 bro can you please give me your contact or WhatsApp number I'm planning to make it and I'm new in coding part please can you help me humble request 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Is it ok to use in 2 wheels only?

I did the exact same one as yours, but only maximum two wheels can be motivated by motor at once. I can't figure out why, if anyone can provide some useful solutions? Thanks a lot.

Please explain me how did you calculate how many batteries you need🙏

i have a doubght  can all theree functions run Simultaneously

Where links

We can use other motor instead of gear motor ?

Sir the app for Bluetooth control does not work on new model of Android can u suggest some other app

Bro where is the code please provide fast please

Please upload Arduino code

Total 2000

Srituhobby app

Yes of cos it very possible but if you are using two wheel control u will need a third wheel it like a small ball that will be placed at the front to easily rotate

It either your battery capacity cannot move the four motors at once or your motor connection are wrong, or the other two outlet for the motors are damaged. To know if it damage try testing another motors there. And also recheck your connections

​ @Vlight. Sir, i made this project but now coding is issue how can i connect it? Do help me aabd guide me

Hello, I am having a problem with the code for obstacle avoidance. Basically after uploading the code for obstacle avoidance the car is not using the ultrasonic sensor continuously but at some interval of time. During this interval  if the car was moving forward it would move forward even if gets collided with an obstacle. I haven't altered the code but just commented out the bluetooth and voice control functions (which when uploaded works absolutely fine). Please reply asap as I have to submit this project for my acads.

Reply my question sir , battery not working, blutooth or obstacle only working when i connect usb

AFmotor.h no such file, what's problem

Sir code error aara h kya krun

Awesome. but how to make this product to avoid obstacles while using voice command as well as bluetooth?

Not working obstacle and blutooth when i on switch, but it's work when usb connect to computer.. please solve the problem

Aapne ye program kisme se operate kiya hai please batavo na

Not working, Bluetooth or voice control please solve 🥺

Bro its  go straight how many distance

my controller app is not connecting with the bluetooth module  it connect but within 5 sec it got disconnected ?? Why?

Bro.. I have given all the connections correctly. my ultrasonic sensor is working properly.but,the wheels are not moving.and Bluetooth also connected but wheels are not is any problem with code or motor driver problem..

Where i the code can u plz give me

Bro can you give code please 👏

Kitne rupees ka total investment kiya h

هل يمكنني استخدام bluetooth module HC-06 بدلا من HC-05

Where can we get the code

Hello actually i was facing  a problem in uploading the code it is verified but shows error in upload would be helpfil if you have any solution

This is just an idea to get your own project started. If you can't figure out what is the issue maybe this career is not for you. Be a lawyer or a cook instead.

If the ultrasonic did not work well it either you didn't include the newping library for the ultrasonic or the battery is weak, most times if the battery or power is weak some of the sensors don't work well because the Arduino will not be stable

Please provide me the source code, link in the description box is not working

What is the code

good work if you add auto stop sensors using while an object to hit, it will automatically stop it perfect. just I think so

Thank you so much, I had a science fair and I did this project and my teachers are obsessed with it

can you to show me all the code

Mind blowing project bro but my doubt is to recharge the battery i need to take it out or I can do it in ite Arduino board

Ya

Bro am unable to run the car....all connections are made...can u help me please

@SGECAishwaryaKM  it's been over a year since i done my project, so i forgot pretty much every, my advice for u is to try simple systems, to make sure ur wiring and components and codes are working, then try to combine simple systems and codes or simple functions, other than that u'll be overwhelmed and lost, start small and build on that, look for every module or sensor online to get a code or a wiring diagram as a reference, One more thing, if ur system is a bit complicated, don't rely too much on chat Gbt, 70% of the time hr provides wrong codes, i hope this helps, good luck

srituhobby.com

Can you please provide me the source code cz link in the description box isn't working anymore

Form board

Please use our website. srituhobby.com

srituhobby.com

It dependa on your location

i think you can use male to female jumper wire then do soldring

@aijazahmadreshi5822  Actually it's is one way but the real way to do it is that you have to get BERGS pins then solder it on to the hard driver then it will work.

Please use our website. srituhobby.com

Yah..But It's complicated

@sritu_hobby  can you explain shortly please..

What complicated, will it work or not, can we switch modes without coding each time. Like we can start other two mode from RC mode only please tell​ @sritu_hobby

It's only DIY

How much cost?

Yes how much is it worth?

Did it work or not ?? Please tell I also have to make it for my school exhibition will it definitely work ,?

Ok sure

Which Program did u use??

Sir code dalna sikha do

Hi, I wanted to ask that does motor driver light blink and Arduino light when connected to PC.

Bro please help me i have made it according to you but when i try upload the program the servo motor rotates continually please help anyone

Amazing project 😀❤️❤️

Amazing project thanks ! We made the same project like you and we following all the steps everything is good but we need to add another program to this one we need to display distance measure in a smartphone  application like remotexy or RoboRemoFree - Control Arduino, ESP8266 and others   Can you help us please we need your hepl please 🙏🙏🙏

Please do you have the simulation for this?

I was able to compile the code with no errors. I connected the Rx pin on the Bluetooth module to 1 and the tx pin to 0. Connected the ultrasonic sensor the same way you did yours. I am using a 4x AA battery which has 1.5volts each making it a total of 6 volts. After uploading the code, I removed the cable and put in the batteries. Only the front right tire spun. The rest weren't moving. After a while, the front right tire stopped moving as well and the back right tire started to move.  This stopped shortly after. What may be the problem, please?

Bro can you make one separate video on to to kept programme code in arduino please I always whatch all your videos

source code link is not working

you can visit srituhobby.com

Plz tell the codes

Plz tell the codes

Im using li-ion battery chager.

I was able to do it! I replace the forward(); by Obstacle(); on the if else statements. Thanks! Great work !!

Hey can you please help me in making this project I'm using Arduino mega all thing is done correctly but motor is not moving so what to do now ?

@expensive6797  Check the battery power..it may low

Please check the program

Thanks

​Where is software link 🔗 please send

No, I haven't it.

Also, my servo motor is MG90S. Just stating incase that might be a problem

Please use a 9v battery.

@sritu_hobby  you have no idea how happy I am to receive a reply from you. I had just gone to the market already and I’ve just gotten the 9v battery. I hope it won’t be too much for the car. I am on a deadline and I’m so scared. Is there any platform I can privately contact you please? 🙌🏻😔 whatsapp, whatever please

@sritu_hobby  Also, I just plugged a dc cable to test it first. Only the back left tire was moving and, it was rotating  backwards . Please, I really need help

@sritu_hobby  I used 9 volt battery but the wheels are getting very slow and stopping not moving at all I have used 200rpm bo motor please help

Please use a li-ion batteries

@sritu_hobby  ok sir

I have this project and my wheels are going backward only.. I have deadline on this sunday and I Don't know what to do..help me please

@streamingsanjida  try changing the wiring of the motors to motor driver or look for it in the code

@streamingsanjida   try interchanging the wires. That should work. The alternative would be the command in your code

Bro I need all the functions in one code

which coding language do you used?

Did you have any problem by using 9 volt battery

​ @sritu_hobby  i am using 4 9 volt battery but it is still not working is there any solution

Sure.I will make it

Please try again.

Can I do the transfer with com 5 com 2 is not there in option... Please help

Congratulations, this is the first multi-command project I've seen, very creative.🇧🇷

Bro one doubt you had done three programming in this video we can do all three of this and use bluthooth voice control and obstacle avoiding at the same time

Can I add all Bluetooth obstacle  avoiding and voice commands at the same time

Hey sir again sorry for taking your time but I want to ask we use hc-05 Bluetooth module for coding Arduino instead of usb cable do we have to make some changes?

how much mah are the batteries?

Iski coding video

Bro can we make voice control camera and dancing carrr

What was the total cost sir

💗💗💗First of all ,  Amazing Project and thank you for all of your hard work for provoding every resources , codes and   plus the  Sri Tu Hobby  App is amazing with lots of good things . My doubt is   can we run all three codes at same time?   will voice control + bluetooth + obstacle avoiding  will work at same time or    it works one  function at a time?  Can you please help me .💗💗💗

Please can you send the code

Hi can u say how much does it cost for all the components approx offline or online

Bro tino commands ek hi saath bhi de sakte hai na

Bhai cods khud banana padta hai ya ata hai

Is we have to delete obstacle avoiding program to upload nxt bluetooth control program????

Dıd you remove the jumper from motor sheild

Which jumper wire should we use whether male to female or male to male or female to female

My Moter driver Is Not Working But Servo Moter is working only 4 moters Is Not Working, Plzz Reply

Can I use L298 motor driver

Can u please provide Project Report of this...

It depends on your computer. Please select the correct COM port.

Thank you very much!

thank you

Ig people of Brazil are very interested in robotics I see so much people of Brazil in every comment of any robot video

Can we use any other mah battery

Yah

@sritu_hobby  you

@sritu_hobby  you

@staceycezzainesolis191 were you able to upload the code

​ @sritu_hobby  can't all three mode will run at a time like if we want to use voice control while it work as obstacle avoider

​ @sritu_hobby 9:24

@PriyanshuRaj-qn8ix  i have that same doubt

​ @sritu_hobby sir help me Mai Ye project bna rhi hu but error aa rha h Bluetooth salas hata rhi hu to

Plzzzz how to upload the Arduino code help me brooo🇳🇵

It's not multi program

You can try it

You can try it.

@sritu_hobby  BRO CAN WE USE ALL CODSES TOGETHER MEANS OBSTACLE AND VOICE COMMAND AND BLUETOOTH ALL TOGETHER

I will upload that video.

@sritu_hobby  bro upload it faster

@sritu_hobby  bro but can we combine all three codes. It is possible or not

@sritu_hobby  also your code is not working. It shows error that forward is not in scope

Pls help

Yes of course

@sritu_hobby  sir pls tell I have connect all battery source still my car doesn't work. What's the problem I have to make submission tomorrow

@sritu_hobby  bro when I run your code open only Obstacle function. Only servo motor is running rest no dc motor is running

It is just wasteful of time and you might burn the shield

4800 mAh in one battery

Please visit the video description

Sure, you can try it

Cause bro we choosed voice control car bt sir told us covert that car into voice control camera car

Please visit the video description.

.I will be doing that project soon.

​ @sritu_hobby  have you done this project yet. i want to do this but i need it to be able to run all three states at the same time

​ @sritu_hobby have you done, if yes then can you please provide updated code link

@sritu_hobby  update?

Please visit the video description.

You can calculate that value using parts list. Please visit the video description.

English??

We can code for three of the commands simultaneously

We can control it by removing the slash of the three commands

These are working one by one.

English???

Sir i say that cods have to be made this

or get

You can make it.

How

No bro.

Female to Female

Sure, but you have to change code and connections.

Can you change and send it?

Is L393D motor driver works on this code but not shield

I have made a same project . I am using a 9 V Battery and it is not working. It works fine with 12 V adapter

how can i see your code that you used

Brother, I have made a car but I can't give the setting.

sir could I use another motor driver

Brother, the previous code link is not working, please give me the code. It is very important to me.

Hi Bro, again components are refixed properly.but Problem not sold,can you help me.

Bro can i use 3 things at same time

Hi Bro. Code uploading not completed and Compiling sketch code taking long time.

I am having one more doubt how much jumper wires you need to make a single robot?

Which application you use to activate voice command

Can we use the same connections if the L293d is missing the pins ??

Bro awesome video!!, I have one doubt, Can we use 9v battery?? and how to convert it to 2wd?

Sar yah 3 functions Ek Sath work kar sakte hain

Can I use Arduino nano

my hc-05 stop blinking after working once  i dont know the reason can u tell me plzz i have done this yestarday it have bein working nyt bt morning when i switched on its not moving wat can i do plzz help me i have to submit it on friday plz do reply mee

Bro I have followed the steps bt it's not responding to my voice commands plzz reply me I have my submission on wednesday means 30 June plzzz plzzz help me 😭😭

What do we have to do in the code to make it all work together or just voice with obstacle help me if you can bro i need that

What price you can sell this robot I am interested to buy this

Your welcome

What shield?

@sritu_hobby  only motor driver not shield

Sure, the 9v battery power is not enough this project. Actually, 12v is perfect this project. I also provide 12v power using my bench power supply. Thank you

@sritu_hobby  thanks ,I got that

Your welcome

Code link in the description.Otherwise go to the srituhobby website

Please visit the video and website..All link in the description

Yes, you can use..but you want to change the code.

sir please help me how i can change the code

https://srituhobby.com

Check your code

Plssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss reply

This project is can't use for that..

What is 3 things?

Obstacle avoiding + Bluetooth control

Aur I have to every time change the code

Connect the bluetooth module for this project

Ok

@sritu_hobby  Hai can u plzz help me in this project

What is you issue?

@sritu_hobby  can I get algorithm of this one ?

@sritu_hobby  And it can be used without applying coding every time for 3functions?

Visit the video description

It is your issu..check again your components and program

Hi bro, again I'm tired same problem facing, can you help me.

Its depend on project.

Bluetooth control app in the playstore

It is really a cool video broo

@sritu_hobby  thanks for replying fast

@sritu_hobby  I don't understand. Why should I check  the codes part?? It's only related to the connections right?? I don't understand

@Samiran Medhi So can we do the connections with the L293d without the pins?

@Samiran Medhi ok

Hello what's the solution for this problem

@nikhiljakkani9  we have to solder the pins which i found risky

@sritu_hobby  Thank you so much for replying so quickly!! and how to convert it to 2wd?

I am sure u give more than 3.3vol to h05 bluetooth module. It was dead buy a new one

Can I use   one  3.7 volt 3000 mah laptop battery

Sure, you will

@darkshadow57899  u can use

Yes,sure

I want to do make this car for my college project , i want to ask  when i make this car  then working or not

@preetikumari7965   s it works definetly but if u do all the connections correctly which college

I have used the same programm

I want voice controlled and obstacle avoidance through Bluetooth

Plzz help me

Hwy did u sort it out ?

Deez Nuts

Will All the functions work together if we merge the codes. What I mean is can we run all three Codes in order to function All the three

Thanks Very Much

How much is the Arduino Uno

Good video!! Super channel

Bro please put Arduino Nano basic projects

👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌

Hey actually I to have a same doubt did u sort it out ?

Mee to same doubt

No bro it dont work at same time

@syedkhalid5584  not working at same time
