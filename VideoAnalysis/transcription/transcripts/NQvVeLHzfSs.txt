All right here is a mock-up of an H-Bridge motor control. It is an improved version of one that I published nearly a decade ago. I'll discuss briefly what the improvements are and while I'm just using a set of tactile switches that is a 24 volt I think 3 amp motor on 24 volts and I'm controlling it with a pair of little low-power tactile switches. All right here's my schematic for the H-Bridge I demonstrated at the beginning of the video. Here's just the two little tactile switches. I have four MOSFETs, four resistors, and two Zener diodes. This has been tested to operate as is from 5 to 24 volts. U1 and U3 are P-channel MOSFETs I used at IRF4905. U2 and U4 are IRFC44N. These are sensitive gate MOSFETs unlike my original design that used some lower quality P-channel transistors that used to get hot. I ran that motor at a couple of amps and I didn't even heat sync the transistors. So this is going to be a starting point. By the way the 6.2 volt Zener's are to protect the gate circuit of U1 and U3 because I'm using more than 20 volts. All right and so this will be the basis of several more circuits that are up and coming. Be sure to visit my website at www.bristolwatch.com you
