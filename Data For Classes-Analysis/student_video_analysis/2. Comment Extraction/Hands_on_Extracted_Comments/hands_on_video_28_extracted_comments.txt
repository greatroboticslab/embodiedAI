hi, i was looking up the code and it is running fine, but im unable to update the encoder value as it shows 0 0 , even if i try to rotate it manually . maybe , the connection could be different for signal pins and vcc - gnd pins of encoder thus couldnt read i guess , but i tried out with different code with my current pin configuration , it was working . pin -  M- M+ E(VCC) E(GND)  E(s1) E(S2), this is what my current pin configuraiton. what could be the issue here ?

Isn't "driver software" the "comms layer"?

Hello, great video I learned a lot, thank you! A question, can I replace the arduino by the Raspberry Pico? What should I do about it?

Great video!

it appears you have an issue with your right eye... please get that checked out?

Liked and subscribed.

1:27 i need video about how to choose motors for different purpose and also different types of motor @articulaterobotics

Have you tried with a BLDC motor equipped with a Hall sensor?

I'm getting in error #include WProgram.h while compiling in arudino.... Could you help me to fix this sir

Please, can you send the link of the video of uploading the code on to the Arduino ? I didn’t find it in the description as you said

Where did you get the blue work mat?

you forgot torque-speed relation, bearing friction and the torque required to overcome it, max torque, max continuous torque, gear boxes, and stall current

hi! what if i want to make a robot that is completely disconnected from my arduino UNO and can self run. Basically I upload some preset direction code and take it off the arduino UNO then run it. Is this possible with these motors ?

Amazing video, really well explained.  Im having an issue with only the pins connected to D2 and D3 are being counted on the encoders, no other pins would count the encoder readings. it looks like there's an issue with the interrupt pins, which is the arduino nano has only two - INT0 and INT1 on D2 and D3 but its working for you in the video so i cant be so sure  i've tried swapping the encoders too, both are working perfectly but its just D2 and D3 that count. and this code wont work on an Arduino Mega :/  PS: im using OE-37 Hall Effect Encoders - mounted seperately  any suggestions?

Excellent good vedio  please make  more vedio

I love it. Its heaven for robotics beginners

Make a video on how to build a computer

Thank you so much these videos are amazing! I just started my journey of learning about robotics and control systems and this is making it much easier to get into this coming from a person with a theoretical physics background barely any electronics.. :)

How can i choose the rpm of the motor

Good overview for beginners!

I'm getting some issue in connections that in tutorial. The motors just moving infinitely (not stopping) for power input in my case after all connections with Arduino and raspberry pi. They were still moving without ros_arduino_bridge can u help with this issue?

Open loop is just fine in case of a stepper motor. This give very good control and is used in all kind of systems including 3D printers.

Hi !!!thanks a lot !!! Try to make underwater robot . And of course Your  lessons usefully anyway )but in addition to comlexity water and sounds . Not Elmagnetic . Study now bluerobotics forums

I can you tell me where I can learn ROS

To make a parallel between real robot and the Gazebo simulation, we can say that teleop_twist_keyboard node is Robot Controller and control plugin node (for example gazebo_ros_diff_drive) is Motor Controller. Is this correct?

❤

Great informative presentation!  Could you please comment:  If you would like to put a robot with motor control into actual use, say to raise and lower a convertible top on a car as an example, you are not going to have it hooked up to your laptop.  What is the missing link or next step to get the robot self contained in a production environment, so to speak?  Thank you.

Excellent. Got everything working in that video. Had to run "sudo apt remove brltty" to get the serial port to recognise the arduino.

name of the motors ?

Hello community, At 14:22, when it meant upload the code, Where should it be uploaded Could anyone please respond

can the arduino program on your repo need improve if i use differen motor driver shield like pololu VNH5019 or IBT-2 (BTS7960)? because i need more power for the motor

My 12V motors only have 2 "outputs" (+ and -) i dont have the other connections... what can i do?

My latest project I'm starting on is a simple eye that will follow you around the house. I have most of it yet still need to work out how to track sound using a Raspberry Pi. Any good tips?

currently i have SPG 30  E gear motor is it possible to use this method for getting values from motor to ros? and iam using Noetic

hello bro, how do you know the max rev per second of this motor equals 1.5 ???

9:03 whoa, youtube made the "subscribe" button animate when you ask viewers to click it during your video. so cool.

Can't you do this without the arduino?  Can't you just hook the motor driver to the pi?

Nicely explained

Could you make a video for people starting this hobby? Like showing what things to buy, mistakes to avoid etc…

I would like to control the suspension on a model car ( made in meccano) based on feedback from an electronic gyroscope. It is supposed to keep the body of the car level whatever the terrain.  My plan is to use a raspberry pi with an electric motor that is linked to the suspension, so your demonstration is well on the way to what I want to achieve.

A video on motor types and how yo choose them would be so awesome! I clicked on this expecting just that! Still gonna watch it though... Seems cool enough!

What's that exactly and why to use?

@adwaitingle2315  it's the Braille terminal. Josh goes over it in his ready to humble video which is on the same play list as this.

upload it on the arduino

Did you solve this problem? I'm curious, too

did you find them i need to code for bts7960

That means you don't have an inbuilt encoder, you can purchase external ones though :)

use it at max pwm, ie, 255 and measure the encoder ticks or the rpm

wow, didnt notice that

That would be great 😊

In the web page he have this

I second that! I have spent weeks trying to figure out the type of motor I should use. I've looked at the formulas for calculating  torque etc. but for some reason, it just won't "click".

Thanks for the great series Josh! Do you have any tips or good resources for adding a servo motor to the project, perhaps using the microcontroller, and being able to control it from the gamepad? For example putting the camera on a tilting mechanism so that you can pan up and down? If anyone else has done this or a similar case, I'd love to hear from you!

first of all thanks this series is awesome but i have one doubt how can i find revolution value i am using Orange OG555 High Torque DC Motor 12V 100RPM 173.6N-cm Encoder Compatible  but you said 34 revolution for your motor  but how could i find revolution  for my motor

I've been following your series and its really useful and informative!! Can u please share a link i can access the video on motors selection(as mentioned in time stamp - 1:16) if its aired already? If not i hope you can make one, would be really helpful! @ArticulatedRobotics

I have subscribed! You are doing a great job helping people learn the skills we always wanted but didnt have access to.

I would like to see a video on different motor types

Very well presented! Thank you.

I like this moda. This murder is good for robotics projects.

servos have one chronic issue is that when powering the system, they jump to home position, which causes damage to the robot sometimes. Hardware solutions not successful, but maybe something in C code can absorb this. Bet I saw many commercial robots use normal motors with rotary encoder or stepper instead of servo.

Nice sir

Hello can anyone tell me why we arent using Raspi directly to supply PWM to Motor driver. Why is Arduino Nano used?

Can you please make a video on micrROS as well?. What i understood is that microROS should have been used foe this hardware level stuff. Further why Ros control if microROS is already out there?.

Hello, I have a problem that the speed of both wheels is not the same speed, the right wheel is faster than the left wheel. What do I need to do now, please help me. Thanks a lot

Instead of gear motor is it possible to use Bldc motor ????

Great series, I have been following along building my own robot. Found a problem with using Nano with CH341 uart chip. The Raspberry Pi would no recognise the device on the USB port. It seems the 'brltty'  device interferes with the interface. Stackexchange has a fix for this - search unable-to-use-usb-dongle-based-on-usb-serial-converter-chip. Hope Josh doesn't mind me posting this.

L298 has a to high internal resistance

Hi,  will it work if I'm using DC motors without encoder? Please share some hints.

Great video.  Just getting started with ROS.  You mentioned that the L298 motor controller isn't the best, but it will do.  I agree.  What other motor controllers would you recommend or have experience with?  Thanks for your time!

I love your video on murders!!! 😁

First, thanks so much for these tutorials! They are great!  When I run miniterm, I have to use baudrate of 9600, not 57600 in order to not get English out. And it outputs a whole bunch of "sensor=xxx   ouput=xxx" lines, but it will not take in any motor commands to get the motor running. Apparently many changes have since been made to the arduino code?

Same doubt

In this example there’s only one motor but in most robotics applications there are significantly more components that need to be controlled. The raspberry pi simply doesn’t have enough pwm capable pins for more than 1 or 2 motors

I have the same problem

⁠have you fixed that problem yet?

@KSLEEProjects  Have you tried checking whether the signal read from the encoder of the 2 wheels is equal? If the signals of the two encoder are not equal, you should check the encoder's signal wire again

I did this but without encoder I  made Pwm to adjust the motor speed and set the pwm same for both the motors

Definitely agree. It is a terrible motor driver for practical applications, but it is extremely cheap and easy for beginners to use.

You'll have to make some modifications to the code if you're trying to integrate it in to the rest of the project but yes you can (and you'll only be able to run in open loop). I'd recommend running your motors under standard load at a bunch of different PWM values, calculate the number of revolutions, plot it on a graph and fit a line to it to create "fake feedback".

Hahaha it took me a minute to understand!

Great video. Please make a video about the types of motors and how to choose them.

Thanks your Guide to using Motor tutorial. Can you please detailed pictures or diagram wire connection of 12 DC encoder motor to Arduino Nano?

Great video; how can I use L293D as the motor driver?  that's what I have, and it's quite different from the one you used,?

Can we also control torque?

I thought you were saying murder instead of motors😂

I was so overwhelmed with the complexity of robot making, AI, deep learning, Lidar. Coral TPU, Hexapod design, drones. neural networks, Raspberry Pi, Linux. I could go on. I love it all but have so much to learn. I watch your videos and feel more confident about all this shenanigans. Can't wait to watch more of your videos. Top man.

Hi I used exactly the same code but I don't recieve any encoder Data. I checked the encoder manually with an Oscilloscope and it works. So I believe it has to be a problem with the code. Any idea?

Excellent presentation!

Can i follow this tutorial using ROS1 instead of ROS2?

Awesome tutorials. I am teaching myself Python now so I can start coding my own robots. These tutorials are great for the hardware side and how to get things setup with ROS. Thank you much! Oh and do you have links for the DC motors  you are using with the built-in encoders?

Hey Josh!! Thanks so much for this tutorial. Can I control the motors in open loop mode?? Like I mean for the real robot because my encoders broke 😢 and I cannot buy another

Thanks for posting, please make video on explanation on different kind of motors, thanks

Please how do we upload the Ros_Arduino_Bridge code? so far I've only been able to find how it's done with rosrun and rosbash which aren't compatible with ros2 foxy. Thanks.

If I need to add IR proximity sensors in the robot in which part I need to change the code

how can i use this to wire 4 motors instead of two with Arduino also? if there is a link that can help

Hello, first of all thanks a lot for these tutorials. I am using as5600 magnetic encoder for close-loop control of motors. So I can't use your code because encoder is communicating via I2C from analog pins of arduino uno. My question is: Which topics do I need to subscribe(cmd_vel) in order to make it work. For example, I know that I need to subscribe to cmd_vel to get wheel velocities from ros and move the robot, but where do I need to publish wheel velocities or positions to do navigation?

Not exactly accurate. You're describing Amplitude Modulation. With pulse width modulation the voltage remains constant. The O' scope will demonstrate that. PWM is Frequency Modulation. Otherwise good video. Pretty basic stuff.

congratulations I've just subscribed to your channel but could you please give all the recommendations as to what ide i can program raspberry pi  or even a video can do  i also need a full guide about programming that board for motors  __________also __________ i need to know what c++ library encompasses all sensors, basically does all that i can add to my project be it a sensor, cam etc and be good to projects concerning  motors

ubuntu 22.04 intel NUC

python3-serial installed but no miniterm????  sudo apt install miniterm: E: Unable to locate package miniterm

I'm not sure, I have not used the L293D, sorry. I thought they were fairly similar though? It is a long time since I have looked.

@ArticulatedRobotics , thanks for the response. I  found out it is much different. I decided to buy L298

Unfortunately my tutorials are ROS 2 only, although of all of them this one has a lot that is still relevant to ROS 1

I looked up Yahboom 4wd chassis and got a chassis with a set of motors with encoders. Hopefully this helps

Yeah for sure! If you are using my ros2_control hardware interface you want to replace the "write" command with one that sends an "o" message instead of an "m" message, and write a line that scales the speed request to the appropriate open loop signal.

im still trying to find a way to do this did u ever find a solution?

@althahirceja7153  Unfortunately I didn't, my setup was a bit different so it didn't work out this way

Yeah on 22.04 they've changed it, you now need to run pyserial-miniterm as the command. (this will be covered in the upcoming video :)) Same install command

@ArticulatedRobotics  Awesome thanks.  This even works with my Cytron controller but I just ordered 5 of the controllers your using cuz I just fried a channel on mine.  whoops.

@ArticulatedRobotics  Sorry, one question though.  When I start the motors at least the one on the channel that still works.  It only runs for about 5 seconds then stops.  Is this normal?

Yep, this is a safety feature. This is so that if if whatever software sends these commands to the controller crashes, the robot will stop instead of driving out of control. If you look very carefully in the video I run the commands multiple times to get it to keep going

@ArticulatedRobotics  Ah thanks.  I did not notice that but now remember you talking about it.  Thanks.

@ArticulatedRobotics  Have you ever encountered one motor spinning faster than the other?  Maybe the gear box in one of them is sticky.  Can this be compensated for or should I just replace the motor?

Great video! I have been following through the series.  I just wondering, when you did the open loop control to get the thick count, did you run it on full speed (255)? I would love to watch the PID control video if you make one later. Thanks!

Hello where can I find the code for the L298N and Arduino?

Do you have any BLDC Hub motor or DC motor controller explanation?

Good job! Ceep work on these projects, thanks for content!

Can't use Raspberry pi as a motor controller instead of using Arduino?

Amazing and so helpful video. Would be great to have a list of all things used in this video. Wondering what is a ground regulator (its on the top left side)

Amazing !!!

I have mine wired up just like your and everything works. My only questions is when I send the O command the motors spin for a few seconds and stop on their own

Hey all, Scott here!

great video can you upload the modified version of RosArduinoBridge for arduino nano and l298n ?

This video is great! Thank you 😊

hey i recently found your chanel and I love them all! some tips and tricks already brought me a lot of pleasure in my turtleproject. so i started with installing Arduino_bridge. I noticed that my wheels stop after 1 second bit yours keep spinning untill the stop command..  Also when swithing to feedback mode in the gui  it gives me a string to float error. this is a short of whats happening https://youtu.be/-WTgZopnEkQ  could you plz help with this?

FINALLY A GOOD TUTORIAL ON HOW TO STRUCTURE A GOD DAMN ROBOT

Underated  Video

Thank you for your guide!!!! That must be helpful for my future project.

This whole series has been terrific, with clear and concise explanations and instructions. I have had one issue I haven't been able to figure out. I have wired up these motors six ways from Sunday. I've studied the diagrams and the setup on the video and duplicated it perfectly. Even so, when teleop-ing I find the motors run fine forwards and backwards, but when using j and l to turn left or right, the controls are reversed! Left goes right and right turns left. Seems weird, as turning just consists of one wheel going forwards and the other backwards. I've tested this with a joypad as well with the same results. No combination of wiring I've tried seems to work. If I wire up by switching the pins then left and right are fine, but forward and backward are then reversed. Ive even tried reversing the motor leads. If anyone else has found this to be a problem and have found a solution please drop me a note.

Absolutely awesome video

Id really like a video on what motors are best for what purpose, thanks for the video!

I'm running both the GUI and the driver on my laptop. And it doesn't seem it is sending anything, it is constantly giving a time-out error.

What motors do you use that have the encoders built on? Can you include links or model numbers?

Not at the moment, but I'd like to!

@ArticulatedRobotics  Can I get your professional contact details?

Hi, you can but (as outlined in the video) it is often better to decouple them. That way the arduino can focus on the low-level control, and the Pi can handle high-level tasks, and the either can be swapped out with ease.

Thanks, yes mine does too, it's just not obvious from the video as I kept repeating the command. This is part of the design, the idea is that the thing controlling it should keep sending speed requests, and if it loses connection or something the motors will then stop after a few seconds instead of driving out of control :)

@ArticulatedRobotics  Thanks for the clarification Im far into your tutorial and robot has not failed me and niether have you 😁

@ArticulatedRobotics  This is happening for me, even when using the teleop keyboard and joystick to control the motors. I thought it could be a power issue, but it also occurs when controlling a single motor, and using a power supply. Any ideas?

​ @ArticulatedRobotics yeah man you missed a big part here how can we repeat the commands so that the motors keeps spinning and we can measure encoder counts?

have you found the solution?

I figured it out, I had my encoders on the wrong pins. Duh.

I love the way you systematically explain complex topics. What software do you use to create your beautiful diagrams/flow charts for your videos?

Anyone know why I would have the motors be able to spin but the encoders not count up even when it is wired in correctly? really odd. I followed the tutorial pins exactly, just one an arduino mega which shouldn't have any difference for this.

Is there any idea, why I got "miniterm command not found" error even i install python3-serial as "sudo apt install python3-serial" on my ubuntu 22.04 ? Thanks in advance for your help.

Hello Josh, I'm trying to use the Arduino Mega with this example, but I'm having trouble with the encoder's ports, I think that ports C doesn't work as it should using Arduino mega, how can I switch from port C to port F? And is it harder to change this code to work in the Arduino mega?

This is a great guide to robotics for beginners. Covers more practical material than a 4000 electro-mechanical devices class for mechanical engineers lol. Although terminology may be the limiting factor for some but aside from the lingo this is perfect. I'm SHOCKED that this doesn't have at least 100,000 views. Great work!

This is so much better than most ROS tutorials out there from a learning perspective! Excellent job! Most other tutorials out there barrel ahead with terminal commands with no context or practical hardware examples. Thank you!

I really like they way how you went step by step through the topics. Maybe you can explain the ROS side more deeply for future projects. Thank you.

I’m having trouble adding the ros arduino bridge library to my IDE. Any suggestions? I’m trying to add it as a .zip but the IDE says it’s an invalid library.

awesome tutorial many thanks

Hello, thank you for this video, please how can i use the same thing but with ESC and brusless motor ?

typical electrical youtuber dope. Skipping over the most IMPORTANT part, which is the wiring hook ups demo and showing only the end results. And your dumbass accent doesn't help to not make me hate you.

i love it. works fine for me.. big thanks..

I would actually love to see the motor video on how to choose them and how to control the various types of motors (induction, DC, Universal, AC, 2-phase, 3-phase) what does it all mean for my project making journey?

I want to drive 4 brushless gear motors (mecanum wheels) that have built-in encoders, there are 5 wires coming out. I need a cheap driver one for each wheel any suggestions. Thanks for the great vid.

It is hard to find such a good tutorials series of ROS2. Thank for your sharing!

How does serial_motor_demo/driver knows the exact commands to send to arduino? does it emit the same commands you were sending manually - "o <number> <number>", "e",... ?

Yes to Videos on Motors! Great video!

yes a video on different types of motor would be great

Do raspberry pi circuits require the computer to be plugged in the whole time while a program runs? Or can u download the code onto the raspberry pi?

Very good video. Can you make a video for rosserial for ros2 ?

Thanks! 90% of my diagrams are done using Inkscape as white lines/text on a transparent background. I edit in DaVinci Resolve, so I use its compositor (Fusion) to take the static images from Inkscape, overlay them on the background, fade in/out, do extra lines, etc. In addition to that, there are bits and pieces done in GIMP, Blender, and Manim. And, for what it's worth, all done on Linux!  I hope to do some more theory/concept stuff in the future and make better use of manim (originally created by Grant Sanderson for his channel 3Blue1Brown) :)

I got the same issue. With the arduino mega it doesn't seem to work for me

@Swqtt  I just bought a nano, works perfectly

Okay I got the answer. it was changed to pyserial-miniterm. But still you may have an error which is "Errno 13 Permission denied: '/dev/ttyUSB0" . You have to command this "sudo usermod -a -G dialout <username>  # To allow access to the /dev/ttyUSB# " and reboot. everythings will work.

Hi, sorry I didn't get to this sooner, I'm glad you got it sorted. I do have the usermod thing in the video but that is very helpful to know that the miniterm package has changed, I will keep that in mind if people ask in the future.

Ooh it's been a while since I've written Arduino code and I've never used the mega before. I am quite certain it will be a very simple fix - just a matter of knowing the right thing.  I would have thought it's a matter of just changing the defines in encoder.h to be the new pins?

@Mateus did u solve it??

did you solve this?

Thanks so much!!

Thanks!

Thanks! Yeah as much as I tried to cram as much as I could into it, there really is so much more to say on the topic - I have a never-ending list of ideas to get through!

It shouldn't need to be added as a library (I think maybe there are similar ones out there that do). It should just be a sketch to open and flash to the Arduino :)

@ArticulatedRobotics  Thanks. Got it to work! Any reason why my motors only run for a couple seconds in open loop mode? When I type o 255 255 they run and stop automatically after about three seconds.

Nevermind! Auto stop timer...

Thanks!

Yeah a lot of people have asked for that! I will definitely do that eventually, but probably not too soon as I have a lot of other topics coming up :)

Thanks for your feedback. I'm not sure I agree on that being the most important part - this video is more about demonstrating the principles, and everybody's own motors/drivers/other hardware may be a little different. But for sure, I perhaps could have shown that in more detail. Regarding my accent, there's not a whole lot I can do - you're welcome to provide a list of preferred accents for me to try but I can almost assure you they'd come out worse ;)

That would be too much. accompany mr newans on his journey. it's going to be interesting enough

Haha thank you, I'm glad to have you both along for the journey! I would like to make some videos going deeper into those different motor types, but at this rate that will probably be a very long ways off (like 12 month+) I hope to do one on Brushless DC motors in the shorter term (maybe in 6 months or so) as they are very relevant to the hobby and small commercial robotics that I'm focusing on at the moment.

@ArticulatedRobotics  I would like to rewrite the Rosbridge for Arduino so that 4 of the 12V DC motors can be used and read. check out my channel for the reason :) I look forward to continuing my journey with you.

Thanks! My experience with brushless motors is actually pretty limited unfortunately (something I am keen to explore more in the future). Do you have a link to the particular motors I could look at? Some have a driver on-board.  The main brushless driver I am aware of is ODrive (https://odriverobotics.com/) but it is not cheap. Some similar ones are reviewed here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb1gsJ4K4pM  Alternatively you may have luck using an esc like those used for drones and then wrap that in a closed-loop control of some kind using the encoders.  Sorry I couldn't be more help, like I said I definitely want to dive deeper on this in the future!

Thanks!

That's exactly right. The driver is just sending the same commands I was sending manually. The only difference is it has a bit of code that converts the value in rad/s (that the gui is publishing) to counts/loop (that the Arduino expects). Check out the code here (good bit highlighted) https://github.com/joshnewans/serial_motor_demo/blob/da60760df16b868f2ef487e485e480d28b7d46db/serial_motor_demo/serial_motor_demo/driver.py#L82-L106

Sorry for the late reply. Hopefully I understand correctly. The Raspberry Pi is itself a computer, so it will be running the main software for the robot.  Right now, we connect to the Pi remotely and start software on it, then use gui software on the dev PC to interact with it. In the future, we'll set up the Pi software to run automatically on startup so that it can do things without a PC connected, although most of the time it will be just easier to have the PC connected (over Wi-Fi) so we can visualise, and perform more complex tasks.

Thanks. I think last I checked there was no version of rosserial for ROS 2? It's a long time since I looked into it though. I'll keep it in mind for the future :)

Yes, if you haven't already made a video on the motors, please do. Would you also include examples of situations you could use each motor type?

Very good explained video!

Great Video!! Please make a video on motors.

The best

great work!

Only ROS CHANNEL that makes sense

Just great 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

I REALLY LOVE THIS PROJECTS

Great explanation! I love how you threw in cutting-edge ROS2 in there!

Yep, it's definitely on my list of videos to make after I've finished this current series :)

Thanks!

Thanks!

Thanks!

Thanks so much!

Thanks!

Thanks :D

.... while at the same time using a motor driver that is about 40y or so old, and which has been superseded by loads of more energy efficient mosfet based products that don't need a heatsink the size of a car radiator.
