[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:03.000] Now that we have looked at positions and velocities,
[00:00:03.000 → 00:00:07.000] it's time to study the dynamics of a quadrotor.
[00:00:07.000 → 00:00:12.000] Once again, let's remind ourselves that we have two coordinate systems,
[00:00:12.000 → 00:00:16.000] one attached to the moving robot,
[00:00:16.000 → 00:00:20.000] and the other, the inertial coordinate system.
[00:00:20.000 → 00:00:26.000] B1, B2, B3 constitute the set of unit vectors
[00:00:26.000 → 00:00:29.000] that describe the body fixed coordinate system,
[00:00:29.000 → 00:00:36.000] and likewise A1, A2, A3 describe the coordinate system that's fixed to the inertial frame.
[00:00:36.000 → 00:00:41.000] Recall that you have four rotors, each of which is independently actuated.
[00:00:41.000 → 00:00:45.000] R is the position vector of the center of mass,
[00:00:45.000 → 00:00:52.000] and we know expressions for the thrusts that the motors produce on the airframe.
[00:00:52.000 → 00:00:57.000] We also know the expressions for the reaction moments,
[00:00:57.000 → 00:01:04.000] and both of these are proportional to the square of the angular speeds of the rotors.
[00:01:04.000 → 00:01:09.000] We've seen how Euler angles are used to represent rotations.
[00:01:09.000 → 00:01:19.000] We will use the ZXY convention, the first rotation being about the Z-axis through Psi,
[00:01:19.000 → 00:01:28.000] the second one about the X-axis, and the third one about the Y-axis.
[00:01:28.000 → 00:01:35.000] So the first axis is yaw, the second one is roll, the third one is pitch.
[00:01:35.000 → 00:01:43.000] Again, just to remind ourselves, this is the ZXY convention.
[00:01:43.000 → 00:01:46.000] The first rotation is the ZXY convention.
[00:01:46.000 → 00:01:51.000] The second rotation is about the X-axis through Psi, this is the roll angle.
[00:01:51.000 → 00:01:55.000] And finally, the pitch about the Y-axis through Psi.
[00:01:55.000 → 00:01:59.000] Of course, there are singularities.
[00:01:59.000 → 00:02:05.000] Singularities occur when the roll angle is equal to zero, which is Psi equal to zero.
[00:02:05.000 → 00:02:18.000] And even when the angle phi is not equal to zero, you can have two sets of Euler angles for every rotation.
[00:02:18.000 → 00:02:23.000] Let's look at the external forces and moments that act on the airframe.
[00:02:23.000 → 00:02:34.000] We have four thrusts, F1, F2, and F3, and F4, and then four moments, M1, M2, and M3, and M4.
[00:02:34.000 → 00:02:44.000] The sum of the forces is obtained by adding up the thrust vectors and the gravity vector.
[00:02:44.000 → 00:02:52.000] The sum of the moments is obtained by adding up the reaction moments, as well as the moments of the thrust forces.
[00:02:52.000 → 00:02:55.000] Again, these are vector computations.
[00:02:55.000 → 00:03:00.000] You have to add 3 by 1 vectors in each of these equations.
[00:03:00.000 → 00:03:08.000] To predict the net acceleration, we have to write down the equations of motion.
[00:03:08.000 → 00:03:15.000] These come from Newton and Euler, and they're called the Newton-Euler equations.
[00:03:15.000 → 00:03:16.000] Down is another direction of your nest.
[00:03:16.000 → 00:03:17.000] You set up theength vector transport Gestanca стен.
[00:03:17.000 → 00:03:18.000] By holding 2 points that each of which is used in passive существ,
[00:03:18.000 → 00:03:22.000] against Lot alta Ettrace, Hence, this is Psi equal to 0,8-17-18-18-50,
[00:03:22.000 → 00:03:23.000] This is a Psi someone at 616-Euler equation.
[00:03:23.000 → 00:03:24.000] From Python and for AirPods two, please look at how mouse some places are rolling.
[00:03:24.000 → 00:03:26.000] Its number of the non-looking names and these ones are rolling.
[00:03:26.000 → 00:03:28.000] This means introduction alone.
[00:03:28.000 → 00:03:30.000] It is a Psi late.
[00:03:30.000 → 00:03:31.000] It is the pin.
