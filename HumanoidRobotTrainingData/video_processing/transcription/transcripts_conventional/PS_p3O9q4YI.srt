3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,280
Welcome!

4
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:56,920
Today we start the design of a Class AB discrete power amplifier for audio purposes.

5
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:12,980
As promised in the previous video, which I posted as a demo, we'll be able to design a 25W power amplifier that we can use for, as earlier mentioned, for audio purposes.

6
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:26,980
And, you know, for exploring discrete power transistors and small signals transistors used in audio applications.

7
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:38,980
As you can see on the screen, this is the Class AB audio amplifier that we'll be designing in the next two or three videos.

8
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:51,040
Today we should be able to basically spec out our specification of what this amplifier is going to achieve.

9
00:01:51,040 --> 00:02:08,020
And, at least, come up with some values for, say, for the power supply and some of the output transistors that we need in order to achieve or design this amplifier completely.

10
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:19,600
So, before we get started, like I started at the beginning of the video with a preview of the sound that you can expect from such an amplifier,

11
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:29,320
let's give you another demo, and from there we'll proceed to get the specifications for this power amplifier.

12
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,380
So, let's play another demo just to show you the capability of this discrete power amplifier.

13
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,640
Okay.

14
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:48,860
Of course, this camera, this cheap camera that I'm using is not going to reproduce the full scale of sounds that is produced by my speakers.

15
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,660
So, I mean, in real life, this is going to sound much better.

16
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:11,540
But, regardless, this is just to give you a demo and as well as a motivation to stick with this video because we're going to go into a lot of details and calculating all the values of each component shown on this circuit here

17
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:22,500
and why each component is chosen based on its characteristics and the function of each device.

18
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:32,960
So, since we're going to do that, this video will give you just a motivation to stick with the video and learn basically the material that I'll be presenting.

19
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:43,940
So, let's go ahead and give a small demo again just to give you an idea of how well this amplifier performs.

20
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:55,260
And, of course, we'll be doing once we go through the tutorial, we'll do a testing of the performance and characteristic of this amplifier,

21
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,740
including the distortion performance, power handling capability, and, you know, frequency response.

22
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:09,240
So, but for now, I think listening test will basically give us an idea how well this performs.

23
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:18,460
And, of course, you can see that I have laid it out in this sort of this breadboard here.

24
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:28,160
So, and, you know, as you can see, you know, as you might be aware, they're not the best for if you're going to achieve low noise circuits.

25
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:43,220
So, this will, you know, whatever you hear, if we laid out in a PCB, we'll be able to achieve much better performance out of it in terms of the quality of the sound.

26
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:52,480
So, but regardless, even, you know, the way it's shown, you know, the way it's constructed, this is quite capable amplifier.

27
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,040
So, let's give a listen.

28
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,540
Okay, here we go.

29
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:43,200
So, let's go ahead and do this.

30
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,760
And get the specifications for this power amplifier.

31
00:05:48,440 --> 00:06:01,820
To start it, let's talk about the power, because that's one of the most important functions of any power amplifier is actually to get the small signal that we receive at the inputs.

32
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:15,040
And from a, say, for example, from a pre-amplifier, and then basically get a power gain and feed a very low impedance load.

33
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:25,940
So, since that's one of the main functions of a power amplifier, the power that I chose for this amplifier is 25 watts.

34
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,540
Reason is, for personal use and in home applications, you're not going to need more than 25 watts.

35
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:38,000
Basically, that's ample enough power.

36
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:53,180
And if you have decent speakers, which are efficient, delivering 25 watts to them, they should be able to convert that to a very impressive sound.

37
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,580
And, like I said, in home environment.

38
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,660
So, that's why I chose 25 watts.

39
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,660
And the power amplifier should also handle very low impedance load.

40
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,820
For example, for this application, I have chosen it to handle at least 4 ohms.

41
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,960
Minimum 4 ohms.

42
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,180
It should be able to handle 8 ohms speakers as well.

43
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,560
But 4 ohms is the load that we should be able to handle.

44
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:33,240
The THD for this amplifier, of course, is an important specification as well.

45
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:43,820
It needs to be less than 0.1% at full power output.

46
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:53,420
And at 20 kHz.

47
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,640
And as we'll talk about why this specification is necessary, why I'm putting the frequency.

48
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:14,040
But, basically, the total harmonic distortion of this power amplifier should be less than or equal to 0.1% at full load output power.

49
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,180
And, you know, we could go, you know, play around with the amplifier to actually reduce this to much lower levels.

50
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,220
But 0.1% should be enough for the purposes of this video.

51
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:38,720
And we should achieve, we should be able to achieve this and work towards to make this amplifier have that much distortion at the full output power at 20 kHz.

52
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,800
Next is the, another important specification that we need to cover is the frequency response.

53
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:53,240
The frequency response of this amplifier should be from 20 to 20 kHz.

54
00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:03,040
This is normal for audio purposes because our hearing, human hearing, is in this range.

55
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:15,260
So, we should be able to basically have a flat response in terms of the gain and power delivery to our speaker.

56
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,140
This is frequency.

57
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,680
This is the amplitude.

58
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:24,920
Say, the amplitude of the voltage we deliver to the load.

59
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,320
Or, I can also say the power.

60
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,180
I could just plot it in power.

61
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:38,300
We should be able to get a flat response all the way from 20 Hz to 20 kHz.

62
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,000
Okay?

63
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,800
So, if we choose the components into the class AV amplifier that we'll design properly,

64
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,820
we should be able to achieve this specification as well.

65
00:09:48,820 --> 00:10:01,440
So, these are the main important specifications that we need to adhere to basically design this power amplifier.

66
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:10,120
So, let's go ahead and get started figuring out some of the things we need to achieve this specification.

67
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,500
One of them is the power supply requirement.

68
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,320
So, in order to deliver 25 watts to a 4 ohm load,

69
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,200
we're going to need a specific power supply.

70
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,760
And we can get that by just doing a simple calculation.

71
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,180
So, the power delivered, and remember, this power is average power.

72
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,860
We're not talking about the peak power rubbish that a lot of manufacturers put on their amplifiers.

73
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,780
We're talking about average power delivered to the load.

74
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:52,760
So, the average power given to a load is given by the formula,

75
00:10:53,540 --> 00:11:00,240
the RMS voltage squared divided by the load impedance, right?

76
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,540
So, in this case, 4 ohms.

77
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,100
The reason why we'll take 4 ohms in this calculation will be apparent in a second.

78
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:14,800
So, if we rearrange this equation, all we're going to get is the RMS voltage,

79
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:23,180
and this should be the minimum RMS voltage that we need in order to achieve the 25 watt output,

80
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:32,720
is going to be the root square of the average power multiplied by the load impedance, right?

81
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,240
So, if we go ahead and calculate that,

82
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:45,120
we're going to get, so basically this is 25 multiplied by,

83
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,300
so 25 multiplied by 4,

84
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,620
and the answer is 10 volts RMS.

85
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,060
So, why did I choose 4 ohms?

86
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,380
So, typically in a speaker,

87
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,540
we'll have, basically its dominant characteristics is the resistance of the voice coil,

88
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,320
although at higher frequencies,

89
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,920
the impedance does go high

90
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,340
because of the inductance of the speaker coils,

91
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,960
or the voice coil,

92
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,480
but the minimum impedance that we can expect from a single speaker,

93
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,580
you know, from one speaker,

94
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:28,900
would be,

95
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,720
so for example,

96
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,480
if I was to look at this speaker here,

97
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,300
for example,

98
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,380
the minimum impedance that I expect to see at the terminals of the speaker,

99
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,500
is the DC resistance of the speaker.

100
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,660
So, if this speaker,

101
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,800
if we go ahead and measure with our multimeter here set into ohms,

102
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,120
basically we'll get the lowest case impedance

103
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
that this speaker will present to the power amplifier.

104
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,680
So, basically that's why I chose 4 ohms,

105
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,000
and the speakers I have,

106
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,760
which I showed you at the beginning of the video,

107
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,740
I have,

108
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,240
basically the,

109
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,080
the,

110
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,960
the,

111
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,000
the,

112
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,520
subwoofer,

113
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,360
speakers are 4 ohms,

114
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,020
they have an actual 4 ohms,

115
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,720
DC resistance,

116
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,000
but,

117
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,580
you should,

118
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,060
I should be careful in case of my speakers,

119
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,480
because it's a three-way speaker,

120
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,140
so it has a crossover network,

121
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,360
so the,

122
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,360
the two other speakers,

123
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,780
the midrange and the tweeter,

124
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,600
will also be in parallel with it,

125
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,000
so they,

126
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:35,420
that,

127
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:35,880
you know,

128
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,280
the,

129
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,600
the,

130
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,860
using multimeter to actually measure the DC resistance,

131
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,620
in that case,

132
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,140
is not really advisable,

133
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:43,660
if you're,

134
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,400
so basically,

135
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,700
the 4 ohms is only for a single speaker like this,

136
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,100
basically.

137
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,380
So,

138
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,360
that's why I chose 4 ohms here.

139
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,000
So,

140
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,420
another thing that we can go ahead and figure out,

141
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,500
is also the,

142
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,360
peak voltage amplitude that we need,

143
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,040
from this,

144
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,180
so the,

145
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,100
the peak,

146
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,120
of this is,

147
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,360
if,

148
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,100
basically we're using a,

149
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,800
sine wave,

150
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,640
in this case,

151
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,880
so if we do that,

152
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,580
then it's basically going to be,

153
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,700
uh,

154
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:20,880
10,

155
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,120
multiplied by the square root of 2,

156
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,760
so that is going to be around 14.14 volts,

157
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,500
peak,

158
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,040
right,

159
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,860
uh,

160
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,720
and,

161
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,040
that's something we can use,

162
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,740
but remember,

163
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:34,560
uh,

164
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,400
we'll have some,

165
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:35,820
uh,

166
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,000
losses at the output of the,

167
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,640
uh,

168
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:39,320
the,

169
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:39,520
you know,

170
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,500
the power devices,

171
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,240
so the power devices here,

172
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,820
will have some losses,

173
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,260
right,

174
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,780
because,

175
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:45,620
uh,

176
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,860
we'll be using a Darlander now,

177
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,240
output,

178
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:47,520
uh,

179
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,460
this transistor will never saturate,

180
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,480
uh,

181
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,160
so there will be quite a bit of,

182
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,500
uh,

183
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,540
voltage drop here,

184
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,340
when the,

185
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,500
at the peak of the,

186
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,840
positive or,

187
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,460
on the negative of the,

188
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,040
output of the,

189
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,460
uh,

190
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,180
signal,

191
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,700
and also the,

192
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,660
since the emitted degeneration resistor,

193
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,340
we're using,

194
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,160
0.22 ohms,

195
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,500
will also have a loss there,

196
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,200
and remember,

197
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,680
since this stage,

198
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,660
we'll be driving this stage,

199
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,060
this is just only a power gain,

200
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,000
uh,

201
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,800
so this stage,

202
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,620
since this stage is,

203
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,140
you know,

204
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,780
this is a common emitter output,

205
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,000
the,

206
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,400
uh,

207
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,340
voltage will follow,

208
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,420
this voltage will follow,

209
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,020
this voltage,

210
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,620
but remember,

211
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,520
we have two diode,

212
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,240
two diode drops here as well,

213
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,700
so we'll have considerable amount of drop,

214
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,000
so,

215
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,920
our DC rail,

216
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,080
this DC rail,

217
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,180
and this DC rail,

218
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,940
we have to make sure that,

219
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,580
we account those losses,

220
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,320
in order to,

221
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,700
if we are to deliver 25 watts,

222
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:42,760
so,

223
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,860
what I'll do is,

224
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,160
I,

225
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm going to be generous,

226
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,340
and assume that,

227
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:46,760
the,

228
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,080
losses across those output devices,

229
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,940
plus the emitted degeneration resistor,

230
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,340
uh,

231
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,880
is going to be around 4 volts,

232
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,000
so I'm just going to add 4 volts to this,

233
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,340
so,

234
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,220
the,

235
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,100
plus,

236
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,980
or minus,

237
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,600
DC volts,

238
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,620
that we'll use,

239
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,000
for our rails,

240
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,360
will be 18 volts,

241
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:04,940
okay,

242
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:05,920
so,

243
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,520
that's what we'll have,

244
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:07,920
so,

245
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,220
plus,

246
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,400
or minus 18 volts,

247
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
is our DC rail,

248
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:12,880
okay,

249
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,980
next is,

250
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,040
uh,

251
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,360
we can figure out,

252
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,240
what the maximum dissipation,

253
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:19,600
is,

254
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:19,820
uh,

255
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,540
going to be across our load,

256
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,600
during the entire wave,

257
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:23,780
so,

258
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:24,300
for example,

259
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,800
if we put a test signal here,

260
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,860
like a sine wave,

261
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,000
and,

262
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,520
we test the power capability of this,

263
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,680
this amplifier,

264
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,620
we're going to find that,

265
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,000
during this time,

266
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,780
during this whole,

267
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,520
period,

268
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,540
basically,

269
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,160
you know,

270
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,440
this,

271
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,260
this is going to be somewhere around,

272
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,940
like I said,

273
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,220
you know,

274
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:46,820
you know,

275
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,060
14 volts,

276
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,500
let's say,

277
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,280
14 volts,

278
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,020
assuming there will be a few losses here,

279
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,260
we're using 18,

280
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
and minus 18 volts here,

281
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,700
so,

282
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,240
during this,

283
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:56,720
the,

284
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,600
these power devices,

285
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,640
will dissipate certain amount of power,

286
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:01,020
right,

287
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,020
so,

288
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,700
what is the maximum power,

289
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,900
that we need to make sure,

290
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,220
in order to choose the right devices,

291
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:07,520
right,

292
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,400
so,

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,540
to do that,

294
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,220
it's,

295
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:10,580
uh,

296
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,120
very easy to show,

297
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,460
that the,

298
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,220
maximum power dissipated,

299
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,300
across,

300
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,760
such devices,

301
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:19,580
you know,

302
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,760
across such an individual device,

303
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:22,940
per,

304
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,080
half of the sine wave,

305
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,380
is given by,

306
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,980
this formula here,

307
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,880
P dissipation maximum,

308
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,660
across those output devices,

309
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,780
during,

310
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,080
half of the sine wave,

311
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,280
so,

312
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,440
for the positive peak,

313
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,900
and for the negative peak of,

314
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,240
you know,

315
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,280
during that entire,

316
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,760
uh,

317
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,340
period,

318
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:43,980
basically,

319
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,900
is given by,

320
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,360
the,

321
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,100
formula again,

322
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,440
and we're going to take the peak voltage,

323
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,520
and square it,

324
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,460
and then of course,

325
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,520
this would be the maximum,

326
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,120
right,

327
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,500
remember,

328
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,280
so,

329
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:55,620
actually,

330
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,340
I should specify,

331
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,140
that this is,

332
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,320
V peak,

333
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,720
max,

334
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,360
right,

335
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,200
so,

336
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,300
basically,

337
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,020
it's that,

338
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,200
divided by,

339
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,000
pi square,

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,660
multiplied by,

341
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,980
the load resistance,

342
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,640
and remember,

343
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,060
uh,

344
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,900
it's very easy,

345
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,920
to show this formula,

346
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,660
if you want,

347
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,120
uh,

348
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,980
I can,

349
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,620
show you,

350
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,560
in the next video,

351
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,760
if you feel like it,

352
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:19,800
you can leave it,

353
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,400
in the comments,

354
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,240
but it's very easy,

355
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,420
to derive this formula,

356
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,280
uh,

357
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,240
why that's the case,

358
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,460
you know,

359
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:24,680
the,

360
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,120
the maximum power dissipation,

361
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,020
across those devices,

362
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,160
so,

363
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,040
if we do that,

364
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,640
uh,

365
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:29,980
we'll,

366
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,300
you know,

367
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,860
plug all the values in here,

368
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,800
we plug 2,

369
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,080
times 18 squared,

370
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,280
divided by,

371
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:35,980
pi square,

372
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,200
multiplied by 4,

373
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
we're going to get,

374
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,700
uh,

375
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,200
basically,

376
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,220
we're going to get,

377
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:43,720
around,

378
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,800
16.4 watts,

379
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,200
okay,

380
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,680
so,

381
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,660
we have to make sure,

382
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,320
that the output devices,

383
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,440
these,

384
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,640
output devices,

385
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,500
are capable of,

386
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,460
dissipating,

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
16.4 watts,

388
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:00,900
at,

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,400
uh,

390
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,020
you know,

391
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:02,440
at,

392
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:02,800
uh,

393
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,820
certain temperature,

394
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,960
we cannot use the,

395
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,300
uh,

396
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,640
ambient temperature,

397
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,440
because obviously,

398
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,060
the junction is going to,

399
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,740
heat up,

400
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:10,920
uh,

401
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,540
because,

402
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,020
you know,

403
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,180
the power dissipation,

404
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,580
so,

405
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,820
by looking at the,

406
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,800
the data sheet of this devices,

407
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,840
we can take a look,

408
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,120
but,

409
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,220
uh,

410
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,140
all we have to make sure,

411
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,480
is that,

412
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:21,720
you know,

413
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,980
for the power we've chosen,

414
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,480
our devices need to dissipate,

415
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,340
uh,

416
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,900
a minimum of 16.4 watts,

417
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,240
okay,

418
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,340
so,

419
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,240
and if you're going to use,

420
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:32,700
uh,

421
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,560
devices that,

422
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:33,900
I'll,

423
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,660
I'll spec in this,

424
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,200
um,

425
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,080
in this amplifier,

426
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,120
if you're going to use different devices,

427
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,560
then those devices should be able to,

428
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,260
dissipate that amount of,

429
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,080
power at a higher,

430
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,640
junction temperature,

431
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:46,920
okay,

432
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:47,980
so,

433
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,540
these are the specifications,

434
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,780
for this power amplifier,

435
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:52,920
uh,

436
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,740
what I'll do is,

437
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,080
uh,

438
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,320
hopefully by tomorrow,

439
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,600
uh,

440
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,040
I should be able to go in,

441
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,960
and design,

442
00:19:59,420 --> 00:19:59,920
the,

443
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,460
input stage,

444
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,240
of this amplifier completely,

445
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,220
and,

446
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:04,540
you know,

447
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,620
we'll design this section tomorrow,

448
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,940
uh,

449
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,020
on the input stage,

450
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,140
and why we're using a differential amplifier,

451
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,580
versus,

452
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,880
you know,

453
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,860
a single ended amplifier,

454
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,120
I will go into the details,

455
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,760
and if you want,

456
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,400
as a preview,

457
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,500
you can go ahead,

458
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,680
and watch my other video,

459
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,480
that goes into detail,

460
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:23,800
of,

461
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,240
uh,

462
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,720
an amp,

463
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,100
um,

464
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,640
a differential amplifier design,

465
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,560
uh,

466
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:27,920
so,

467
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,840
as a refresher,

468
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,380
if you want,

469
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:30,680
so,

470
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:31,860
uh,

471
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,100
that's where I'm at,

472
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,720
at the moment,

473
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,140
so,

474
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,280
let's basically,

475
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,920
close this video,

476
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,380
by playing,

477
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:38,940
uh,

478
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,240
well,

479
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,200
we don't need to play again,

480
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,140
I was going to play another,

481
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,580
uh,

482
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:41,960
demo,

483
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,220
but,

484
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:42,520
we've,

485
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,600
you've heard the amplifiers,

486
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,020
you know,

487
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:44,360
sounds,

488
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,240
uh,

489
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,220
quite okay,

490
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:46,660
so,

491
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,360
we'll call it at that,

492
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:48,760
and,

493
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,080
uh,

494
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,540
basically,

495
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,640
I'll see you in the next video,

496
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,520
where we'll design the input stage,

497
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,820
thank you very much for watching,

498
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,660
