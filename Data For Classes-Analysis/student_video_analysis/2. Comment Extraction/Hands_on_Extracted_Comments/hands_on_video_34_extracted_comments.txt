Hi sir urs contact number

Sir Kindly give a stl file for arm parts...

Make Dave the Robot from JesseandMike please!

Thats a awesome robot armi know theorical physics so i can already imagine what its like to make my own after all Einstein was also a theorical physicist and he said himself that imagination is more important than knowledge.

can i please get the 3D design of the arm?

You don't explain the circuits properly in your video, how to build it and how not to build it

This is fascinating, my fiance had her right arm amputated and the world of prosthetics are lacking unless you can spend a ton of money. Her current one is awesome but the company disappeared.

Очень интересно, не останавливайтесь пожалуйста, у вас круто получилось!

Are you able to upload CAD Schematics for hand and where to get wires and EMG?

Give me your number please

Amazing!

Круто получилось!!! Автору респект👍👍👍

Dear, the way you sense the signal generated by the muscles of the hand you cannot move each finger individually, since in the forearm there are more than 10 muscles that are activated individually according to the movement of the fingers, wrist , palm. What you have done, at best, is preprogram a sequence that changes when you receive a muscle signal from anything that moves in your forearm. You are a liar.The worst thing is that there are 940k who follow your lies.

hello this is grate and very nice, but can you send the file of 3D printer for the hand please?

Love your work same to Again video details

okay its fake

Бред,лучшие компании по протезированию не смогли добится даже минимально различимых импульсов ,для управления пальцами отдельно.

Sir from where did you buy all these parts

this is not right you are using ECG sensor not EMG sensor and you can't have all motions with a single sensor :/

bhaiya you doing nice work

you are the best. love from j&k

why is there a delay? more importantly how do you get rid of the delay to the point that its faster than you can think?

I think I can make one

How much price?😊

kyunki Meri one finger nahi hai

bhai mujhe one finger sensor chahie

From where did you have got this robot hand structure

Wow, your channel is amazing! I have a dream of building an advanced, self-learning humanoid multipurpose robot with all kinds of AI capabilities that currently aren't possible with the existing technology. To achieve this, I'm planning my educational journey after completing my 12th grade. I'm highly enthusiastic about pursuing a degree in Mechatronics, an exciting and interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. By studying Mechatronics, I will gain a comprehensive understanding of designing and building robotic systems that integrate seamlessly with advanced AI technologies.  In addition to Mechatronics, I'm also keen on delving into AI, mathematics, cognitive science, and human-computer interaction to further enhance my knowledge and skills. I believe that this multidisciplinary approach will enable me to create a truly innovative and human-like robot that can communicate, learn, and adapt just like us.  I'm constantly amazed by the rapid advancements in technology, and I'm determined to be at the forefront of this revolution. As someone with big dreams, I would greatly appreciate any advice or suggestions you may have to offer. Your channel has been a great source of inspiration and knowledge for me. Keep up the fantastic work!

There is noway 3 sensors will pick up signals from the muscle controlling 5 fingers and differentiates it correctly. This definitely is fake. Each finger is controlled by 2 sets of muscles in the forearm and thumb has a separate muscle. And there are multiple small muscles in the palm which help control each finger. Its not as easy as shown in  the video. That an ecg lead will pick up signal from individual muscle group as separate and move each finger correctly

Pls share STL file

That feeling when you click on a yt video with english title, and sudently you can't understand any word and you wonder if you have a stroke or the video isn't in english

Pacific rim is gettijng closer to reality now

how are you detecting the movement of all the five finger with one muscle sensor. can you share the details?

who needs a thumb when u got the middle finger working perfectly...

Great invention, I hope it improves soon!

❤

sir I have a question that at which one field you  study?

🙏🏼🤲❤❤

the sensor you used is an ecg sensor, and the sensor you have in the circuit diagram is an emg sensor, the circuit diagram and the materials you showed in the video don't really match as well, there is no capacitor or reistor in the given circuit diagram, please clarify, and also explain how its detecting all 5 fingers input

Where do you get this all of things pls tell me reply

Good job

i checked his code. i don't think that code can detect individual finger movements. and he's not using enough sensors to contol each finger. the circuit diagram, the code, the materials, nothing matches with the video. a part of me thinks this video is fake. i think he's running the hand on a loop and moving his real hand just at the right time to show as if it's his muscles that's doing the job lol

@trashcorner  same here. i also check the code. its not for individual finger. and sensor is also not for individual finger.

It's fake. He hasn't shown him programming the Atmega or shown any tests with the "ECG" sensor.

Is this fake video? Should I use he code for my project​ @trashcorner

​ @sidharthvmd if I use emg sensor with the code he has given us on he website will it work?

​ @littleneutron2056 can u please answer my questions I will happy if any can help me with this

​ @trashcorner if it can not detect individual finger movement can it detect the hole hend if i use he code? Is it working? Or just a fake code?

Hello can u tell that is this fake video or not ?? Or will the code works if i use emg sensor

@Rimurutempest4533  this video is fake. the code doesn't work at all

u can use ecg

Cool

ie plastic ke tarha white and blue samal kahase layenge??

Can you please tell me how to determine the max and min of muscle sensor using Arduino code?

How did you connect the circuit with Arduino ?

Great work ,i am working on a similar project using the same emg sensor but I have some problems could you help me? Only andwering a few questions of mine ,thank you

You sell?

Think the thumb didnt recieve an invite to the party 🤣 That said, the movements were fluid and dexterous. Well done ! Any chance we could have the electronic signals from a normal human arm be fed to an AI software that can then replicate the same motion ? We could do this for facial expressions too and for each body muscle and movement and end up with a robot which moves with the same fluid grace of a human body.

Answer is simple, you do not, even with 4 channels, it is not that easy to detect individual and combinations of finger flexions. This is most likely a hoax

Why don't you invest on this hand and made it for disabled??

Code on projects page just opens and closes whole hand on a threshold. How do you sense individual fingers? Just multiple thresholds or is it more complicate than that. Can you rise any finger or just them in order? More sensors would let sense individual fingers independently?

Oooooo

Good luck 🤞😃

Unbeleiveable

It had been months since I had started working on microcontrollers like Arduino or nodemcu. Everything was working fine and I was able to understand the concepts. However, there is something every wrong with Engineering community because on one hand they say that it is very easy and any starter can do it but when you start doing the work assembling microcontrollers and its associated components as well as writing code then it takes huge amount of time. Sometimes you have problems choosing the correct part and sometime the code details are bit tricky based on version and sometimes most information is not there online even though you waste ton of time resolving the problem. On the other hand if you search tutorials then finding getting started tutorials is very easy but nobody explains what to do afterwards and how to deal with complex problems. So, basically, it is easy to show the hand and just assemble the components for the purpose of a youtube video but you did the same mistake again. Please make a series on dealing with microcontrollers and let us know how to make good projects from scratch otherwise for me your videos are just eye candy and nothing more. I appreciate your efforts but in no way you are educating the masses. Please make a series that will help us create complex projects like the 'lesics' or 'the infographics show' channel that provide details in scratch.

дай ссылку на 3d model пожалуйста

Great

Hi

Sensor ka nam kaya hay

That was huge delay, wonder why happened

Bhai you are awesome 👍👏😊

Bruhh u took 3 days to write this

@debjanigoswami9716  My brother it is nothing compared to amount of money and time I utilized to learn about IOT.

IoT doesn't have market in India currently In future can't say

@samsameer9291  Watching videos on youtube is very easy. They will show you how easy it is to get started and it is certainly easy if you just want to get started in IOT. But as you try building complex circuits and coding as well as putting everything in practice it will really become difficult both financially as well as utilizing your way trying different programs to make microcontrollers to work. Modules cost is too high in India. You go to Lajpat Rai Market and price of each tiny component is too high in 200 to 400 range. Fingerprint sensor is around 1300 Rs. They will never give you discount until you buy the components in mass. Aa a student it is not possible for a hobbyist to buy components in bulk when even 1 module is very costly. Also, you need different components and not just one type only. I saw the price of components in dollars and rupees. The price of a module in india is same as when converted to rupees or something near to. Imagine if in India we sell packet of lays at the same rate aa they sell in rupees. 4 dollars will be around 250 Rs. and even if retailers offer 1/4th the cost still the consumer will not be able to afford a simple packet of chips. In India problems with IOT are major ones. I worked for 4 to 5 months and it was deeply depressing. I want to continue work on IOT but atleast someone should provide the guidance. I talked to one person and he was charging me 20000 Rs. just to teach basics. I was told to purchase components on my own. Now tell me how can I afford learning IOT when even getting started in IOT is proving costly and also exhausting at the same time?

@radeonblue1816  nothing is easy.. The guy shows about electronics.. But what about neuroscience behind it?... We do know scientists work on different level than YouTubers...

Çok haklı

can u give me the cording?

I am not sure this video is real or not, he is using a ECG sensor but its not possible to do with ECG sensor its should be EMG sensor

@jackyjack9660  Then what is the point of making videos??? Anyone can gets "getting started" tutorial anywhere so nothing special here too.

​ @rafitv7291  this should work if you have a hand, but if you have not, i don't see how it could  work (don't know if I'm right... and could be just a scam)

What engineering course did u do in college?  Pls tell me i want to do like this

Please give me your phone no: i

Genius!!!! The world should invest on technology can help those people who not have a normal life so build something to giving those people a chance to change their life.....  Good job people let us change the world to a better world in the future will come 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗😇😇😇😇😇😇😇

Robot keise banate hie

Make a humanoid

Make a full robot

Sir app ke pass sab kuch hai iss sabko jod ke ek pura ka pura robot banao

What are you gonna do to improve the delay?

Mast

ping 1000 ms

Where we can get the 3D printed hand ??

Amazing

Brother can it work for  "who doesn't have complete forehand ( have hand only  before elbow) ???? This type for start-up will put smile on their face also.

Latency hai yrr bhot

make one video about  code of this  that upload in arduino

chiter ak hat nise arek hat dea korse

Interesting is this working smooth

Довольно интересное устройство. Интересно было бы увидеть как рука работает дистанционно.

Good 👍🏻👍🏻

Bruh, no jobs in hardware field. Take computer science instead.

You can use more processing power and quick connections, with quick hardware. A little software and hardware changes might work. But human hand like quickness is not yet possible.

@rajnisingh8067  not yet

Im also a forehand person 😒

Bhai hamara chennnal haik ho Chuka ha

Hallo bhai hamara chennnal haik ho Chuka h hamre

Are you trying to make a robot Avatar???

Hello, If I'm not wrong about the ic 7805 that you have suggested will supply +5v only. But you told that it will supply 12V, Please go through video once again. Thanku you

You are genius 👏

Nice

Wobderful i like your videos

WITH THAT IN MIND YOU CAN IMPLEMENT IT AND CREATE A REAL "BARITEC" LIKE IN THE "ROBOTEC" SERIES!!!

If we want to work on 12 V we have to use 7812 IC only.

Супер! (Super!) 👏👏👏👍👌🥰😍

Wow that's super cool 😎 keep up the great work...have a great weekend 👍
