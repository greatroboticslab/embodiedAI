00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,000
If you connect the charged capacitor across an inductor, you will see a beautiful energy

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,120
exchange take place between the two elements.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,180
These energy oscillations look as if the capacitor is saying, you take the energy, and the inductor

4
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,500
then says, no, you take my energy.

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,560
Why don't any of these elements store the energy and become settled?

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's have a look at the interesting physics behind these oscillations and some of the

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,940
applications.

8
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:32,300
Before diving into the LC circuit, we need to understand a simple circuit, a capacitor-resistor

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,780
circuit.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,500
The capacitor is fully charged initially.

11
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,120
Let's introduce a resistor into the circuit.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,120
Here you can observe that initially the current flow is at the maximum and then it sharply decays

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,600
with time.

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,020
This is expected because at the beginning the charge difference is at the maximum, so the

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:54,020
current has to be at the maximum.

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,340
Now let's see what will happen if the resistor is replaced with an inductor.

17
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,800
Here again, the capacitor is fully charged initially.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,080
It's quite logical to expect that there will be a huge current flow at the beginning, and

19
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,420
then the current flow would reduce as in the previous case.

20
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,340
However, this will not happen in practice.

21
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,400
An inductor develops EMF across it, based on the change in current flow.

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,340
This means that a drastic change in current is not possible across the inductor as in the

23
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,840
previous case.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,300
Now the current flow starts from zero and increases to the maximum, and then comes back to zero

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,680
again.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,960
In an inductor capacitor circuit, the current flow variation has to be gradual, and here

27
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,880
we can see that the current flow in the LC circuit is shaped like a sine curve.

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,720
Let's look at the electron flow animation once again.

29
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:53,200
The current in the circuit starts from zero and gradually achieves the maximum value.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,200
In the next one quarter of a time period, the current from the capacitor starts to decrease,

31
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,740
resulting in another change in current.

32
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,380
At the end of the capacitor discharge, if you check the EMF across the inductor, it will

33
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:11,200
have the opposite polarity to the initial EMF.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,100
This reverse EMF charges the capacitor with the opposite polarity.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,660
In the next half of the time period, the capacitor will be fully charged with the reverse polarity.

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,880
This also means that the current flow will be in the reverse direction for the next half.

37
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,840
Hence, in an ideal circuit, this back and forth flow of current would continue to charge and

38
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,200
discharge the capacitor and form endless oscillations of energy.

39
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:49,180
However, practically, we can never achieve such ideal behavior due to the presence of resistance.

40
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,800
The resistance causes energy decay in the form of heat.

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,580
This means that in a practical circuit, the oscillations will die out eventually.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,980
As we increase the resistance, the oscillations die out very quickly as shown.

43
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,060
If we increase the resistance further to some critical value, there would be no oscillation

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,940
at all.

45
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:17,200
Underdamped LC circuits have many applications in industry, namely thyristors, magnetrons, etc.

46
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,200
In communication systems, they are an integral part of frequency filters.
