Absolutely love your videos, cannot have enough of them. I am working on my project and your tutorial is essential for me. A BIG THANK YOU

Absolute Legend!

I have watched the whole playlist, Kepp up the Good work sir Thank you so much

Sir my FPS function is giving values in 200 something and it gives this   oneDNN custom operations are on. You may see slightly different numerical results due to floating-point round-off errors from different computation orders. To turn them off, set the environment variable `TF_ENABLE_ONEDNN_OPTS=0`. INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU.

After input return img and run the project, I encounter this issue "Logging before InitGoogleLogging() is written to STDERR". Anyone can help?

where did u get that image file i am stuck at it help me

Hey this code is showing an error

hello guys anyone could tell me where is python interpreter in intellij

can we use vs code?

can someone help   mediapipe package is showing error while downloading

5:16

There seems to be some trouble in creating the module. How to fix that?

I don't know about opencv Library but i could understand everything. Wow how you are good at teaching ❤❤

Do you have anything for C++

def __init__(self, mode=False, maxHands=2, modelComp=1, detectionCon=0.5, trackCon=0.5):         self.mode = mode         self.maxHands = maxHands         self.detectionCon = detectionCon         self.trackCon = trackCon         self.modelComp = modelComp          self.mpHands = mp.solutions.hands         self.hands = self.mpHands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands, self.modelComp, self.detectionCon, self.trackCon)         self.mpDraw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils use this in module file

Hey so i actually tried it  but im actually getting the video at literally 0 FPS  any solutions for that?\ \

Facing an issue list index is out range in findPositions 😢

Actually I am getting error in the self.hands region and the reason for the error is incompatible function arguments can any one help to solve this issue

thank you, thank you very much <3

gigachad 🗿

Thank you

Can we vs code instead of pycharm?

Just Ask Chatgpt....

what does this error mean.. imgRGB = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.7.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor'

if any one is getting error in detectionCon then change its value from 0.75 to 1, it will work

anyone else having trouble installing the mediapipe im getting an error stating that there is no matching distribution found

I am watching this Hand Tracking video and would l like to do this with the new Orange Pi-5.  Do you have some videos using OpenCV with the Orange Pi?  It should be somewhat like the Raspberry Pi? However suggestions would be nice before starting a new project.  😎 Thank you.

hey im facing a problem in installing the mediapipe library ,how can i install it ???? plz reply

I'm getting "AttributeError: 'handDetector' object has no attribute 'Hands'" even if i copy the same code that you wrote :/

that mediapipe package i can't get it works or even installed at all

Your the MAN!!!!!

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

sooo coooooooooooool!!!

great video

where can i see hands.py code

Hloo brother I need help ....i have to submit this small project..or else I won't get marks 😭 I have watched many videos on "Live Face recognition python " But something goes wrong with modules or package don't work sometime or something problem happens.... So please help me with this code please You give me a code which recognises my face ... please brother

Hloo brother

Why we did cx=lm.x*w??

I tried to write code and didn't work. After tried to copy from your website but still didn't work. How can I solve this? Can somebody help or give a  tip

yeah that is what I used

lol

mine runs at around 10fps any fix?

mediapipe is not working i use it in different computer but it is not working

can you put down an open source for the hand tracking module?

its not a virus

even after adding complexity im getting error   img = detector.findHands(img)   line 24, in findHands     imgRGB = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.6.0) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor' can someone pls help

29:56   When you assigned a default value to "detectionCon" and "trackCon" to 0.5 It gave me an error and I debugged to found out that, The value wants to be int, if I converted the 0.5 into an int (like this - int(0.5)) the fps drops to only 2 or so. What can I do Please help

For people getting errors from module and not running, you need to add 1 more parameter to self.mpHands.Hands to fix the issue. It changed with new framework in last update  in init add complexity = 0  parameter (if you want better detection make = 1)  add under other self parameters self.complexity = complexity  lastly self.hands = self.mpHands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands, self.complexity, self.detectionCon, self.trackCon)

Sir i have changed some code in handtracking module in fingersUp() method for thumb # Thumb         if self.lmList[self.tipIds[4] - 3][1] > self.lmList[self.tipIds[0] - 2][1]:             if self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]][1] < self.lmList[self.tipIds[0] - 1][1]:                 fingers.append(1)             else:                 fingers.append(0)         else:             if self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]][1] > self.lmList[self.tipIds[0] - 1][1]:                 fingers.append(1)             else:                 fingers.append(0) You can add this so that fingers up work properly if we flip our hands

sir  can i get this code currently i am not getting the code from the given link

sir i am facing error ( Invoked with: 0.5) can u please tell me about that.

@37:19 a timestamp for me

cap = cv2.Videocapture(0) AttributeError: module 'cv2' has no attribute 'Videocapture' how to fix this issue?

before 1 day looking for a app that work, finally i found

I am running into error: AttributeError: 'handDetector' object has no attribute 'hands' any help?

Thanks to all for pointing out the 'model_complexity' issue.  I added it to the method _init_ and was able to get it to work now.

My laptop is giving max 13 fps and screaming. lol

For anyone who may be looking at this video recently, it looks as though you may need to add a new parameter to the .Hands method.  "model_complexity", otherwise you may get an error.  (I was), after maxHands just add 1 as an extra parameter (Unless you need to modify this)

For those who are getting error on inits in module creation....add model_complexity to the parameters and the error will be solved

Make detection conf as 1 instead 0.5

Thanks so much, it works

@jazztyanatandroid4909  bro can you please share the file link here its not working

@manishkumar-vz6bw  There's no any link bro, you just need to add the code like mentioned above

Thank you, it works

C is capital letter

I added modelcomplexity in _init_ but still not working for me

@belcamara4874  oh sorry, for init it's double under.    Like this   "__init__" . Not single _init_.  For some reason YouTube isn't showing the first underscore.  So two underscores in front and back.....  Now it shows... Hope you understood.

Error resolved after adding model Complexity. Thanks.

can u please explain more cause ive been trying to and nothing is working

@zachytg4227  add extra parameter in _ init _  put “model_complexity”. Then your problem will be solved. Thank You….

@zachytg4227  man

@zachytg4227  same here man

thank you so much

hi can you please share your updated code

@animeshbiswas2967  but how do I add it specifically, could you show a code example?

@ruchir gupta bro, did you solve all errors? If you solve it can you share the updated code, please

plz share the code

@desocrate  Use this     def __init__(self, mode=False, maxHands=2, modelComp=1, detectionCon=0.5, trackCon=0.5):         self.mode = mode         self.maxHands = maxHands         self.detectionCon = detectionCon         self.trackCon = trackCon         self.modelComp = modelComp          self.mpHands = mp.solutions.hands         self.hands = self.mpHands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands, self.modelComp, self.detectionCon, self.trackCon)         self.mpDraw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

i have error with detection Con  whats the problem ?

@SwastikSaha1204  a savior my man

@SwastikSaha1204  The error is solved but the video lags for some reason with 0 fps

@SwastikSaha1204  appreciate so much!

thank  you very much. i struggled alot finally read the commets, its worked

thank you bro  @SwastikSaha1204

Thanku bro

thanks a lot

Still got a problem with the mlList that can’t find the valute needed

took me a while to figure out what happened here, but this solved in not time. You have truely saved the day!

​ @raysyu4330  Are you done making the entire project? If so please ping me if you are interested in selling.

Thanks

​ @SwastikSaha1204 But how this resolved it Please explain it 🙏

Thank you ​ @SwastikSaha1204

@SwastikSaha1204  thank you so much man

Thank u

@dreamwork69  Bro Code Please

Sir my video is not running continously what may be the error it just displaing one image.

F*ck you I spent 4 hours on this bullcrap your code is broken.

your code is not running now

I believe there is an error in your code. in the function "findPosition" line  "myHand = self.results.multi_hand_landmarks[handNo]" i changed to " for myHand in self.results.multi_hand_landmarks:" , I also changed " if draw" to "if draw and id ==handNo" and now I can specify which node is being drawn whereas before all nodese were colored and i do not get an error if I change "handNo" to any value higher than 0

how can i just have a bouding box of hand using mediapipe

Whenever I am calling this module to another program it is showing error in last two line that is if name = main Main().  Plz tell me how i remove these error. I need to sort it out urgently. Plz reply

Are there any changes from mediapipe? Unfortunately, this library cannot be installed:   "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mediapipe' "  during installation ( pip install mediapipe) abd  via PyCharm:  ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe

Hey, i have done that project, including all the other projects of yours based on the Hand tracking Module, but my question is, why it takes more than 2-3 minutes to run my code, i have a good PC and i dont get it, yours runs almost instantly ^_^

it works fine but for me it takes arround 2 min to open up the camera window, how can i make it faster ? i have a good computer though

Sir i am getting this error can please help me............................................................... cv2.imshow("Image", img) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.5) D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor'

Thanks much Murtaza...thinking about making a Magic Mirror and adding all this automation...i guess you should be able to select stuff on the screen with gestures ?

I use raspberry pi and i have 2-4 fps :(  What can i do?

Tnx for video 💎🖤 Why i cant import cv2 in raspberry?

Me entenderán en español?🤔 No me deja compilar el código si tengo instalado Mediapipe si la desinstalo si compila el cv2, una ayudita?

Pls help me my handTracking module    error. Pls help me

i am also facing the same issue plz help

​ @Aniruddh Sharma   Add a third parameter called modelComplexity. I think they have updated the mediapipe library, hence the issues. It started working after I added the parameter.

@normalhuman6260  thanks buddy it work for me 😄😄

@normalhuman6260  thanks sir. It really helped me out.

The code is not working. I also copied from the cvzone site, still no result. Help me.

I am getting this error:  [ WARN:0@0.627] global D:\a\opencv-python\opencv-python\opencv\modules\videoio\src\cap_msmf.cpp (539) `anonymous-namespace'::SourceReaderCB::~SourceReaderCB terminating async callback Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Python\main.py", line 78, in <module>     main()   File "C:\Python\main.py", line 58, in main     detector = handDetector()   File "C:\Python\main.py", line 21, in _init_     self.hands = self.mpHands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands,   File "C:\Python\venv\lib\site-packages\mediapipe\python\solutions\hands.py", line 114, in _init_     super().__init__(   File "C:\Python\venv\lib\site-packages\mediapipe\python\solution_base.py", line 258, in _init_     self._input_side_packets = {   File "C:\Python\venv\lib\site-packages\mediapipe\python\solution_base.py", line 259, in <dictcomp>     name: self._make_packet(self._side_input_type_info[name], data)   File "C:\Python\venv\lib\site-packages\mediapipe\python\solution_base.py", line 513, in _make_packet     return getattr(packet_creator, 'create_' + packet_data_type.value)(data) TypeError: create_int(): incompatible function arguments.

10 -15 MINUTES THE VIDEo IS NEARLY AN HOUR LONG

So you can achieve around a 100fps using a proper programming language (C++) 😜

There is a thing of the past that images twitches like that, 10 years from then same problem, TWITCH EXISTS

what do you do after buying a mechanical keyboard https://youtube.com/shorts/FF0lELbLD8g?feature=share

why i have errorr when i try to open camera

Can't believe it, first app run and it does not work :D typical programming issue, - even if there are all required package installed already, it does work ...

Hi sir the video was very useful. Can you also tell how to run it through  a Gpu for increased performance

which algorithm is being used here???

Can you make a project in which physical contact is detected such as if 2 people make a handshake or hug each other then it detects it and shows it with a red bounding box. Very good tutorial, subscribed

맙소사 알고리즘님 감사합니다

I can't get past 13 lines of code because of this message:  success, img + cap.read() NameError: name 'success' is not defined INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU.  Help would be appreciated.

from mediapipe.python._framework_bindings import resource_util ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _framework_bindings: The specified module could not be found. I got this error can anyone suggest me a solution

Nice

Hello. If we look at the beginning, I wrote the same code for using the camera on my laptop (i used cv2.VideoCapture(0)) but the indow wouldnt show up. Any ideas why?  Thanks in advance.

FND GO OUT OF THIS CORPSE

4:10 - amazing coming out

its a big jump from console programs to this

i find solution when we define class:  def __init__(self, mode=False,maxHands=2,detectionCon=0.5,trackCon=0.5): we miss i argument (i think they added it after this video) it should look like this: def __init__(self, mode=False,maxHands=2,complex=1,detectionCon=0.5,trackCon=0.5): and in the next lines: self.hands = self.mpHands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands, self.complex,                                         self.detectionCon, self.trackCon)

@gabenfreeman9936  Dude Really  I owe You a lot I wish you achieve what u are willing for

@HelloWorld-vr5dw  can u please share the codes with me I am unable to solve my errors

@gabenfreeman9936   Jazakallah khairan. Thanks a lot

did you get the solution?

Great tutorial!! Thank you!!

great channel

I'm having trouble with the findPosition method where it only works with one hand. I would like to track coordinates of the tip of the index finger, lmList[8], for both left and right hand. The method only works with one hand at a time so I tried initializing a second list, lmList2 = detector.findPosition(img, handNo=1) but I'm getting a "list index out of range" with handNo being anything not equal 0. What should I do to track coordinates of the second hand at the same time?

pls tell me that you have fixed it..

Did you find the solution??

did you solve this? im interested in doing this too

Thank you for the good video! I have a question sir  How can we enhance the detecting accuracy of the fingertip?? Most of the times it finds the fingertip well, but sometimes it doesn't I would appreciate if you tell me the solutions

great really

Bro why is it lagging? I write all in right information.. and when self.DetectCon and self.TrackCon is a non-integer it gives an error so I put int() but it lag please notice me thank you.

Hi I'm also using pycharm but when I run hands.process in the while loop (following your steps in the video), my fps drops from 30 to 10. Do you know what could be potentially causing it?

Sir could u please tell me I have an error during mediapipe installation saying that " could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe(from version : none)  I have tried to upgrade but it's working please give me a solution

Excellent content. Thanks for sharing

Did you find solution to the problem I am having same problem

Me too. The same problem at the same point :(

Sameeee

Any fixes you came across later @Ryan?

@vishwas9778  unfortunately no..

Try using python 3.7.6

He uses pycharm community

@murtazasworkshop  didnt expect that You will answer! Thanks!

This info was so helpful Thanks

Thank you!

I added model complexity within the class and that worked for me! The code becomes as follow:  class handDetector():     def __init__(self, mode=False, maxHands=2, modelComplexity=1,  detectionCon=0.5, trackCon=0.5):         self.mode = mode         self.maxHands = maxHands         self.modelComplex = modelComplexity         self.detectionCon = detectionCon         self.trackCon = trackCon          self.mpHands = mp.solutions.hands         self.hands = self.mpHands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands, self.modelComplex, self.detectionCon, self.trackCon)         self.mpDraw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils

can we do this project in atom?

Im getting " validated_graph.initialize( FileNotFoundError: The path does not exist.**" can someone help me ?

Sir, it would be highly beneficial, if you explain the image stacking function you personally made, in the "open cv in 3 hrs" video.

Enjoying this tutorial.  For some reason, my version of hands.py has a fifth parameter called "model_complexity" after "max_num_hands".  I had to insert that into the class handDetector and in the self.hands definition.

can someone help me? I have an error when I want to run the module starting from main() and an error in the hands attribute in handDetector. sorry i'm a beginner

hi, im trying to get an executable output of this project but i get an error of none existing path of solution in mediapipe and the .exe doesnt run. could you create a video of how to create a .exe file from these kind of projects like hand detections?

you might have saved my graduation project damn

Sir my web camera opens lately can you suggest what to do sir???

hey I've been doing this with python 3.7.9 and it's showing some error in handtracking module.Can someone help me regarding this?It would be great if someone help me regarding this.

mediapipe “error occurred with installing mediapipe ”

I wrote the exactly same code but my output only shows "Process finished with exit code 0" and no output window. @Murtaza's Workshop ,what is wrong here? I even copied your code in the description box but it also showed same result.

I m just a beginner in python so how much should I learn python tho start this project .. ?? Can anyone pls answer 🤍🤍

The code works well but making class based modules cause errors. Anyone else?

i have a problem here. i`ve done the module, i`ve check my webcam, i`ve wrote the def main(), and the videocapture. my module won`t pop up an image a.k.a the video, just coordinate informations printed on the result. what should i do then?

https://youtu.be/LThANuf5zg4

what is this aplication from coding?

I am getting an error  while the run function in 36 th minute.  Error is  AttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'hands'

how to make a voice when I raise my finger, for example: put out 1 a finger and say "one".hope you reply

I would be able to follow the tutorial and gets the exact same result as yours. Hats of to you man.

Please reply someone its really really urgent 😢

in which software are you making this project?

@saiyanwarrior7922  um using windows, and the vscode

thankyou this helped!❤️

that took me a hot minute to figure out. I'm here to figure out how to mirror the whole thing now so my display matches my gestures. I figured that answer must be in the comments somewhere.

that helped me with my error thanks

It seems that the latest mediapipe has an additional parameter to the hands attribute called model complexity. I am not completely sure what it is, but it takes an integer value, which can be 0 or 1, and the default value is 1. While initializing the handDetector class, make sure to include this as a parameter between the maxHands=2 and detectionCon=0.5 as a name like modelComplexity=1  def __init__(self, mode=False, maxHands=2, modelComplexity=1, detectionCon=0.5, trackCon=0.5):         self.mode = mode         self.maxHands = maxHands         self.modelComplexity = modelComplexity         self.detectionCon = detectionCon         self.trackCon = trackCon          self.mphands = mp.solutions.hands         self.hands = self.mphands.Hands(self.mode, self.maxHands, self.modelComplexity, self.detectionCon,  self.trackCon)         self.mpDraw = mp.solutions.drawing_utils   The above code segment contains the changes I explained earlier. That should most probably fix the error you might be having.

@ahmedhamdi1234  Thanks a lot......It worked... ❣️🤞

Same problem, how to resolve it?

"cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)"' make it 0 here instead of 1

Yes same here

did you get solutions

And learn the jeston nano ?

Should we buy jeston nano kit for this ?

Is it possible to do this type of programming for Horse Legs? Here you are using Hands lib. If possible, how can I proceed with that?

I have a question!!!! I am trying to get second hand landmarks data, but if there is no hands or one hand in the screen then it crahses and shows error that list get out of index. Can we try to get both hand landmarks? by just changing handNo. parameter?

This tutorial was really helpful, can u do one for stereoscopic cameras as well.

Why my hand connections are white in colour and not green .

How i can use it for VRChat?

Excellent explanation and understandable content. Thanks.

ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe==0.8.0 (from versions: none) ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe I am getting an error plz help

Oh hoho THAT's cool!

after copying your code given on the website iam still getiing error it does not show in the problem menu and after running it it gives problem the error message is    [ WARN:0] global C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-req-build-sn_xpupm\opencv\modules\videoio\src\cap_msmf.cpp (438) `anonymous-namespace'::SourceReaderCB::~SourceReaderCB terminating async callback Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Users\Gandhaar\PycharmProjects\fonger conter\HandTrakingModule.py", line 71, in <module>     main()   File "C:\Users\Gandhaar\PycharmProjects\fonger conter\HandTrakingModule.py", line 54, in main     img = detector.findHands(img)   File "C:\Users\Gandhaar\PycharmProjects\fonger conter\HandTrakingModule.py", line 19, in findHands     imgRGB = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.3) C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-req-build-sn_xpupm\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor'  INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU.

can you plz share the module code cuz it seems to not work but it work for like 1 minutes an next time i tried an did not work idk what is the problem plz share the code of module cuz on the website of yours there is no code of the module and your allmost all next videos are depented on that module so plz if your reading this like this so it gettes on the top and the developer of this channel can see this plz i am not writeing this for time pass i really need this so plz

Not many people do such video... That too with so much detail and explanation.. You have my subscription 👍🏻

what r  your pc specs

Wow

my fps = 0... the image remains stil how can i solve this?

Hi Murtaza, Firstly i would like to thank, you are genius :D But i Have a problem  import cv2 import mediapipe as mp import time   cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) mpHands = mp.solutions.hands hands = mpHands.Hands() while True:     success, img = cap.read()     imgRGB = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)     results = hands.process(imgRGB)      cv2.imshow("Image", img)     cv2.waitKey(1)  and I got errors,.. :(  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:/.../, line 8, in <module>     hands = mpHands.Hands()   File "C:/.../", line 125, in _init_     outputs=['multi_hand_landmarks', 'multi_handedness'])   File "C:\...", line 238, in _init_     binary_graph_path=os.path.join(root_path, binary_graph_path)) FileNotFoundError: The path does not exist What is wrong?

For multiple hands its better to follow this new method https://youtu.be/3xfOa4yeOb0

@murtazasworkshop  Thank you so much, I just figure it out and use same nested loops that we use in find position function. It's working.. 😃  I will definately watch your new method video to see what's your solution is.  Thanks again!

did u get the solution?

alot of people are getting this error please help

When we draw the circles at certain point IDs @25:30 I get the circles an inch below the the exact point where it should ideally be. Is anyone facing the same issue? How do I resolve it , help!!? @everyone @Murtaza

I am getting ~30fps without detecting hand position (i.e basically showing image from camera) but when I enable detection fps drops to 10 is it hardware issue or can I improve somehow?

Module file not working

First part was a great intro 👍 The second "module" was a good idea but please try sticking with python's code conventions. Thanks and keep making more videos  like this!

You, Mr. Murtaza, you are my idol for doing this kind of videos. Thank you.

I from Brazilian and a start learning Lange progamation on 2021 and I love It. Thanks

hi can this connect to vseeface ? if it can how to connect it?

Nice video, thanks :)

you are very talented...keep making more videos...i watched more than 10 videos in 2 days

What happens if I don't have findposition?

AttributeError: module 'cv2.cv2' has no attribute 'COLOR_RBG2RBG' pls help

Great video, however, I would stick with python naming convention.

Hello, love the channel from Kenya, quick question though....at 9:40 when testing if the image is being processed, why didn't you pass variable results into cv2.imshow() function instead of variable img???

Can I use this app for vr

your source is empty

@oskarz  mate i have the modules installed, though?

​ @oskarz  how to solve it then,?

I figured it out, It was happening due to TLP. After disabling TLP fps went up to 25 from 10. Also I something strange on system monitor  When using TLP my fps was 10 and my cpu usage (all 4 cores) was around 50% (40-60 range). Disabling TLP my fps went up to 25 but my cpu usage also went down around 40% (range to become confined 35 to 45).  Is TLP not working fine? How should I interpret this data

any solution?

Already define in video

what don't you like? I'm learning python from these videos as much as I'm learning openCV. I don't want to pick up bad habits. I grew up on C (and still wish every language was C)

it should be COLOR_BGR2RGB not COLOR_RBG2RBG

I uninstalled and installed again opencv-python, and it worked

Iam geting import error on mediapipe

so if i want to have opencv to track face movement and features, like eyes nose mouth movement. i need to make each points on end?

thank you so much! I've been trying to make it to where I could memify my webcam by making it so that i could teach a very simple model the substitution naruto jutsu and make it so when i did the hand signs it would make me dissapear from camera. Thank you so much

It's amazing 🤟

thank you so much

Amazing video. Loved your clarity and procedure of teaching. Subscribed <3

Best ever explanation. Specially while explaining the parameters and not simply writing them out.

which version of python and pycharm did you use? because im using python 3.7 and i tried installing mediapipe 0.8.6 and 0.8.3.1. I get the error message saying "coud not find the version that satisfies the requirement". Any help would be appreaciated

19:00

It’s the worst way to create a module bro use a class like it’s only for creating instances why go searching for places to write code

the code in your website is printing values for all the landmarks can you plz look into that and correct the code

So instead of webcams, what would you put for programs that output video/stream such as ps4 remote play?.

Bro can you give me the code plz

Do you have any experience on smoke detection with opencv?

The project was amazing however, I was wondering if both hands can be listed for lm properties currently, it detects both hands but only provides lmList details for one. Also, it can't differentiate between right and left hand any methods for the same would be super helpful. Thank you. @Murtaza's Workshop

Hey Guys  @Murtaza I'm facing an error due to this command "cv2. imshow ('Image' , img)  cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.2) C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-req-build-k1ohfcms\opencv\modules\highgui\src\window.cpp:404: error: (-215:Assertion failed) size.width>0 && size.height>0 in function 'cv::imshow'  No error when I comment out the above line (no image of course when the above line is off)  I checked with opencv  reinstalled using anaconda,

Get the hand tracker module here instead: https://www.computervision.zone/courses/hand-tracking/lesson/handtrackingmodule-py-2 The one from the video description has corrupted indentation.

sir,  at the time to run module it shows many error , though i have checked the code thrice it does't work

i am begginer so i copy this code and paste in openvc same version but it will show error   " imgRGB = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.1) C:\Users\appveyor\AppData\Local\Temp\1\pip-req-build-oduouqig\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor'  INFO: Created TensorFlow Lite XNNPACK delegate for CPU."  anyone can solve this problem

Lol

same :'(

Use cvzone package it has all the features

@murtazasworkshop  Thank you. I'll definitely check it out.

This also unable to load

Do you know anyways of getting it to calculate the distance between the camera and one of the id points?

Which software is this (plz reply)

Thank you sir. Please help me out.

there are more than 1 lakh people in a single programming channel that means competition is tough phew..

FYI, I found someone who kindly packaged this for jetson nano and raspberry pi. I get a couple of errors, but it seems to work. I just got to the point of the video where we draw the lines to connect the landmarks, and it seems to be working perfectly.   Thanks a lot for the lessons!

What could I do if I would like to add the elbow joint as well? in other words it would track the hand and extend to the elbow??

What is the code editor? I am unable to accomplish anything with VS studio

ydik menq el krnanq

Thank you for your good video.  I have a question about FPS. I made a demo like you, but I only got about 12~15 FPS. Does this FPS number depend on my camera or my PC ?? How can I increase FPS over 30 FPS??

Hi, amazing project, and that about capture from more than one cameras for more beatiful results?

awsome! how about using this to teach kids typewriting skils. example if you type the q with your index it does not print the character but complain that you mist use your pinkie

sir I am unable to get the output and I am getting an error like this what should I do>???     imgRGB = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB) cv2.error: OpenCV(4.5.2) C:\Users\runneradmin\AppData\Local\Temp\pip-req-build-sgoydvi3\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor pls reply sir!! I have a project to do

at cv2 there is error coming

Great share your results on the Discord Channel

@murtazasworkshop    Sure, I will get around to signing up soon.

Also me! When I run the program I get fps = 0… the image remains still.🥺 Did you fix it in some way? Thanks

I have the same issue on both my 2019 iMac and my 2020 MacBook Air M1. Were you ever able to fix it?

Fps depends on your camera

Hey i am having issues in installing the mediapipe package in pycharm it says that    Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for mediapipe  Please anyone can help me ?

okay. now build it from scratch

my question is in the line where you are converting ratio to pixel value, what does x and y mean?

What is your editor and can I do it in visual studio code??

On which Programm you Are wtiting ?

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)       # If you have only one webcam, then (0)

Email please

How about a turtorial on vr hands?

Thanks Hassan u r awesome dude!!!

Assalam O Alikum. Brother murtaza, please guide me how to install mediapipe on jetson nano as I am struggling for weeks to make it run on nano. Please help me on this. Thanks

Great video!  Thanks,

Hey Hassan great video!!!! but i get this error: ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _framework_bindings: The specified module could not be found. what should I do??

when i try to enumerate id,lm the kernel connection breaks :/

This blowed my mind, Absolutely stunning!! Thanks lot sir for sharing your knowledge.

I love you bro

When I go to add the interpreter opencvpython is not coming what shall I do...?

Brilliant! Thank you so much for sharing this topic. The way you explain this topic is very professional and accessible. Keep up your good work!

Sir i am getting  float divisible by zero how to deal with it

try this brother: cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) probably you are using only one cam

@AKSHAY ABRAHAM yeah dude i resolved that error...

Try 3.7

@спидиfnシ︎ it worked for me bruh you have to have python 3.7 and pycharm community version

x and y represent the coordinates in the displayed window. i.e x will be between 0 to 1 along the width and y will be between 0 to 1 along the height of the displayed window.

yes same with me...did you find any solution ?

@dhruvsharma2k  Yah Bro try these methods: 1) by reinstalling the modules and packages (mediapipe and  cv2) 2) make sure u r installing the latest version of packages IMPORTANT 3)install the c++ virtual Microsoft env. (make sure it's 2019 to 2015 ver.) The last one worked for me!!

@ezzeldin101  yaa already done with it...last one worked for me.

@dhruvsharma2k  Good luke!!

opencv-python is correct one

amazing tutorial brother!!! OMG from start to finish with detailed explination!!  You're AMAZING brother!! plz continue sharing with us more amazing projects and videos like that all the time!

Sir we need you're  help   we use you're  project volume gesture control     but sir we confused   when  run handtracking  module  why it is say  created tensorflow lite using xnnn delegate  ?is  tensorflow lite is   backend ???we are confused what is front and back end of this project .

Wow . I`m really appreciated for you to upload these wonderful video thx !

brother thank you soo much with your help i am able to use opencv and hand gesture like a pro thank you soo much bro you will hit 10 million till 2023 i am sure (not writing so i can get a heart my heart voice say this about the chanell

32:40 im i the only one doesnt understand this or im alone

What a useful content Appreciate your work sir Thank you very much <3

This is the right tutorial I was expecting... Thank you so much👍👍👍👍👍

I have created module using this tutorial. Its working but the camera window isn't showing up. Please help me out...

thank you so much

i'm getting this error no idea why..... results = self.hands.process(imgRGB) AttributeError: 'handDetector' object has no attribute 'hands'

how can we make it go further ..like Play pause vlc, fast forward , etc and use in Google maps as zoom in zoom out and move maps using gesture ?

What a fabulous channel ! Keep up the good works brother.

Hi, i am getting "Divide by zero" error on fps calculation sometimes. How to clear out this?

Great pedagogy! Instructive and helpful. Thank you Murtaza!

why is his hand tracking so much smoother?

Where can i download that HandTrackingModule?

HandTrackerModule is not indented properly...its common problem in his all hand tracking codes

I have the same two first errors

I also got this problem, how can u solve this.Please send me some information

@buinhatquan724  self.result

@tanmaysinghal8370     I've already fix like u said, but it still do not work   File "C:/Users/MSI GL65/Desktop/Youtube project/Hands Recognition/Old_HandTrackingModule.py", line 19, in findHands     self.results = self.hands.process(imgRGB) AttributeError: 'handDetector' object has no attribute 'hands'

Navigate to the part responsible for the printing of the FPS values on the screen and make an exception so that if the two subtracted values are equal the result won't be 0; something crude will work as well e.g., if value1 = value2 then value 1 = value 2 + 1.  It has been a long while since I last played around with it so I cant recall which variables I edited - I only remember they are located at the part where the printing of the FPS is done.

really very nice and amazing tutorial 😍❤💕

thumps up 😊😊😍

Hi , Thanks, How can I detect if it is left or right hand ?

Great !!!!

good afternoon, I have a problem, when I put the i run the code of the minute 9:44 returns the following error:   [ WARN:0] global C:\Users\appveyor\AppData\Local\Temp\1\pip-req-build-wvn_it83\opencv\modules\videoio\src\cap_msmf.cpp (434) `anonymous-namespace'::SourceReaderCB::~SourceReaderCB terminating async callback Traceback (most recent call last):   File "C:\Users\Usuário\PycharmProjects\HandTracking\HandTracking.py", line 7, in <module>     hands = mpHands.Hands()   File "C:\Users\Usuário\PycharmProjects\HandTracking\venv\lib\site-packages\mediapipe\python\solutions\hands.py", line 129, in _init_     super().__init__(   File "C:\Users\Usuário\PycharmProjects\HandTracking\venv\lib\site-packages\mediapipe\python\solution_base.py", line 220, in _init_     validated_graph.initialize( FileNotFoundError: The path does not exist.

Hey, great video. I'm using this tutorial to figure out how to move the cursor using finger tracking. Right now I'm using the index finger to move the cursor and it works fine, I'm using pywin32 module to set the cursor using the index finger's tip landmark.  One thing I'm not being able to figure out is how do I manipulate the sensitivity of the cursor. I don't want to move my finger across the whole screen to move the cursor from one edge to the other. This is how I set the cursor:   landmark ratio (for example 0.5 if at middle of screen) multiplied by 1920 (width of my screen). I feel like I'm missing something really obvious and simple but after a few hours of trying to manipulate the sensitivity,  I thought perhaps you have an idea about how to achieve this.

bro i have learned a lot of great things from this video, thankyou so much brother, pls keep uploading such kinds of videos

Hi, demo look impressively! What's the  core model here? I would like to read futher detail, is there any paper for this work? Thanks!

Fantastic tutorial!! Do you happen to know why the main function is executed on one hand only?

thanks man. You are great!! I'm getting very low fps. How do I fix this!

i am a cv2 noobs. Fortunately, i learn linux this year. But i want to know why i can only install mediapipe by pip in linux ,i can`t install it by windows ,when i try it ,the pip tell me "No matching distribution found for mediapipe", please help me.thinks ：）

Really man great job, and thanks a lot for this enthralling tutorial

how can i print the landmarks of both the hands at the same time?

error: (-215:Assertion failed) size.width>0 && size.height>0 in function 'cv::imshow'  Can you solve this error? its in the beginning when asked to capture camera.

Dll import error is coming what to do?

excellent, practical tutorial! I've subscribed :)

Seen this channel for the first time. I love it already!

Thank you so much for this wonderful project!! Please keep on posting such content, you are really talented! :D

Its posible that cant use mediapipe in python 3.8 ? Get error deprecated when trying to add to the project

Very nice tutorial .What is the use of Z coordinates that appear in each point ?

If you still haven't found something I think this may help.  Find an optimal constant and multiply the cursor distance traveled with your finger distance traveled that may solve the problem  Optimal_constant_x = screen_resolution_x/cam_resolution_x  Same for "y" also

Also me! When I run the project I see the fps = 0 and the image remains still… did you fix that in some way? Thankssss

You’re welcome

​ @murtazasworkshop I have error in hand tracking module

call the method twice or update the method

@murtazasworkshop  sir, can you please tell me where I need to change exactly? I tried but I couldn't.

MediaPipe supports Python 3.6 to 3.8. You should try downgrading your python version.

@wtfisthis4587  Aparently was a issue about using a 32 bits version of python interpreter . Used the 64 bits and worked fine.

HELP  ! .....not able to install mediapipe   ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe

I am unable to download codes from your website please help me to download the codes

Hi bro, Great series but I am facing a small issue - unable to install mediapipe package, getting "ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe". I am using the below versions Mac OS Mojave 10.14.6 ;; Python 3.7 ;; Pip 21.0.1. Can you please help?

(-215:Assertion failed) size.width>0 && size.height>0 in function 'cv::imshow'......I am getting this error...Pls help

so that's hwo those dance games are made on xbox

bro showing error in installing mediapipe ...... /Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe/ how can i solve that my python version is 3.8.3

What is the algorithm or model that you use to extract the marker point of finger?

You don't have to add "if results.multi_hand_landmarks" before looping it. If there's none it will skip by default.

Can we save inputs for gestures like I can command python to do something when my index finger is up?

So basically - load the module that already do that for you

Great video, but project run with error: "from mediapipe.python._framework_bindings import resource_util ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.". Same reported by many visitors here, so it would be good to give us solution for this. I checked and everything is configured like in your project (Python 3.7, OpenCV same version, mediapipe same version, other packages same). Thanks.

Why don't they use this for VIRTUAL REALITY? Damn why do big companies waste money to sell us overexpensive plastic controllers?

Dear Murtaza perfect tutorial. I have found everything I was looking for. Thanks

DLL load failed while importing _framework_bindings: The specified module could not be found. this is what error is showing any one please help me...

I have installed the mediapipe package successfully and while importing the mediapipe module it is showing an error ERROR IS : ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.  please let me know the solution to it?

fps = 1/(cTime-pTime) ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero     I got  this error few minutes later when I run the  code. How to overcome this error. Can I use some try and except block to overcome this ????

thanks for this video

I've gone all the way through successfully, but now it continues to to say  "Process finished with exit code 0" without opening the webcam.   I've even copied and pasted the code just to make sure. Can someone help?  I'm using PyCharm 2018.3.7 (Community Edition)

Very nice tutorial

Thanks for a nice video  But the module code from your website is not working

try to update ur python version to python3

You have Python 3.9 or a newer version, which is not supported yet. MediaPipe can support only or in between Python 3.6 to 3.8. Try to install 3.7.8 or something like that.

I have python 3.7 only

I'm getting the same error and I don't know how to solve it

@wtfisthis4587  thanks man :)

Good practice / discretion

Solved this error after installed "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" (can be found on microsoft support site).

@BabaCAD  I have use this but it is not working for me . Can you help over this .

@ayushityagiayushi7043  If you have the same error like I had "ImportError: DLL load failed" and install of "Microsoft Visual C++ Redist 2015-2019" didn't help you, I don't know what else you can do. In my case it resolved this error and I can run the project w/o errors.

oculus has started experimenting with only using hands but currently its kind of buggy and not reliable so the controllers are much better than just hands

Glad to hear that

Install "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" (can be found on microsoft support site).

@BabaCAD  ok, thanx I will try

Install "Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019" and problem is solved.

use time.time() at the start of the while loop as well and then subtract that instead

@murtazasworkshop  ok

try using webcam 0 instead of 1

Have you solved the issue?

Amazing video!!! thanks for the tutorial! can you kindly suggest me how can i increase FPS in my laptop webcam its near 6-7 fps

Greate video, helped me a lot. I am trying to crop the hand after detecting it ( if one hand crop it if 2 hands crop both hands as one image) any idea how to do this?

Hello sir, great video  btw i wanted to ask if u are into game development or not. If yes then pls make a video or a course on game development. Request from a small fan❤️

Awesome video as always. Love this channel

cTime = time.time() fps = 1 / (cTime  - pTime) pTime = cTime this gives me an error saying pTime is not defined

That cooll

Greeeeat. It works.

33:35

Can you please make a video on installing Mediapipe on Ubuntu or Windows? It would be really helpful. I want to work with Mediapipe, but I can't get it working.

Got most of it working, thanks! I'm getting an error when trying to run the module after importing it: OpenCV(4.4.0) C:\Users\appveyor\AppData\Local\Temp\1\pip-req-build-52oirelq\opencv\modules\imgproc\src\color.cpp:182: error: (-215:Assertion failed) !_src.empty() in function 'cv::cvtColor' The module runs perfectly on its own, but not when it's imported. Any ideas how I can fix this?

First of all, I would like to thank you for all the amazing content you have shared with us consistently. You have great content, it's clear and you share the code, examples, and all the content. I have joined your discord server registered on your website for many courses you have there. Also, download many examples from your Github. I don't know how you manage to do so much and answer questions etc. I would like to thank you and encourage you to keep it up Murtaza. One day I wish to learn how to make a classifier that detects multiple good objects and scans for bad defects on them like loose stitches etc. Before that code makes a raspberry pi GPIO trigger a relay to tell a conveyor to stop.... hint...lol. Even if you don't cover this in the future, I will still wait for the notification bell that lets me know when you upload. Your videos are great.

can you make a video about sign language detection..

Do you get higher framerates when you put the I/O operations on other threads?

thank you teacher :D

Sir I have problem on downloading in mediapipe library. It is showing such errors. ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe

I am not able to find github link for source code. Can you please share the link again for this project.. thank you

Hi..i'm selling jewelry on ecommerce. Planning to add function opencv to detect finger, then embed rings pic. Its possible?

You're a fantastic genius!

Can you use gpu too?

Can you help me?  File "C:/Users/Ba Linh/PycharmProjects/Handtracking/HandtrackingModul.py", line 54, in main     img = detector.findHands(img) TypeError: findHands() missing 1 required positional argument: 'img'

Same with me

@lalitkumarsharma2003        # Required to use webcam of the device.(s3,s4)     cv2.imshow("Image", img) # waitkey() waits until a key is pressed here (q) to exit from creating continuous frames.     if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):  # very important if you want a continuous array of frames         break  Use this code at end of while loop so that you will capture video instead of pictures and your fps will increase. You can also use multi-threading etc, but this worked for me.

Same here the situation is... I had downloaded and installed the mediapipe module as it's mentioned in the video, during executing the code it's showing me DLL error the specific module is not found.

pip install mediapipe

@CodeWithJoe  I did this one too, still same error is I'm getting

@abhiruppeeyalsinha5376  yeh.. Me too have same problem.

Download .whl file of the module and install it using pip

@FleetNine  can you write the command pls

Try this: cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) you might be using only one webcam

Have u solved it?

@theryze.  ok

@dipinadhikari9549   you need to used python 3.7 not 3.8, 3.9; mediapipe isn't available for those

@jhondavidson2049  ok thanks

me too

I think you forgot to write "img" when you defined findHands  Also, check if you wrote the functions name in same case everywhere

I have the same error in the "MyNewGameHandTraking" part

how can run on GPU

hi, very interesting. Will in the future be a human body tracking tutorial? Thank you

I'm a beginer and your tutorials are greats and so explicite. Thank's a lot.

Excellent video, very well explained

Thank you sir. I am working on a small project exactly on this. Your tutorial helps a lot.

Cool stuff

Amazing, thnx for sharing

Op....

I've just came here to listen the intro and see that girl from it :)

Nice video! Please, make a video on real time human pose estimation too.

sir can you make an ai like jarvis

This channel is so underrated!!  I'm sure this channel will hit 1 million within short time if other coders know about it.

Really truly top video ! I wonder how to use it as a Leap motion alternative.  Hassan you're a killer.  ;)

Does anyone know how I can install mediapy on Anaconda?

thank you very much!

Cool, I will try this out tonight.  Nevermind, mediapipe is too complicated to get working in python on the jetson nano.

You're amazing my man!

Dear friend, as allways amazing. Now a days I'm working around a sign languaje interpreter and I was guessing how to face it; I think this solution suits perfectly my needs!!!!!!! and again you did it for free!!!!! Now I have landmarks and tracking info I think I can compare with saved ones, create a dictionary and just translate into speech. The inverse is just about speech recognition an show appropiate presaved image or sequence.  I'm afraid this google library won't be royalty free for use, even in non commercial apps, is it? I think something like a sign languaje interpreter should be in every government administration, office, transport and commerce for free, but unfortunatelly Administrations don't seem to be interested on it.  So, thanks a lot, see you on next video and best regards.

Could you detect gesture reconition using mediapipe?

Murtaza you are awesome! Do you have any udemy course ?

Yes, soon

@murtazasworkshop  Great!!

Glad you like them!

@murtazasworkshop  HELP  ! .....not able to install mediapipe   ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement mediapipe ERROR: No matching distribution found for mediapipe

@theryze.  I am also using 3.7  ..... already checked.

Glad you liked it

Glad it helped

My pleasure 😊

Wtf? You got a hand fetish or something...why?

Well, The heart wants what it wants.

Coming up next ...

I agree :-) !

Thank you for your kind words. Keep Spreading the word and by you help I will be there in no time.

@murtazasworkshop  please update your github, following your video gives me error- cTime = time.time() fps = 1 / (cTime  - pTime) pTime = cTime this gives me an error saying pTime is not defined

you need to set pTime to 0 for the purpose of initialization: pTime = 0 hope this solves your error

joke of the day lol..

bro 271k is not underrated at all.

Put the camera upside down on a table, and you get a cheap leap motion controller 😂

you can do that via pip inside conda environment as anaconda doesn't have this package as of now

Welcome!

Lol

Sounds like a great project. Good Luck . Media pipe is under Apache License 2.0 license based on their GitHub. So If you follow their guidelines you should be able to use it in commercial projects as well.

@murtazasworkshop  Thanks a lot. Certainlly it would be a huge and difficult project, so it will need time.

very interesting and useful, it is also quite fast.

Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI -awesomee

gj! do more on C++

You are pro mam 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Oh my God. Amazing video!!! You're the best

Why did not you translate? I am one of your followers from Egypt
