I am from Bangladesh. I had learn a lot thing in this video.Thanks for the video,,,keep it up

I want to become what you are ❤

Hey man, how is it possible to be so proficient at so many disciplines? I want to be like you, please show me the way

What service did you use to CNC the metallic parts? Wasnt that very expensive for such a small project?

which printer/post processing did you use

you are the whole company, amazing

nice setup bro

can you sell me please

Wow, wow , wow slow down

Vamos Telecos !!! + Mecatrónica

Cannot believe the word dummy was even used, it a full scale desktop robot arm

does anyone know titles of the music used in this video?

India audience

This video is amazing and encouraging.

Inspiring!

Very cool project! Is it production ready? There is alot of work to be done in manufacturing!

All this stuff with this many interaction mode is insane. I am already building one robotic arm but am also adding this into the list for sure. This is real COOL

👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 i have no word bravo for the code 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

What applications did you use and why?

最近怀疑读的书是不是没用，内容有的OO 有的XX 直到看到机械臂下方的中文书才想到"对了曾经某人惊叹道，十年了除了简体书能有如此冲击之外，怕是寻遍书店横扫网站游历世界也能与之差身而过也未能如愿" 自己怕是要看上几百遍才能满意阿，非常感谢您的分享!!!谢谢!!!

Hello, I'm a robot competition and development team from Thailand. My 14 and 11 year old sister and I practiced and developed among ourselves within the house, learning from youtube and the Internet.   I would like to leave my channel. Thank you everyone. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcDsBRLJrudbrHjeH1bhGLw UCcDsBRLJrudbrHjeH1bhGLw

How did you create that software development map at 7:49 ?

牛B

Is YouTube not ban in China?

What is his engineering degree?

Great Work!

很好，💯

Surgery on a grape!

simply fantastic you are great!!! Congratulations. I was shocked by this project. good boy.

Bro

this guy top OG

Нормально запарился, чтобы виноградинку зашить. Трудно представить, на что он способен, чтобы решить еще более сложные задачи.

Can I know what motors used? Is it 10 motors?

What's the cost of the solution?

What kind of motors were used?

Too difficult for my talent, it’s hard to copy for me 😂

What is he using for the drawing part

ooooohhhh, coooooooool.

Bhai yr English version me bhi bana do video

Good day, may I know where you purchased the planetary gear

尼瑪

Filhal caption se kaam chelega ?  From my side yes

估计是网上最牛的机器人up主了！

😍😍😍😍😍

This is completely on another level.

一个人能干一个团队的活啊，还是业余时间做的，厉害的

Can we be friends?

Sorry for the question but how motors comunicate with the controller ?

How much time did it took to complete this?

This project is so impressive that I bowed down in front of my screen 5 times in just pure awe and admiration of the raw technical skills displayed here.

I understand nothing of what he says kkkkk(this type of laugh is Brazilian) but this man is fantastic.

very cute

This guy I a hole different unit. Somebody fund him, give him a company, kiss his feet

Shi shi sho sho sho gee gee Joo shesheshi 😅😅 But work is soo good ❤

Your a genius

神仙

Too bad the arm is dummy. If it actually worked, it could be very useful.

一个人怎么会这么多东西的。。

Wow!!!!!!

can you please post tutorial for this? please please please please please please please please

牛

hey vato muy buen video  eres un crack saludos desde mexico

Yes

Mad respect!

太棒了！小稚 Super ❤️

Pretty impressive.  Well done man!

crazy talent

Those closed loop drivers seem like they could easilly be applied to 3d printers. hmmmm...

hiii, do you have some social media??? I need to talk with you plsss

Your gonna be a rich man soon 🙌🏾

Hi, 稚晖君 Thank you for this amazing video :). the harmonic drives that you used are super expensive, over 1k and the two Oriental motor as well. i am sure you are probably too busy to reply back but in case you do. could yo plz suggest some alternatives or where to buy them cheaper. thank you again for sharing this.

This guy is insane! he mentioned everything he did like: just like that. but if you know, this should be done by a team!!! and he did it by himself!! Talented!

holy crap, nice job

I just want to know, what nema stepper did you use??

i always thought that i am above average but what i saw made believe i am truly dumb

How did you get the materials

Holy Jesus

you are a genius

In which software u did programming. I mean "IDE" also can u tell me what math did u use for it ??? To rotate all the axis

How this super genius only has 127K subscribers is mind boggling. He's the real MR BEAST!

知识太渊博了，佩服

This is madness😰...How can one person know all of this?

any chance of the PCB files in another format so i can order some?

你需要学习多少才能设计出这样的东西？

👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

how much did you spent in total on the robot?

OMG!

Awesome

The combination of black and red is perfect.

This is an amazing proyect, this man is awesome

You did pretty awesome work here, hats off! I would be very interested in further videos about the technical stuff. I would like to know at least 10% of what you know :D

Excellent work!, have you a web page of this project? I would like to know more about this. This has the potential of a first class product. Any place to purchase one of this?

Bless youtube for subtitles. Phenomenal project and execution. Cheers from germany!

THEY DID SURGERY ON A GRAPE!!!

😮😮😮

i like your projects,i would like arduino ,help me some get arduino main component please!!😔😔

Awesome 👍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

💪Heres a Genius🇨🇳 in 🔩Mechanized⚙️ and 🤖Robotic🏗 Technology📶. 🤗greetings from👍  🗽NEW YORK 🇺🇸USA

Awesome with Fusion 360!!!!!

Okay, I don't usually comment on youtube, but now I have to. This is the most advanced DIY project I've ever seen on youtube. I'm interested in FOC, AHRS,  and other robotics stuff, but the sheer amount of tech and work in this project is mind-blowing. Such project are done by TEAMS of people. If you really know all this stuff then please change the world and aim for the stars.

I hope that one day you’ll switch to English

Нихуясебе

8:18 так це математика, але математика річ абстрактна, саме електроніка і механіка матеріалізують її в реальний світ

他本科和研究生是电子科技大学，专业是微电子和集成电路，后面在华为上班

wow yes

He just started a company and released the first Robot product a few days ago.

Oh man dude you didn't just buy all those parts ....so beautiful... and speed to the build?! man I've been waiting for the build! I want to see you building it. that's what I came to see

Which software are you using to design robot model

Ooooo nooooo habla en chinoooo😑

man you are a genious! loved your video!

Очень интересно, большое спасибо!

"from scratch" Did you invent the universe?

Wow man truly amazing!

By far the best DIY mini robot arm!

本人吗？

Просто ахуеть.  This so cool man!

ошалеть

视频很喜欢黑屏 真是体验差

Bro, i love you. fuck this amount of talent

What is the name of the machine that appears in minute 6:35 heating the PCBs?

Michael reeves daddy

wow

Wow~~~! It's fantastic.

is it for sale ?

amazing.

The fit and finish of your projects are impeccable!

Software's pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeas

?????????

Okay that s an entirely new level here ... He made it like coding an inverse / forward kinematic algo like it s nothing ??? Extremely impressive skills. This guy is a REALLY fast learner. The Ai reinforcing part only would be a fantastic youtube video. I m off words.

stepper specification please?

I would love to connect with you for some business collaboration kindly let me know best way to contact you

thank you . Amazing .

Brilliant

YOUTUBE - where you at with the ai generated auto english dub? I wanna audibly absorb this man

除了说一句牛逼，不知道该说什么了。太牛逼了

Really expensive trash...

Level: Asian.

There is a lot of technology in this project. Congratulation for all your creativity and dedication. Use your hability to create a better world!

I checked your open source repository, can I ask what is the purpose of the circuit named "Dangle" please? I am trying to replicate this project so it would be great if you help me. Thank you a lot.

What printer do you use?

If any quote within this project summed it up as to why it impressed me was "To conquer new knowledge and technologies"  (mind you, he didn't say "learn").  Clearly, I was watching an accomplished Techno-Craftsman exhibiting quite the Rodeo display of his skills.  Hats off to you for sharing your journey, although I was here for the DIY for dummies... 🤔

천재네

Damn I wish I was this badass!

Amazing work.

This guy is 100x smarter than the simpleton Elon Musk.

就想知道什么时候能有购买链接

I’m not normally amazed by YouTube videos, I often go looking for builds and content and am disappointed with how basic/aimed at kids the designs are.  But, my god… this guy just kept making it cooler and cooler, when he whipped out the little touchscreen I was laughing in amazement. I hope one day I can be as talented as this dude

Something beautiful and good luck

ما شاء الله😊😊😊

this guy right here is on a whole other level

iron man

Taiwan number one

大牛！

Wow! This would be awesome in the englisch language!

can you share the arm 3d files to print ?

very well done

It not only works really well with high precision, but it also looks very elegant doing the demonstrations. And what a dedication to this project, just wow!

9:09 What is the programm that you have used?

الله علم الانسان مالم يعلم علينا ان نحمد الله على هذه النعمه

13:50 no way you pulled this meme 😂

From scratch he said. Fake but predictable.

A true mechatronics engineer he is!

You my friend are incredible. I wish I had a friend like you nearby that I could bother every day to learn 1% of what you know.

I gotta feeling this gonna be good.

I can see why doctors choose this design over Michael Reeves surgical robot.

I didnt understand a word you said, but thank God for subtitles.

fake? he won several competitions back when he was in middle school. he was famous back then already.

@timetraveller2300  yes fake. This is not a SCRATCH. Usual clickbait.

@4ngryNRD  what is a "scratch" then? define scratch? you mean he should start from an iron mine? or smelting? what are you talking about? He built this robotic arm from scratch.

@timetraveller2300  ok. if combining some factory premade spare parts together is 'from scratch' I apologize. I didn't want to hurt you. just hate clickbait.

@4ngryNRD   what factory premade spare parts? he did the design. and he custom made the arm with Aluminum alloy CNC. he did all the programming for the controllers. let's see you make one with the exact same steps? can you even replicate it? I bet you can't even do a tenth of what is shown here.  just another loser bashing others to make himself feel less anxious.

Brother, is the any way i can get your email address? You website is not working.

太神奇了:yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis:

Good work man , i want to contact you, how i can contact you?

I would totally buy this! What an incredible DIY project.

This is the epitome of all DIY videos.... I'm getting goosebumps. 666 ❤ INSPIRATIONAL.... 🥵🥵

Incredible - Cheers

Seriously impressive!

😅😅没有这样的脑子也就算了，连这样的手我也没有。人和人差别好大！

Это нереально круто!

青春版啥时候呀😂

cool

That is so amazing! How much time did that take?!?

Para comunicarme

Chino buenas tardes

very impressive please English please

Это просто офигенно! Ты молодец, желаю успехов в этом нелёгком, но интересном деле! Так держать бро!

Nice

技术类的李子柒。not bad.

有在售吗？

Amazing Awesome

if i wanted to build this but didnt know chinese, how should i go about this

Might anyone know the name of the first song?

Great work, as an EE engineer and part time mechatronic, I think this takes a lot of effort to make it possible from scratch.

it is very good bro

do you think it would be possible to connect these kinds of little self made robots onto a profibus ?

U're a genius

The time and effort that went into this project is insane. The end result is so good.

Очень вдохновляющее видео. Я даже прослезился. Успехов тебе в жизни.

Calling this a "Dummy" robotic arm is insulting. This is a masterpiece! Great job!

Is no one going to talk about how he did surgery on a grape? Your work is amazing, keep it up if that's at all possible

Ur genius

Нет слов… просто ….

Your are a very talented individual

Genius tahnk you for sharing.

Donde puedo comprar o conseguir la board para el nema17?

ah ja ja ya ya ya, my title is in enyash and I speahk ah brohken da mandahrin....

Hello sir could you please resources need to bulit this kind of things?I am completely beginner.

Does anyone know if these robots are sold or if they sell the kit to assemble them?

12:14 is truly amazing

Obviously, you can turn on the subtitle feature in the bottom right corner of YouTube to translate

Нет слов.

Заебись видос, а главно всё очень понятно))

truly incredible

useless, boring=chinese.

How can a person knows all of this knowledge. wow

this guy is 🍌

Are you an evangelion fan lol? Thanatos is pretty cool.

We are not worthy!

Hi good work . need to know what progrmes use for code nd design  thank you

how affordable are these components

Incredible. Someone could build a massive company just around this guys brain

Great video. Thanks. Good luck.

大神!你真的太厲害了!

This is just unbelievable  that he knows everything

Wow! Really cool!

te la xuparia sin cargo

Очень круто 👍

This is a big INSPIRATION!!!  Adding Brain Interface Control (B.C.I) or E.E.G Tech. (Trending tech) is a cool control idea i.e. Ctrl it using ur thoughts, how cool is that? #Professor X.  Check out NextMind(an E.E.G company) on YouTube.

sooo, print("hello world"), and  then what? 🥲

Super Cool. I salute.

兔兔手耳仍然大蜘蛛！ 彭惡女！

use the arm as 6dof controller

Awesome...Most underrated channel.

This is so far advanced and beyond what most are capable of. Brilliant project and brilliant mind.

YouAreBest

WoW, I just had my mind blown. The amount of work that must have been gone into this. Thanks for sharing your creation.

whats the screen above the keyboard?

Dude, fucking amazing !!

Amazing. Can I ask what you have studied to learn everything from design and construction to software and hardware? or if you are self taught, and if so how? Again, absolutely great video and work!

hi can share your good friend's youtube channel link? sorry I cant understand mandarin.. thanks

The real IRON MAN

Man did the surgery on a grape meme himself

Говори на русском , это не так сложно

Amazing!

You are damn genius

what language is he speaking?

Maybe one day you will go into more details about mechanical connections etc

Best DIY video ever!!! What a proffesional aproach! ... what is the max weight the arm can lift? Also what size of nema motors do you use and reduction rations of the harmonic drives? This is fantastic work! The community is greatfull for making it open source

3:40  which app is this?

Impressive build. 👍  If there are maker fairs in Shanghai  you should definitely attend and show off your robot arm to inspire others.

Is this open source? Could I repeat the building process? I can't read Chinese.

Does he using any SBC as Raspberry Pi 4 or Arduino for the making?

Hi can you please tell me where you got that skinny monitor?

很酷

great work just wish i could understand his language so i would not need subtitles

Nice job. I really enjoyed watching this. I'll start this asap and build it for my workshop.

Awesome！

没想到在youtube有你的账号哈哈！

Any way you could link the steppers and gearboxes you used?

Maestro!!!!!

Let me guess the next project: DIY Dyson sphere?

i just discovered your channel but.. this is unbelieavable.

WOW, that takes some effort!

Now you just need a kit version to sell.

Complimenti stupendo progetto sei un genio con una capacita visionaria INVIDIABILE 😉 👍

救命，太牛逼了

His talented🙏,this is great work

What software do you use for the project tree?

你好：我是一名电子工程师，我知道你是怎么学会为机器人编写代码的。

他是電子科技大學畢業的，有開設這些課程

@tonywhite666  嗯，这是一个很棒的。他掌握了他所做的一切，我希望有一天能像他一样😊

What is the software used for robotic simulation?

PRO

amazing! Thank you for the video.

Hi Does anyone know the name and specs of those controller/drivers he used for the stepper motors in the video by any chance?

Very good

Нихуя не понял. Но очень интересно!

Theres a lot of very smart people doing very impressive things on youtube. But this man is the most impressive ive seen yet.

Chinese Tony Stark 👍

Great! Thanks!~~

Is there a music playlist from this video?

强到不是人，已经没有形容词能够形容你的强大了

😂😂😂😂😂 indefatigable

hi very nice. how much cost this item

Awesome!

Lovely.

Very impressive. But how i can deal with disappointment with my self after this video?

very nice

10 years Ardunio Projects Now, but Nobody build Terminator 🤨🤭🤭🤭🤭😉

Really complex .Great work.,many congratulations

Being he's Chinese I'm sure he stole most of his ideas and plans

Knowing the Chinese, this could be the first time the plans weren't stolen from America.

I just stumbled on this and the production value is great. I've wanted a miniature arm for my desk just to play around with. I suggest adding a BOM in the future. I see some people on the github have sourced out some components and perhaps a few have it working (somewhat? I have to use google translate to get an idea of what is being said).

wow

太厉害了~~！

What is meant by scratch

genius

Where are u based?!

I love this guy

好强，够我学几年了

有够屌

This project is absolutely amazing! I am trying to build something similar. If you don't mind, could you specify where I can get the exact stepper motors and reducers that you used in the video?

how long did it take you to make it from start to finish?

Brother i subscribed to your channel without understanding a single word. It would be better if you add subtitles. Great work.

产品化了吗？

HE DID SURGERY ON A GRAPE

Id love to have this guy start a YouTube page to teach us how to do what he does. Better than going to University to learn.

Dude ! there's nothing dummy about the robot 🤖 at all . That is a work of art  .

awesome!

wow, great work man, AMAZING!!!!

我擦，你还是人类吗？你是机器人的卧底吧，你把衣服掀开我看看

How did it go?

Hi bro, I want to try to build a very similar robot because I really love this one, It seems that he used some kind of NEMA 17 for the base and the smallest motors that he used were NEMA 8 if I'm not wrong

As I mentioned I want to try a similar design but I want to add a raspberry as the controller of the robot

He said it took four months to prepare and then a six-day of National Day holiday to assemble and test.

Dummy roboThicc

прикольная штука

My friend, what serial monitor did you used in monitoring every movemnt of the robotic arm!!!!!!

nI HAO!!!NI HAO MA!!!!DO YOU SPEAK ENGLISH?? maY I KNOW WHAT ARE THE SOFTWARE YOU HAVE USED IN THE DESIGN ,THE PROGRAMMS INCLUDING THAT cad TNX

wow!

又到国庆，膜拜一下，

当他拿出葡萄的时候，你可以知道，他大学时候学的是生命科学。

他居然还有时间玩游戏？

You are oceam

crazy iron man diy

科技是可以 人文还差点意思 因为底层是鸿蒙

Just, wow

👍👍👍

weird genius...  Is this really open source project?

是不是能像鋼鐵人那樣，再加入影像辨識，去與空間互動

No entendí nada pero se ve impresionante

This video is so underrated

Good project thx for sharing

非常感谢！ 很受启发

I love that second monitor under your main monitor, where do you find one?

??????

稚晖君，你好，非常崇拜你的才华。我想请教一下我们中国什么时候能做出Bostondynamic那样的机器人？

14:32  Peak Engineering.  One day, we'll be able to do all our job from the bed and the shitter.

I was thinking beginning a career over in japan, but ill be quickly outmatched  Edit: f that, competition can only make me stronger

wtf bro, you're so cool

我也想尝试做一个机械臂。 如果不是对不起，我可以得到图纸和电机信息吗？  我现在在越南制造机器零件。   请。 谢谢你。

When learning a language it is always so hard to understand when native speakers speak sooo fast. Yet, a great video.

Amazing!, great work!

Why are his yt videos titles in English but the audio is in a completely different language?

Awesome 🙂 Congratulation, You are a genius!

Can you explain in english

I like this vedio

Amazing!!!

Why this video didn't get more than a million views is beyond me. Amazing job!

I love your sci-fi style !

hdjhhcgmxdffffxfxf 🤣

You great, boy. Hello from Russia

Impressive project mate. Please, tell everyone that you have used Xmind to plot your mindmap (i.e. roadmap). Cheers!

I think we found out the truly Tony Stark

I can't believe he designed his own robotic arm so he could do surgery on a grape. XD

so much knowledge and technical skill.

主要是因為那種機器人沒有商業價值，杭州有家四足機器人做的也挺好，就上春晚表演的那一家，創始人是90後。

好像是95年的，見過幾次。

He is an engineer at Huawei. China.

@believeingood5875  theres no hope

@DavidSigbi  Why

Thanks was searching through comments for this. Peace

Woowwwww!, You crazy guy. i like to watch your channel!.

عندما قلت انك وضعت اللون الاحمر لانه مثل علم الصين ، لقد انتابني الفخر ،  للعلم اني لست صينيا حقا 😅 انت طموح اتمنى لك المزيد والمزيد من التقدم

哈哈开个玩笑，非常厉害

达芬奇机器人被你盗版了吗

Can your robotic arm play chess with you?

МОЩНО БРО

Why is the title in English?

he s friend with Rick Sanchez

hackathons be like...

Hello. Cool robot. Can you give me a diagram of the robot body?

how do i learn from you Master!

Totally impressive!  由衷佩服您 DIY做出這個複雜的項目，可惜為共產體制效命…

你的手是真的机械臂

可以代撸了

Respects.

精加工的朋友可以推荐一下吗😀

Can I get the 3D model of it in Fusion 360 ?

No importa que tan bueno seas en algo, siempre habrá un oriental, con la mitad de tu edad, que lo hará mil veces mejor que tu, EXCELENTE PROYECTO

缝葡萄那段 让我想起了某德国品牌的手术机器人

cool robot arm.  but i am suspicious this is actually done by yourself alone or you  actually have a team behind.

沒有這個體制就不會有他，你本末倒置了。

很遗憾地告诉你，中国虽然名义上是共产主义，但本质上已经是国家资本主义了，不要太执着于仇视共产主义因为它已经死了。

@lzzhu3925  喔是嗎？專政獨裁是事實，腦殘清零政策也是，已被全球唾棄仍不自知，無救…

嗨呀, 好气哦

他那个精加工的朋友在B站

Man tony stark

great job! Even I didn't understand any word:)

66666666666

太牛了

Hi, I'm a new enthuasist to this field. Can anyone tell me the name of his 3D design and circuit program please. Special Thanks !!!

I don't understand what you're saying, but what I see is enough and explains how creative you are. I wish you a dazzling future.  Go to the top

Donald Trump sanctioned Huawei in 2020. This dude: Fuck America, I'm gonna bring my talent to Huawei! (and $500k dollar salary)

Good people.  Please help me need bios from Mechanic RX510 microscope.

大神君，好。 这个项目中是否可以增加：非线性变速运动的惯性补偿，以确保精度。

sad that i dont know chinese, would be already watching all of your videos religiously

super !

Nice

非常庆幸中国有你这样的人才

Living iron man right here

真想跟你交流一下

i tried (much less successfully) to make my own robotic arm when i was in grade 11, when there werent the micro-controllers that are available now. i ended up making a pneumatic piston out of a copper pipe, and it never worked very well. its amazing to see your successful deployment and design of this machine. well done! 🙏

👍👍👏

amazing man!

This is so impressive

14:08 Excellent !

超级大脑！！

such a job done, respect dude !!

你太帅了！无比的佩服

嗨 厉害了我的君！可以请教您问题吗 谢谢

Amazing work!

你真是太強了,我真心希望你制作的KEYBOARD和所有產品可以量產或訂購.感謝你無私分享

Next video. I made a SpaceX clone rocket from scratch by my own. This guy is amazing

平时的 娱乐项目 是这个 ，  厉害。 佩服  赞

Your projects are truly amazing. You are a real life science fiction character. I really only knew people like you from fiction and it is a pleasure to know that someone like you exist.

This just blows my mind. What an amazing ft of engineering. All the best for your future projects and waiting for the videos. Thanks a lot for the subtitles.

From where you learn about the inverse kinematics. Any book?

我只会吃饭和拉屎，哇啊

這就是所謂的菁英中的菁英吧?  已經不是努力就可以達到的，需要天份+勤奮

Amazing!!! How long you do this hand?

可以加你微信嗎？

He is likely a true genius, unlike the fraud Elon Musk.

一个人，干掉一整个公司研发部门！

ur from china. nice bro

哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈大家都好奇dummy出处，求解释

How can I work with you

huawei，bad

国产达芬奇就靠你了

🔥❤‍🔥

OMG

Watch this whole 16 mins video with my mouth open wide... 😮

Охренеть! Круто!

new subscription 😎

I can imagine the time it takes to build and record the process, voice over then edit the video. pretty awesome 😎

what program did you use for 3d modeling

nerdesin

你好！不好意思这样联系你，因为看了你这个视频才有这样的想法希望你不要介意。我想找人帮我编程个简单工业级控制器！因为我是个编程小白：（ ！不知道你是否能帮我或介绍朋友给我？需要费用的话可以私聊

How long did you create this robot arm?

可惜了是个粉红

Please let's us know that how learn all tech like 3d modeling, programming, electrical. Where, how?

Please use English voice.

He is amazing, that's why China is super powerful in technology.

HUAWEI, best company

oh so much money in the bank, but not mine.  you might want to change your perspective.

华为工作   高收入  有些话还是不会说的，具体什么样，不会真实表达的。但一定不是你想的那样。

Maybe he can't...

if you want it really really bad, you'll always find a way.

@trivPZ  maybe it was to me, so I think that there is something about it... If he has learned (and he's learning all the time) electronics and robotics also he can learn english.

赞。

这种动不动黑屏的体验真是让人坚持不下去，但是仍旧坚持到看完，点赞

伟大的

你说的太对了，看着是机械 电机 软件，其实底层的核心是数学和算法。作为一个有二十多年业界经验的工科博士向你致敬！像你这样的的年轻精英是业界之幸啊！

Es sorprendente lo que puede hacer este amigo, me quede en shock. Acá solo hay videos probando sensores y hacer placas, mas no de proyectos completos como esos 🥲. Felicidades !

Didn't like the color

A tu mama por las dudas

I see a link to the Open-Source repository - i like it! Great job, comrade!

了不起

молодец. ты очень крутой чувак

wow, speechless! incredible!

Holy sh*** you made a surgeon robot at home

insane 💥💥

Your video seems very interesting, but without subtitles in Spanish, a large mass of people cannot have the knowledge you provide

后生可畏啊，后生可畏。

does someone know which programms he use?

人和神的区别

Goodjob! You got another subscriber!

Brilliant! Congratulations from the Dominican Republic

Amazing this machine did the DT，Great!

Does color matter...? after all he made a brilliant work!

Even though he had subtitles in English and Spanish, 99% of the audience could not understand just how difficult work he had done.

C++

Impressive

Thank you for sharing this great project! Can't help imagining what robotic wonders you will make more in the future!

WTF😢😢😢😢👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

SUPER

牛👍,中国的未来靠你们了!加油!希望你能為残缺人士造出世界一流的义肢

The precision of your robot is very good, I really liked your video and I saw that it uses parts from different components, this is very interesting, well I am a late student in the world of technology and I still don't know how to speak or program in English, congratulations on the beautiful project

Why write the title in english if the video itself is not in english? I don't understand a single word of what is being said since I don't speak the language. If I knew it was in a language I don't speak, I wouldn't have clicked on it

Excellent work.

Great work, thank you for sharing.

收下我的膝盖

Can you add an extruder ? or a small spindle?

大佬

WOW!

This guy rocks

this is amazing!

4 months... what a god.

Red for CHINAAAAA

Please make a video showing CNC capabilities, I am interested in also making one of these!

This man has no limitations.  He solves a problem once, and then solves it again but better, and then better still.  Engineering is all about problem solving, but he takes it a step further by not just solving the problem but by solving it every way he can until it's near perfect.  Such dedication is rare, and he deserves only the most respect for it.  Well done man, you are truly an inspiring maker!

love

Well..it has a English subtitle if you haven't noticed

我怎樣才能與您取得聯繫？   生日快樂！

漂亮，非常羡慕你的能力，希望你成为中国的马斯克，为社会发展带来中国贡献！

Thank you.

The way he’d announce and explain some incredibly mind blowing function of the robot, and then 30 seconds later be like “THERE’S MORE!” 😂🤯

真他妈烦讲机械就机械 夹带什么意识形态私货

my jaw hurts

I cant seem to find the harmonic reducers you used. Is there a part number or something I can search for so I can replicate this?

Чувак ты очень крутой, жаль что я живу в помойной дыре.

u have patreon?? u are amazing

legend omg thank u

考虑回国开公司吗？说不定可以成为中国版的 Elon Musk呢！

It’s incredible. Btw he is speaking so fast. It was so hard to follow. That’s why I changed playback speed to 0.75x and it’s perfect now

This is absolutely amazing. You are the epitome of an engineer. The quality and sheer amount of work you put in is incredible. Great job!

I find it funny you say the software is the hardest part.

Can you link to where you bought such small harmonic reducers thanks

Nice project

I need to know the name of the classical music that sounds at the first minutes

👍✌️🤩. awesome man. just incredible. in usa you could sell it like couple thousand us dollars, maybe more. it is awesome robot arm. with some software, and can use real joystick, for controling it, lie option.

What is Daynamic Response?

After = Workshop  !🙏

嗨呀好气啊

气死了，别人在华为任职😃😃

你他妈的这不是在夹带私货？耗材

好气好气呀🤣🤣🤣

In his previous video, this is his own design.

Truly amazing effort,, and your Chinese is excellent!

i want to being like you,  i love robotic bro :')

Are you mechatronics engineer?

I came looking for copper and found gold

Very impressive video!! It is a shame that the whole github repo is in Chinese - I would love to read that.

You have english channel ?  I want follow you

Synchronizing the motor tones really gives you yet another insight into quality of thought this guy has.

真的很厉害！

I can't understand a word of what you say but thank god for the subtitles!!! that makes me subscribe!!

really impressive. excellent project. this young man deserves all the support so that he continues to elaborate his interesting developments 💯💯💯

This is Awesome Ironman!

Hello! Excuse me, Do you have a simpler robot? or where can i start for to maje a robot like that?  because i know how to program and electronics but not at that lavel, thanks for your help!

How much does it cost for all the parts?

太厉害了，完整的做一整套机器人，而且真的是自己写里面的算法。有点像ros出现之前机器人专业博士生所有需要学的所有事情了。

is so sad that your fusion - step files cant be imported to blender ;( dare/beging you to make an OBJ/STL version . BUt is amazing, im trying to do one like yours

那么，请问哪里能买到呢？

我才晓得你在油管上也有账号

You can not compete with chinese .Hence proved.

Incredible project man! Congrats!

好厉害，但是视频中间怎么有这么多的黑屏过度，时间还很长

wtf

Naon nutup bahasa Indonesia..?

這些side project完成度很高也很厲害，讓人期待你們的AI產品

Reallly Impressed....What a great project...Hats off to you Man......Love you...

Absolutely insane, great job!!!!!  Could you sell it, would it be affordable? Please consider making walking machines for disabled people!

Sorri for my english i can say I can't weld because of my pulse.

有用到其他版权的画面就剪掉了，所以黑屏，你去哔哩哔哩看就不是黑屏

I wish this video, would be in English. It's an awesome robot, I just loved the design and finishing!!

Daaaaamn this is really impressive

hello iron man

This is another episode of: "Came for inspiration, left with depression"

Finally, some competition! 😊

Amazing What is the language he is speaking?

膜拜大佬

How do you learn all this?

the world need a translated version of the repo !

好帅啊~真不错~支持~加油！！！

где взять детали корпуса ? можно у вас купить ?

A great inspirational video for a robotics enthusiast like myself. I wonder if you can provide the roadmap file as well as the program you used to make it. I really am interested in the way you make such detailed plan. Thank you very much for the video!

Hi, could you please tell me which is the program that you used to construct the diagrams?

all you stuff looks so beautiful. I needed to stop the video to have a closer look at that gorgeous pcb!

I do not understand what you say (even with cc on) but you are one genius I have watched your videos couple of times and be amazed every time I watch. Thanks for sharing.

Wow

最高です

Hello. Is there any function example that can be done with LabVIEW? If there is a purchase link, please.

Very nice project, Can i ask you a  question,  What software did you use for programming? I am a person with no knowledge. So if I want to learn robot programming, what knowledge do I need to learn? Can you guide me with the knowledge I need to learn? Please ♥ Thank you so much

He is from Huawei China. He speaks Chinese.

ZhiHuiJun's project  used Stm32F4 and Esp32 be main Control board . If you are wanting to learn robot programing you can start with Arduino series Control board , It's fun and very simple .

@iik9957   thanks you so so much sir ♥

Ingenius !

This is goddamn amazing

东方的步进谐波电机真小巧🤣

I’m struggling to understand how you know so much. There are companies with hundreds of people doing the same thing you’re doing on your own.

in some sense, I think you are a wonderful combination of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk.

Great work in such a young age.. hope to be like you one day

DIY surgery on a grape

Very awesome videos! I would buy a course from you on how to build your projects from scratch.

ty kurwa dawno chyba nalotu nei mieałeś

I'm just going through all of your videos. You have done so much! Steady work accomplishes so much more than trying to do more, keep it up!

Man, how long did it take for you to be so knowledgeable in so many aspects of robotics? Super cool stuff bro

God bless you man!..I'm honestly impressed!

Broooo this is soo impressive. As a German guy who works as a "engineer" (and yes.. From now on I am gonna put it always in quotes)... I have to question myself if I realy deserve this title. I am so impressed... Wow!!!!! Great work 👏  Question.... Where do you got this small monitor from? Like the one you use underneath your main Monitor. I am searching for decades.  A name or brand would help me a lot  Greetings from Germany 🇩🇪

Awesome. Also what is that monitor above your keyboard?

Great work bro Love from India

Thanks for sharing the idea, you are a smart and talented guy

Can you make some videos on Lite OS kernel for embedded projects?

Tony?

Thanks :D , I bought the screen from Taobao(like China eBay)，https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=631872211588

https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=631872211588

Iw seen so many "i built a robot" videos, where their robots are totally useless. You actually made it do something, and designed ways to use it.

:)

真的太強大了 一人團隊可以做到這種地步.... 希望有一天也能像你一樣. Very impressive, considered this was done by one person, hopefully I could be like you one day. (Basically a full-stack roboticist)

Good job bro but I wish if you speak English 😁

你真的信是一个人搞完的吗？！

@RobinHappyLife 确实是一个人，只不过不是一次搞定，他在大学就一直在参加各种机器人设计大赛拿一等奖了，只不过每次在自己熟悉的领域突破一小步积累而来

Most likely solidworks.

Building the robot arm was the simplest part of this project

Great work ! how much max weight your arm can uplift? what is the max dimension your arm extend to?

Would you ever consider selling kits for this or putting together a shell kit

wow, Iove a lot, Zhihui, real wonderful product, so inspired us who is teenages. The Great China, Greater Genius!

Can someone plz tell me which Stepper motors are being used and what are the gear ratios ? I couldn’t find these details in Github. Thank you in advance.

Brutal!!!

And you still think, that you can impress the HR with your Arduino LED blink script, dear Commentators?

I want this one :)

up主 可以出一个视频分享一下你是怎么学习的吗 实在佩服

张着嘴看完的

能推荐一些基础的学习资料吗？

Wow!  Not to take away from the robot, but WHAT is that little device introduced at 10:34 ?!?!  That could be so amazingly useful for so many things!

this guys i the Ironman of China

Эм...а у меня ардуинка сказала Hello world!...

i like the idea u got from shit in the toilet and make breakfast at the same time tht wht i called multitasking

isn't YouTube banned in P.R.China? Anyway you are awesome!!!

Well done. I created a very basic 6DOF arm a few years ago using very cheap metal gear RC servos, the problem with those is no feedback, and the shoulder torque is a bit low for good movement. I was able to connect it to ROS and control it using ROSControl joint messages. The arm was controlled by an arduino and a 16-channel servo I2C board. I have a video on vimeo somewhere of it performing some tests.

Very much informative video  Thank you for making  I want to make one robo arm for my personal projects

无线示教器 PEAK 这个模块的功能是什么呢？

Very cool, thanks for sharing, I’ll be making this for my next project

After looking at his other projects, I'm 100% sure he make it himself.  And I'm 1000% sure I would buy it he sold them.

banned but not banned totally, from high school time many classmates knows how to use Twitter Youtube and Ins

You are The Coolest Guy.  Thank you for sharing.

Looking forward to the dummy youth version!! I will be making it as soon as you release it, this is so awesome!

太牛逼了。就这个项目拿个几千万投资不成问题吧？说不定是独角兽企业呢~~

how can you make it by yourself? Only one man??? cool actions

Thankyou i was searching for this only 🙏

Big kudos.  So much work went into this

Your jinan

Hello

Hello. I want to make a 3DOF (or 6DOF if possible) robotic arm that can hold 100kg at the end.  In addition, it should occupy no more than 50x50x50cm.  Do you see it feasible? Would you like to collaborate with me?  Thank you very much.

When will you make a rocket to go to the moon ?

真牛👍 我看到了 未来

Xie...xie...🧐

你太牛了！

"One man show", very good.

Amazing!  Building a robot has so many aspects..   math (backemf/bldc), analog (front-end conditioning/sensors), digital, mechanical, software , control-systems (PID).     Other than peng-zhihui, any other recommended hacker/makers in the robot-space to watch out for?  James Bruton  , Jeremy Fielding , Steven Dufresne?

what is your little screen plz ? Otherwise, great video !

I thought my playback speed was set at 1.5

Wow, you are an Iron Man! Huge thanks for so detailed information about the project and making it open source! We just featured your work in the latest issue of our newsletter: https://www.weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-184

Freakin amazing!!! You are a genius and talented. Keep up tue good work

牛逼！！！！！！！！！！！！

You mean Peak right? I open-sourced it, checkout https://github.com/peng-zhihui/Peak

I freacking love you sir! Thanks for this!!

ting bu dong

i'm pretty sure dude's a robot himself .i'll follow you just to know when you admit it .BTW i'm scared of you .in a good way

I was very impressed! this is a huge and high-quality work! It's a pity I didn't understand a word, I'm from Russia. Good luck with your projects, I watch this video in the same breath

Very nice.

Holy shit how long did this take?!?

Great explanation of a wonderful project. Well done.

Really good , man... i'm so impressed... Now, time to build a fly-car with micro-tubine, thinks you could do this ? Let's try ... ^^ Cu

Very Smart young engineer.

妈的太强了大哥，可以报名参加你的教学吗？

Amazing work

very nice , however , this is beyond most of us , the 3 small stepper motors on the top are actually a very high performance NEMA8 stepper with harmonic drive reducer, almost 900USD each!! adding the 2 lower nema11 harmonic reducers , you are looking at maybe 4000USD   , with that price there a lot of other alternatives that can be used .

Hiii. I need this project please 🙏

Как же это круто!

Great work!! I envey your skills. Keep up this great work.

Superb

實力過硬

😎😎😎👍

牛逼！牛逼！

bilibili过来支持你！

You can turn on the CC subtitles, best wishes :D

Around 4 months I guess :D

nope,  the total cost of this project is only ¥10,000, which is around 2000USD, since I used second-hand reducers. BTW,  I'm planning to release a low-cost version of Dummy which will mostly use 3d-printing to make the parts，while still remain the most function of my original one（including softwares）, costs less than 500USD, and the solution of reducer will be this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNykgvuQi_s

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  that's great.  I really love your work  yes. I sow your nano reducer and waiting to see how it will perform but what ratio is it?

@maxs1646  10:1 for this version

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  hey i love your video you are amazing ! ! ,  could you please tell me what is the Holding Torque of each steper motor you used and what type they are please ??

👍🔥🔥🔥

Cool man!!!!

WOW. Very impressive build!

此时此刻唯有一句话表达我心中所想：我们中华民族实现伟大复兴指日可待！！！

阿凡达被你实现了👍

god mode, baby! awesome! can't wait for the next one! SHIIEeeeT!!!

I'm blown away, this is one of the most impressive projects I've ever seen. You're an exceptionally skilled engineer!

dummy thicc

Amazing

He did surgery on a grape

Just amazed & speechless, thank you so much for sharing and hope you have kit available for sale

Where did you get that super slim display above your keyboard?

Amazing what software did you use for the bot 🤖 and keep up the good work more videos please..!!👏👏

could you say wich Harmonic drives you used?

How about making a mini factory out of these robotic arms.) It's unlikely to be effective, but it would be cool.

Roses are red violets are blue no matter what you do there is always an Asian better than you.

Amazing work! Have you tried attaching a 3D printer hotend to it yet? It would be cool to see such an advanced robotic arm 3D printing something... maybe you can even 3D print in non-planar mode?

awesome

IMPRESSIVE!

can you put it in spanish? please I am very interested to know what you say

I bought it from TaoBao

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  Do you have a model name or keywords? I wasn't successful finding it using Google translator 😅

Is there a more detailed assembly instruction for absolutely beginners?

Wonderful!

this guy makes me feel super fucking lazy

what insanity did i just witness. this is incredibly impressive. i am studying mechanical engineering and have a tiny idea of what huge amount of knowledge and effort was necessary to accomplish such a project. congrats 我很佩服你的技術

You are not human, imposible ?

This is the most impressive custom built robotic arm I have ever seen in my life. I am so incredibly impressed that you built that yourself. Congratulations, and I hope that the work you do and the technology you create benefits many people. The repeated precision is the best I've seen in hundreds of videos and tutorials. This is a modern marvel! Thank you for the great video and project.

Hi, I'm very impressed about your dummy robot! Awesome project! I tried building one but struggled to buy the gearboxes. I got an offer for about ~1000$ for each piece and delivery time around 50 weeks. Do you still have a suggestion to build your great robotic arm? Thx

I think it can restore iron man

@hongyan677 但他开源啊😂

Yeah i'm planning to release a low-cost version of Dummy which will mostly use 3d-printing to make the parts，while still remain the most function of my original one（including softwares）.

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  Many thanks for your response. I will continue to follow your channel. I like the look of the anodized aluminum parts and it would be possible to produce it within manageable costs. At the moment the gear units are the bottleneck for going forward with the project and in the meantime I have to look for a solution for it :)

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  Hi Zhihui Jun, where will you announce the release info? I am pretty interested to adopt your robotic arm in coffee industry in the U.S. Please let me know. Thanks

@tianxia9687  the software is on huawei chips and harmony platform, you sure that is allowed in the US?

Hello, could you exchange contact to a project

did not understand a single word but this is incredible

Fake  11:08  Robot, how did you know the depth I wanted? Robot: Le pregunté a mis huevos y me dijeron que simón

After experiencing programming and DIY electronic for ten years by now, simply start from vbasic 6 and the last fall to native, but accidentally found my self interesting in automation which is basicly concern on acceleration. I prefer to build one just for a hoby and satisfaction rather for industries. This kind mechanism was invented operated for decade and we come to admire and build one from scratch. Bet this guy still ongoing process for neural-accelerated as per the last result 😀😀

And how did this video manage to break through the great Chinese firewall?

please tell me the model name of the small widescreen on your desk

you can probably put this on a body on another robot that can walk and navigate itself around .

what software are you using for the designing the workflow? @ 7:50 it seems pretty neat.

best... can I get a detailed connection diagram and 3d print models?

whoa

迄今为止看到过最牛逼的科技自媒体，我也是电子系的研究生，也要用ai算法，和你相比我应该是幼儿园水平，太打击人了

hi your not using solid works for projects like that would you tell us witch ligiciell you are using thank you .

果然年薪200万是有道理的！

@稚晖君 9:51 How are you able to move the robot arm with your hand, considering that harmonic drives are unable to be backdriven?  考虑到谐波驱动无法反向驱动，您如何用手移动机器人手臂？

You have a lot of potential, great job!  你很有潜力，干得好！

I am the owner of a YouTube channel, I am a cake maker, I speak to you from Saudi Arabia, and I am very impressed with what you make. I have a question can you make a machine that makes cake

其实你的技术和能力真的很强。如果能有一些创造性的产品会更引人注目。

Well done my dude, this had to take many hours of hard work and dedication through many headaches! Thank you for the subtitles, I had to read fast and don't understand most of it - I'm too inexperienced -, but I still loved your video and would love to take this on as a project in the future.

Only 38.6K subscribers????

这个出售吗。太酷了

14:32 - I thought he was cleaning his ass with the robotic arm with a water nozzle lmfao. I was about to say that was a genius idea... How much did this cost to build? I'm glad that he was really focused with precision here, I have not seen any youtubers building robotic arms that actually had precision in mind. Amazing work, has an accuracy of 10 microns.

You're the man! Very good

Dude.......

Many thanks for made this project. I also really apreciated that you share the programms in which you developed the robot arm :D

hello from Egypt I really love you man I'm really inspired  a lot of love

is that possible to upgrade the setup to handle 5kg simply by higher output motor?

This is real iron man la....salute!

Plot twist: this guy's days last 48h not just 24h.

It is hard to believe all is done by a single person.

Piece of cake, I'll have three units completed by the end of the day. 😆

Great job man! Keep it up! 🔥🙏

Man, you do great things! This project is really complicated and requires so many knowledge from different spheres, I am really impressed how you do all this stuff!

This is what iq over 160 can achieve. Just mindblowing how he can master all aspects of creating this robot arm. It'd would probably take 10 years for me to do the same and he did in 6 months 💪

Great project, GJ!

这种视频都有人点倒赞？可想而知人类多么的肮脏！！

Wow that movie motivate me to subscribe your channel. Perfect engineer work !

So amazing ! Did you plan a mass prod / kickstarter ?

I find that some non-Chinese speakers asked for English subtitle, but as a Chinese speaker, I could tell that I know every single word that he said but I totally understand nothing!

This video makes me feel very small. I have a lot to learn and do, but maybe I can scale even this ziggurat? I hope so, or I am nothing.  你是巨，我很小。

Теперь я точно уверен, что первый в мире суперзлодей типа Лекса Лютора, или Отто Октавиуса появится в Китае

这就是天才吗

Maybe, it's the best proyect that i watch in youtube. Thanks for the feedback

This man is insanely brilliant

omg

THEY DID SURGERY ON A GRAPE!

How did he access YouTube from China? This doesn’t make sense.

Cánh tay robot thật đẹp và linh hoạt

I'm lucky if I can achieve this by the time I'm 80 years old

This video make me realize, why i'm stupid af

Thanks for share with us

dude, what you're doing is great. Congratulations.

Why call it a "dummy" arm ? It's clearly a working one. When I clicked I thought this would just be a mock-up.

Нереально крут.

which brand your second screen? how can i buy?

天才！

Happy Birthday Bro 🥳

Amazingly impressive! Grats on your extremely cool robotic arm and way to fit so many interesting ways of interacting into controlling the robot.

你是不是有个团队

我有找过你的团队做nfc软件錢也收了但软件没做出来

im really impressed with this project, very talented man, im already a fan of your work ,makes me feel motivated and inspired to work harder on my mechatronics degree

what is that screen above his keyboard?

😮

I get it may be a translation error, but what makes this a Dummy robot arm? its completely functional! surely its "just" a robot arm, which makes it even more impressive!

03:16 - 03:26 does anyone know what program the animation was made with?

you are unbelievable, you do great, all respects for you

What's the little display above the keyboard?

This was a great watch! Very inspirational work my man :)

you might as well start a robotics company.

Roses are red, violets are blue, the title is English, so why aren't you?

I'm over here self-learning Fusion 360, making 3D printer parts from scratch and printing in resin.  This guy is like, "pish, I did that back when I was 2". lol  This is just mind-blowing, and although it was extremely fast and hard to read fast, it was an amazing video.  Thank you for sharing!

字没打对，反串失败。还是好好读书，别幻想自己在做项目。

Thank you :D

It's a self-made 2K panel.

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  Holly shit you answered fast! Tnx ^^.  So what do you call it? What does it do? Do you have some info on it, is it open source? Looks awesome! Altho, I have no idea what's the use case lol.

Don’t know what you guys talking about

Nope, this is world🙂

No, he was doing that when he was 18. But when he was sleeping, all in his mind.

Which plugins are you using for the IDE (which I suppose is CLion)?

Está increíble hermano

Нихрена не понятно, Но очень интересно!

Which electric screwdriver do you use? And what brand and model is that display under your main display?

Bro teach me some skill.. ..👌

Please suggest resources to get training on this

Very easy-to-follow explanation even for someone who doesn’t know how to code...

Assembling and manufacturing are different.

天才型理工男

Amazing

下個項目就係整部高達出嚟

太強了吧......這就是未來嗎?我很期待

xin chào tôi là người việt nam .tôi rất tích mô hình cánh tay robot của bạn

Wow. Imagine living in a country where you can still get stuff manufactured.

Sell ?

Wow so cool¡¡¡ Congrats¡¡¡

一人之军！ One as an ARMY

Thank you for making this and an even bigger thank you for the subtitles! I’m sure that’s not a fun task but I very much appreciate it!

He is probably working on his first Iron Man suit now.

From which branch of engineering do you belong ?

I think you can order parts in most of the countries, just money & time cost varies tho.

youtube 有自带字幕功能  你可以自己设置英文字幕

@user-fg1kw1pw7q  these are not auto-translate subtitles, they’re very friendly.

@Ferraday  Exactly

dude i thought this was in english. I read the subtitles and my brain was somehow trying to make sense of the gibberish

College of god

@rakerz1417  please tell

I don't know. What the hell he Is talking about but it's a very talented guy and the robotic arm looks like a very cool toy

This is amazing truly, inspirational. I love your work

Wow, is that huawei module

the title says dummy but this is fully functional.  translation error perhaps?

Wow this is as mechatronics as it gets. This is one of the coolest, detailed videos. The immense hard work that went into this project is crazy.

nice nas! ^^

Nice! The next step should be a DaVinci's competitor

Okay going to go and sell my engineering degree now brb

that's some incredible engineering project !

人才啊

+15 social credit

Dummy, that's the name he gave the robot arm. The name should come from one science fiction or novel?

It was a product he had previously made himself. There should have been a video.

@believeingood5875  thank you

Hello Zhihui, do you have an english translation for your dummy roadmap?

Damn..

So is its purpose? Passing butter?

There are some insanely talented people in China! Over here in the US, we just have that Reeves kid and his beer-pissing robot dog.

Anyone did this project already? What's the budget for it? Thx! :)

Use these robot arms to create a robot arm assembly line!

Uh, what does the word "dummy" mean in this context? This appears to be a real, working robot arm, not a "dummy". ??

Name it Jarvis

english title = english audio

Tell me what keyboard do you have?

Amazing job! You are awesome!

I admire you!! i am very very very exited with you project i am a Mechatronic Engineering and i think that i don't know even the half that you know... GREAT! INTELLIGENT AND COOL GUY! you have a new fan and suscribe!

Amazing mate!

“震惊吧！地球人！”

A friend in need is a friend indeed - A friend with weed a CNC mill is better.

You sir are the most talented designer, programmer and person i have seen on the internet. By A LOT

His social credit is going down for educating a westerner

you definitely didn't make a "dummy" hand since a dummy wouldn't do anything, this was a real robotic arm

One world ,one dream

good job !

這就是為什麼中國人將接管世界

Смотреть было очень интересно. Очень грамотный чел.

Awesome!!

He did surgery on a grape

Wow. Incredibly thorough explanation of each part of his project. Very talented person.

why is the title of this video in english if ur not gona speak english in it...

You are Vietnamese

Now I proud to be chinese in some dumb ass country👍even tho I cant understand chinese

he did surgery on a grape

Although, i can't understand what he is  saying due to language barrier, but seriously, this person made amazing.. hats off to your efforts and dedication and thank you! so much for making it open source, mostly.

Wow you have completed by yourself, what many people dream but never achieve. Very well done! Thanks for the subtitles also. I have subscribed :)  From Australia

I am incredibly impressed, thank you for sharing your work!

Tony Stark right here.

what kind of monitor is the one under the main monitor at 08:57 ? can u tell me where i can buy it? it's awesome!

本人在读robotics研究生，本科me方向。到了研究生才发现机器人是如此好玩，但cs和ee的能力根本跟不上，有一丝迷茫，总觉得自己有想做的东西但是能力不够。我觉得今天突然看到这个视频有点感动到，更坚定了我想继续努力增强我的电路和写码能力。感谢！

GOOD JOB MAAAN! THANK YOU!

when i was 14 i made robot hand from clothes pins and junk metal without tools or anything, that was early 90's, so yeah, this is not from scratch what you did there.

You are my hero.

о,привет, носитель русского языка, ты чем нибудь занимаешься, может программист или как то связан с этим?

@cactusjack9626  Здравствуй. Нет не программист. В основном занимаюсь ремонтом ТВ. В России это востребованно. Люблю разработку собственных изобретений как и у автора данного ролика. Конечно не на столько сложного устройства. Для подобного рода мне людей очень сильно вдохновляет на дальнейшие изобретения. Еще советую посмотреть канал Cluster.

no. Chinese

你好，请问学习robotic需要具备什么课系的基础吗？本人目前做电工，想业余时间读robotic

@hongbanchoo334   对电工不太清楚。。但是目前我想往算法岗位走。。在努力学码中

不用迷茫 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RckTj0h5LnE 视频里的机械臂的出处在这里，里面有Tutorial详细解释机械臂的做法，从Arduino开始吧，少年。现在视频里用的是AR3现在有 AR4了～

Respect!!!Respect!!!

Please pick a china manufacturer to release this product. We need it. 🎉🎉🎉

Real, real cool, you are best )))

Anyone else noticed the Thanatos theme from Evangelion towards the end?

love  from China 😁 great video，i am Chinese.

cool

未來企業家！打工實在太浪費！ 出多幾個錢比你，就要你做餐死！ 前途原本是自己，想談將來，會是遙遙無期！

I think you are the epitome of the definition of hacker, awesome!

I'd never expected to see Tony Stark on YouTube

the movements of each joints are so smooth

為何要翻牆來YOUTUBE? 你不愛國了? 要不通知一下中國公安你翻牆了。

Excellent work! I just finished designing a four axis 3D printable brushless arm and I also worked through my birthday! I’m really impressed with all the detailed design work you have done and all of the extra accessories you included!

Very cool, kudos to you sir.

https://youtu.be/WQ8Xgp8ALFo 可以跟他單挑一下

cool, but can you code it to make pizza on demand?

cant you change the roadmap to english ?

from scratch? I must have missed the mining for iron ore in the video

Thanks for the subtitles, greeting from Mexico 🇲🇽

vraiment cool et très important !!!!!

我們公司的RD有你十分之一強 我們產線就不用這麼可悲了

想用啥用啥，和你蛤蟆有关系吗？youtube的母公司google是被封的还是自己撤出大陆市场关闭服务的搞搞清楚再说话

通知公安？看来你跟公安很熟，妥妥中共同路人。

顺便跟公安通报下我，谢谢您～

能说出 通知公安 两字说明脑子没少洗，公安作为警察职位中的一个，是宝洁哥还是大纪元和你说大陆人都叫警察公安的？按你逻辑我在北美生活十几年了，我打911就是在找 FBI CIA？

This guy must have one of the biggest social credit scores in China.

Wao Best DIY project

我擦..... 你这是一个人完成了一个多人综合团队的工作...天才少年 果然名不虚传....受我等膜拜一下!  晖神!

Really cool! Loved it! More please!!!!!!!!

謝謝你的視頻分享，真的佩服你，真的很厲害，有兩個小小建議，第一如果這機械小手臂各軸的外露線路可以隱藏或雖是外露，但可以有計畫的走線配置，相信您這機械手臂會更加美觀，更加完美。第二是如要提升至工業或商業領域發展，除了步進電機可能須換成絕對座標型的伺服電機系統外，建議可多增加支援工業業界相關的通訊協定，例如: EtherCAT    等  相關工業通訊協定。 祝福你。

That's not a "DUMMY" at all lol !! great job and unique !!

very futuristic work done by single person 👌

hello, what kind of stepper motor do you use?

想问一下这个是否是真的稚晖君？

Great work!   Do you happen to have a link for those harmonic drive gearboxes?

If you put english title SPEAK ENGLISH!!

Excellent work. You are god man. Where did you buy that wide screen from behind the arm? Or how can I google for it?

It's look like Chinese Government's propaganda. But I must say that: very good video

nb!

Just crazy

Ничего не понятно, но очень интересно.

JE COMPRENDS PAS TROP CE QUE TU DIS MAIS C'EST INTERESSANT!

要是能用用在我们的设备上就好了，有可能我们用不起  😂😂

哈哈 这里也可以看到你，厉害了，野生钢铁侠！！！

稚晖君视频里的键盘是什么键盘

what a genius

你很厉害！！！

这些东西很棒，但还是要注意注册版权专利！

In case people are not aware, SUBTITLES (closed captions) are available!

Very very well done. You're a brilliant developer and I hope you'll get the appreciation you deserve (both professional and private)

I have graduated on mechatronics, even though i have good perception on mechanical system design but i suck at electronics, software and control system development...  Let alone AI.  But he inspires me to try on other stuffs, now I'm fighting with ARM and firmware development as well as electronics.  I hope i can do stuff like him in future even i have very less talent.   Inspires works a lot , believe me.

中国要有超一流的公司，才能吸引超一流的人才，而超一流的人才，又会聚集超一流的人才、带领超一流的公司并孵化出更多超一流的公司，这种良性循环，以前被美国利用，现在要在中国实现！

这个控制机械臂的环境是什么软件呀

绝对令人惊叹的作品！

大開眼界!!! 👍

人與人之間的差距......how huge this distance between your IQ and mine (translation for English speaker）

@fjj9935  ok

Wooooo

лайк супер  лайк

Hi, What is that small computer underneath your main screen? It looks very interesting! I am passionate about robotic, I am building a robot arm right now. Your video is really enlightening! Thank you for sharing. ;-)

Titanium Square Red

I read somewhere that all parts for your robotic arm cost no more than 1200 USD. Is this true? If it is, I think it would be great to start robotics company and start manufacturing these robots. I'm ready to help you with simulation software (just not to waste time on developing it) and you would have a full product with no competition on the market of small industrial robotic arms.

Ничего не понял но очень интересно

I wish i can work with you .

你做到了，我从15年开始做的创业项目和你现在做的东西，想法一模一样，专门用在教学仪器中的准工业级别。全铝CNC机身，步进，磁编码器，CAN通信，谐波减速，拖动示教，身体动作随动。看到你做出来的东西很有感触。希望有机会能得到你的回复，就此交流一下。

This blew my mind. Absolutely incredible work, well done 🙌🙌

great work

Ты очень крутой!!!

自行车有了，机械臂有了，下次剑指机器狗了，波士顿动力在寒风中瑟瑟发抖！

Where did you find the screen you are using on the keyboard??????

Iron man!

厲害👍

Ты крутой! Отлично!

你收徒弟吗？

很想知道你是几岁开始学会并且精通这些技能？

想做一套自动化.求联系方式

You are crazyyy. TALENTED GUY

Yeah it's true (the main reason is that the harmonic reducer I use is second-hand, so if you replace all of them with  new ones, the total cost will be about $2,000). And thank you very much for your kindness, I definitely appreciate your work a lot, but as I mentioned in the video, my original intention of doing this project was to learn some knowledge, so in fact I wanted to develop a software by myself, and maybe we can have some technical exchanges, cheers  :D

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  It’s great to see someone who is so dedicated to robotics. Just keep it up. I would be glad to share knowledge and experiences with you. You can contact me any time through my website. Don't hesitate to email me about any details you need if you start developing simulation software for your robotic arm. I spent a lot of time on simulation software development because I wanted to have CAD tools integrated and also I programmed it from scratch in C++ and without any third party libraries or engines. If you start with some engines like Unity and without programming additional CAD tools, it can be finished in month or two (you can do it even faster I believe).

@BabaCAD  Appreciate that, have a nice day~

xiao wu  yes I know, but I am wondering where he got the panel, I am looking for something similar

And the total cost of this project is only ¥10,000, which is only around £1200. Mama, I want to go back to school and become a man like him.

Cool 😍

he is a mechatronics engineer

虽然我不太懂电学物理学，但你的视频我都看，一边看一边想着，我该怎么样才能启发刚上初一的孩子让他也喜欢上物理，成为像您这样的人呢？感谢作者给予指点！

Atleast put subtitles in English🤷‍♂️

太棒了，小伙子！！！

You are smart guy.... Save some money and chase ur dreams, don't work for someone... Regards from Serbia!

This man is a truly accomplished mechanic and technician, just imagine what he'll be capable of in a couple of decades from now.

so sad i don't understand chinese. But congrats with u,really huge work

You're chinese? I thought chinese aren't allowed to use external internet.

很棒的项目，提供一个思路， 机械臂+激光笔 搞个激光show？

I don't understand chinese but for some reason I understand this. Awesome work there. Engineering at its finest.

where did you get the aluminum pieces made?

Chinese tony stack

@Sandy-hf3ij  Tony Stark, stack is a data structure

Another Chinese copying technology

@arcabuz  The chinese are very good at Programming, Robots, etc... Almost 90% of parts ordered for hobbyist and even industrial robotics is from china.

@arcabuz  you aren't a pleasant person are you?

@timetraveller2300  I am pleasant, just not people pleaser.

@timetraveller2300  but that is what they do, copying. I work in a tech company where there are Chinese and they have zero original innovation, but they like money.

@arcabuz  oh really? what company is that? how many Chinese people have you seen?  and what did this guy copy? he built the robotic arm from scratch. What is innovation? can you define? if you mean innovation by no one else has ever done something in the history of mankind. hmm. there are many things that Chinese scientists did. did I tell you, according to Nature Index, China has the world's largest high quality science output? You are just a racist. a boring one.

​ @arcabuz  and BTW, Arcabuz, firearms were invented in China. Back then the top minds in China were attracted by the mandarin system to become government officials, a political system innovation 1500 years ago which you didn't have,  people rarely studied nature. that's one of the main reasons that China lagged behind of course then there was the Mongol and Qing stopped Han Chinese from innovating. There is nothing wrong with Mongol or Manchurian, but being rulers from a minority ethnic group, that brings negative consequences to the society. Well not anymore. Just cope harder.

@arcabuz  since your name was a kind of firearm. here is a little history lesson.

@timetraveller2300  bla bla bla

​ @arcabuz  you know you can't cope anymore. I feel sorry for you that you have to feel bad about yourself.

@timetraveller2300  your English is puzzling. What do you mean with “you can’t cope anymore”?, are you translating something directly from your native language?

@arcabuz   haha cope harder.

@timetraveller2300  I insist you’re failing at translating something directly from your native language into English

​ @arcabuz   Do you have a college degree? Have you walked into any top colleges in your country?  Or have you read any published journals? No? Try doing that you'll see a lot of Chinese names. Oh by the way, JPL was cofounded by a Chinese, Qian Xuesen. And Boeing's first aeronautical engineer was Chinese too.  And also, the chief designer of ICBM minuteman 3 was Lin Ye, a Chinese who was also the chief engineer in Boeing. Just some educational information for you.

​ @arcabuz English is just a language, if you can't understand what @timetraveller2300 wants to say, you are just a stupid that used so much copium. Everyone copies every other that how the world work. You can bash my English freely, I don't care, because I am not a native English speaker. Your language can be good but if your logic suck, you are just a failure.

That's true ,but we know to break the wall

use  VPN

好屌，達文西就這樣四個月做出來了。

太棒了 👍👍👍👍👍

厉害，佩服。你做的我都学过，我都看得懂，但我都没做过。a truly inspiring video

После этого видео мне захотелось выучить китайский) Ничего не понятно, но очень интересно!

真的太厲害了！！期待你的更多作品！！

Very cool but do an English version for the rest of planet earth that don’t s understand Chinese…. Please…

全栈玩家，

這是多麼的硬核！

我家在7楼，我下巴已经掉到楼下了

作为一个搞EE10多年的工程师，请你收下我的膝盖，太牛了!我很庆幸华为有你这样的人才

Please make this video in English

Que Pena no entiendo chino pero si los códigos....

Thanks for the video. It's amazing and awesome. Thumbs up

嘆為觀止!!

My hero

6的飞起

I wish Ive learning this when I was kid..

Wonderful Project!

You deserve so many more views than this. Perhaps think of changing the title in English dummy might come off as "non-working" or model I am sooo glad I clicked on this video!

This men is a new TONY STARK! 👍

автоматический переводчик не плохо справляется ) детали ускользают но смысл понять можно

English subtitles was ready :D

i never realized   how fast chinese is a a spoken language compared to english

How do you call this electric engineering?

Don’t try to understand it, feel it.

Use English bro, you can join the world now and forget about China.

其實程式設計; 機械構造; 有沒有和 國際版權的相同; 如果有就可能不能發布; 賣買

The BEST robot arm build ever.  As good as a commercial product with a team of 10 different engineers.

where are you from? chinese ?

LOL. Chinese on YouTube. A very strange phenomenon. Why not Youku?

God bless China!!!!

Great video. Thanks for sharing :)

please make video in english language

This is another episode of:  "Came for inspiration.......left with depression."

My lord! You should take a vacation or something. Great Video, so much detailed and fields of studies in 16mins.

please in english version also.. ur work is amazing

безумно круто!

本來希望你看評論。走得更遠。然而。有後臺替你打理。山忒。華爲都敢這個。那別的公司呢?

this is just insane. One of the best DIY projects I have seen on Youtube so far!

正刪帖。讓我試出來啦

learn chinese bro，you will catch the future

I bet you can betray your mother for money.

@iridesabyss4847  sad but this may be true 😂

I agree with you. This robotic arm has industrial-like performances and if BOM list total is under 5,000 USD, it's worth to make the project commercial. Here is the simulation of his dummy robotics arm on professional robotics simulation software with CAD integrated platform    https://youtu.be/Qyil8V_SGw0

very impressive work, respect :D

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  Thanks. I'm sure you would have a lot of good ideas for my simulation software (for example to add some AI features). Is there any chance (I know you are very busy) to test your robot using BabaCAD Robotics software? I've already imported model of dummy and simulation is working (as it can be seen on the video o my channel). There is Python API in BabaCAD, so I'm sure it's only a few lines of code needed to send joint angles from simulation output (Python array of joint angles) to your robotic arm. I'm ready to give some limited number (100) of free licenses of BabaCAD Robotics to anyone who wants to make more dummy robots,  with integrated dummy robotic arm model  (we just have to connect the simulator with dummy robot).

he is from china.

It is not your business, F**k out

@Woccupyl  Calm down Little shit. I just asked....

very true! XDXD thanks for the quote though! i can imagine myself using it very frequently in the future

Only reason I’m not sobbing is I just finished assembling my own robot arm design last night so I don’t feel envious.

no no I actually didn't have much expectations at first cause youtubers clickbait and left super inspired and in awe!

thats so fuckin true. im a senior and i dont even know how to code in arduino. sad

My depression came when I realised the ccp got to him to make his robot “China red”

Why are we the way we are?

I can relate so bad it hurts.

@akshayelangovan7764  Evolutionary trait, I guess? If a task seems too daunting, better to avoid doing it to save energy. Its a very primitive reasoning.

@primi22  Chinese people have no right to love their country? He said in the video that his birthday is China's national day.

@user-ne4vn5qr3p  I must acknowledge my ignorance towards the symbolism, as I have learnt it is also the traditional colour of the Han people, and not necessarily communist.

lol

Dude, too bad you can't like a comment more than once. Every time after watching this, that exactly how I feel.

I'm dumbfounded at my own dumbness.

In the beginning I thought "oh just another DIY project", but at the end I was like 👁️👄👁️

@primi22    well, red color is not the color of CCP, It is the color of our traditional culture. Though I dislike CCP,  it is his freedom to love CCP or not

@brucechan8617  agreed, I was wrong

​ @user-ne4vn5qr3p  1- no reasonable person have any emotions towards a country. 2- loving a dictatorship is sickening.

@GOT the Cuteness Overload  This isn't necessary just evolutionary. Most people alive today are brought up in an education system that prioritises deadlined assignments and assessments with little applicability to a student's life, it's not surprising that people growing up in such an environment would be more likely to find challenges discouraging.

@ege8240  “No one’s allowed to be patriotic” shut up, dude. I’m American and this guy can love the CCP if he wants, it’s his country. stop whining

it is so insane that it doesn't even feel DIY! XDXD kudos to this man!

Bruh.. that's not even DIY already...

Btw ，he do it after work   He work in huawei  and do this just for fun after he finished his work at huawei

Costui è un genio al livello di Leonardo da Vinci è capace geniale e mi è anche simpatico... Le mie più sentite congratulazioni per un progetto cosi completo e funzionale.😉

牛哇

класс!

@UCBAdGeil51Iw4y29Sh9Y7hA你要不必太勉强自己。我不需要一個超人證明中華民族的偉大復興。下次你能不能直播或全程記錄你的工作？我想學習的思維方式。就像很多其他油管大咖。不要用眼花繚亂的快閃使我們沮喪。讓我們覺得自己真是笨蛋。謝謝。

感覺最近更勤奮了。不過要注意節奏。三四個月高出三四個三四個月的項目是不是有點超前啊？

They did surgery on a Grape !!!

Nice work

Somebody who can translate, please help foreigner to understand

SUB'D.  ultra cool dude!

这才是真正的钢铁侠！

Man, this is breathtaking! Amazing work!

I couldn’t understand any of it, but I loved it. Especially when he did surgery on the grape lol

Arduino ？ 大概6年前就玩过了，这种只是玩具程度

you could just select subtitles from the menu, chinese and english avaiable

He made it by himself, so he has no spare time to add English subtitles. I'm sorry.

send this to skyentific for review, and many people will know about it

Amazing. I am speechless. Beauty combine with knowledge. Greetings from Poland.

Cool why are you calling it dummy ?

Amazing work I hope someone will create English subtitles for the video

bravo

Yo that display above Your keyboard. Did You make it or did You buy it? If so please give me the name/brand.

hello, does anyone know which keyboard model you use, thank you!

我想你不是野生，应该拿了不少资金资助。

Wow!

when you do it for your country to be proud of it, considering what the country wants for you and not what you want for yourself. There will always be others who have originality without thinking only about MONEY! if you will help your fellows and you will not think about MONEY then you will pass happily in life. And if not, then prepare for the worst in your life TO BE A MAN DOES NOT MEAN TO BE RICH!

Hi well dobe, pls what is the link and cost pf your motors? Can you post link from your encoder?

Well. in English this video can be more informative, as auto-translate have some limitations...  Z tego powodu nie piszę komentarzy po Polsku.

你就是科技和人机交换，最靓仔的那个，，，，，，

核事故就靠這個了，加油！

😨 i think this guy would be able to put humpty dumpty back together... with a robot 😁

please make English vids or atleast subtitles please

hate it when the title is in english and the actual video is in any other language.

I wish I understood.....  Amazing work!

想问下稚晖君，啥时候钢铁战衣安排一下？

еслиб я еще понимал что он говорит

这个完全不可能，核辐射会轻易击穿烧毁电路板。核事故目前都很难靠电子机械设备去维修，真的严重到别无选择的核事故还是得靠人去处理，毕竟人受到严重辐射的当下还能撑几小时，而且人的行动敏捷

My daughter’s dream 🤣

Awesome work I'm trying to do a similar one so what are the components you used . I don't no what this language is but if any one can comment the components that would be helpful. Thanks

WOW

Very good talented. 👏👏👏. Good luck from SKorea

amazing project, congratulatons :D

Yeah thank i myself don’t understand chinese,

I am a researcher of radiopharmaceuticals. After watching your video, I hope to repeat your work so that I can avoid a lot of unnecessary radiation during manual experiments. Maybe a long time。。。

hi, 有没有产品化。想买给儿子一起玩。

this is friggin CRAZY!

你是鬼吧= =

Nice project ! Have you check the repetabeality ?

杰出的! good job

Wow thats super impressive, and I am proud of myself when I can configure my own 3D Printer…

Super cool robot. I really wish i could understand what you are saying coz i am sure i could learn loads.

I stumbled upon your video and it is all very impressive!

Isn't you tu e banned in china i see many Chinese commenting i hope your social score don't go down

Without understanding a single chinese word i am sure this is the smartest human alive.

but why stepper motor why not bldc?

Ля ты красавчик! Просто супер!!! Такое сотворить, ну просто слов нет.

Made video in English plz most helpful

我发现你这个名字取的不错，不仅仅是你本人名字谐音，同时也是“”智慧“的谐音，与你现在做的东西也相互对应。 至于这个君字嘛，让我想起了Bilibili

I would buy him a drink for BOM list (Bill Of Materials)

又一个被洗脑的孩子，可怜

I am really interested in what you called social scores, any solid resources other than those brainwashing BBC, CNN medias? As me being Chinese all my life and have been living in Canada for over 10 years have never ever seen these mysterious social scores.

@YDFrank  dont be salty this are known facts about china

​ @xamael1989   no resources again? just like the chemical weapons in Iraq?  and known facts by who? you brainwashed puppets?  no critical thinking, no research on your own, no cross checking, believing whatever your politicians told you. How pathetic . . .

He is a talented boy from Huawei

@user-et8rm8hu7y  so he is a Huawei engineer?

@gudang0garam  yes

这位小弟太犀利了。结构电工编程都行。棒!

roses are red violets are blue the title is in english so the video should be too

江山代有才人出，中華兒女多旗幟！

这掌纹......

Hi, great great great work! I’m not sure whether this should be called a “dummy” at all, because this project is so well done. By the way , could you please allow the option to translate subtitles to English?

Did I just break into Chinese internet 😳

What software are you using for 3D modeling?

amigo chino tu trabajo es genial

wow .... incredible project ....  congrats !

Impressive!

窒息了，我不想混了engineering了。

建议下一个项目做火箭回收，又一个美国人一直做，但是没成功。https://youtu.be/KtrZYcQMMBc 希望你能像spacesX一样做出来。这样直接可以为我国航天事业做贡献啦

看別人的影片：感覺這個也能做出來，試著做點小東西吧 看稚晖君：人生的意義是什麽

This is insanely cool!!!

Very impressive! You did a great job with this robot arm! Thank you for sharing all the details of your learning journey!

自豪的中國人~未來一定更精彩

天哪，现实生活中的钢铁侠

是否能夠製作出3D列印機跟機械手臂的結合體? 稚暉君太厲害了~

Нихрена не понятно, но очень интересно.

这个量产会有很多发烧友买来玩

It's Autodesk's Fusion 360 (he wrote it already :) )

its my ringtone at 14:00 haha loved the concept

Парень ты крут!!!  мощный мозг !!

Hey bro, please put english subtitles, I don't understand!!!  >:(

蜘蛛滾

Awesome work!!!!

Great proyect! Just curious about your secondary display below your main display, what's that? haha

englisz kurwa!

期待中國機械狼狗

👍

太厉害了。

すごい以外の言葉が出ない、すごい！

太棒了！！！我需要这样的帮助，可以跟你学吗？

Hello ! Very cool video ! The result is so professional ! Can you tell me what is the model of the small screen under your computer screen ? Thank you !

学习能力太强了，你是怎么学习的？我很好奇

omg. teach me everything senpai.

I dont understand anything but impressive skills

能當你的學生 應該很幸福.

can we have english subs

12:20 nice work

3:21 never i liked this steper motors. too much friction

Came here with the same question 🙋‍♂️

都开源的，自己学就行。 什么，你说你自己学不会，那有什么好说的呢，我也学不会。

He DIY the small screen, actually, it is computer.

@zhoma982  Thank you for the answer !

How much to buy this as a kit? I'd like to play around with something like this

OMG 😲HARDCORE NICE! NICE JOB, NICE WORK, NICE RESULTS, NICE anything :-) TOP!!!!

It not only works really well with high precision, but it also looks very elegant doing the demonstrations. And what a dedication to this project, just wow!

虽然都是计算机行业从业者，但这项目里的任何一个模块单独拿出来，都够我们这些人喝一壶的。

校友好，哈哈哈

waw nice. u got 1 subs.

Hey man, you are a rockstar! Amazing work! Congratulations!

🤯 UNREAL 🤯

Please add english sub titles

와 미친사람이 있네 중국 무섭네 역시 사람의 힘이 제일 강한건가

害我也想弄一台二手FANUC 機械臂來玩看看

🤩💯👍🏻 complimenti davvero bellissimo

I don’t know what you’re saying but I like it

I am looing forward to the English Subtitle, can't wait to share it to my co-workers who can not speak Mandarin.

up主时刻提醒我是个废物

一個人可以做到這個成果跟深度，真心佩服! 讚嘆!

加油，的确非常棒！ 佩服小兄弟！

this guy is awesome

機械臂同步的最大問題就是延時 ,要是能做到零延時就100%完美 !

are hardware part 3d printed  ?(next statement is google translated) ハードウェア部品は3Dプリントされています

then u have it now!

他在华为工作啊，华为最强的就是通讯。所以迟早实现无限接近0延迟。

@skcray9237   希望, 因為到目前為止全世界都沒人能解決這問題

装饰部分是3D打印，主体是铝金属CNC加工

he's not japanese...useless translation😂

超優秀的！

Un buen trabajó, me gustó el robot arm

下一個該不會是功能完整的義肢

这样的一个DIY项目只有在中国，甚至深圳这个地方才能成为现实。因为硬件的打印，模具，电路板，测试和加工工件都需要一个制造业大国来支撑。否则再天才的设计，靠锤子铁皮敲出来绝对达不到这样的工艺水平和精度。智慧君生在了一个对的时代更生在了一个对的国度。中国为他的天才铺设了一切的可能。

看过之后真的感觉自己真的是什么都不会。我几乎是跪着看的。

Magnifique !

4个月我连Python基本的操作都没有学会😂

what's the brand of that small wide monitor you've got under your main monitor? If it's a diy can you tell me what's the panel? I need something like that

妈的，这是巨佬了属于是

fcking china and coronavirus

再這樣下去，下集不就造鋼鐵人了？

Great. The hope of human being

你就是最靓的仔

太强了，献上我的膝盖，膜拜大神

wow

dude this project is on another level

好厉害

各位知道他用的是哪款设计软件？就画图那个软件

别舔了，都有开源的机械臂

标题最好加个from sketch，不然显示不了这视频的牛逼程度，不知道的还以为拼儿童玩具

自我意淫。

@harmonyflexmanz9456  是不是很酸，忍着。

@user-on5br5li7d 你屁都不懂。这个youtuber我也非常欣赏，这里讲的是这个傻逼评论。你如果做机械臂就知道，这位志辉君动手能力强，经验丰富，知识广博，非常值得学习他的精神和方法，但是不是说他做的东西别人很难实现。几年前国内实现这些功能的大小公司和车库工程师很多。哪里啊像这个白痴说的只有深圳才能做？井底之蛙的发言罢了。

这货才是傻逼。大概是井里爬上来的。没听说过大陆的CNC加工成本，更对华强北的芯片电机的配套能力更是没有概念。连乔布斯在iPhone手机的研发和量产都定位在深圳，你个井蛙还以为中国能，我那洞里也能，看看乔布斯那死鬼用眼角夹你？就等那几个弯厂当供应链配件商算顶天了。  一个多层板custom production，弯弯能出多少的价钱？多久交付？？ @harmonyflexmanz9456

@MrLiaojerry  这里讨论的又不是量产，cnc加工中心全世界多的是，一定要比最先进的设备也是在德国，而且这个机械臂也用不到那么高的加工精度。 一定要讲的话iPhone的生产线也只有一部分组装是在中国，菲律宾越南台湾都有一部分生产线。而且这跟主题无关。这个机械手臂根本不存在哪一个国家能做哪一个国家做不了的问题，至少工程机阶段是不存在的。 多层板你如果说的是pcb板的话也是全球大量的代工厂可以做，深圳确实有很多这种厂商，但是这种难度也不大，北美欧洲订货都很容易。 华强北都被你搬出来了，华强北只是个机械电子零部件的集散中心而已。

@MrLiaojerry  台湾的产业链确实不如大陆齐全，但是像这种半精加工和多层pcb板完全是可以做出来的。否则大部分机械零配件坏了都要从岛外运过来，这是不可能的。 我们一般讨论产业链指的都是量产才存在成本优势的比较。你还是学习一下怎么制作一个四连杆机构再来说这样的蠢话吧。

@harmonyflexmanz9456  我问你多层板的custom加工价格，你没有回答我。华强北，义乌市场就是靠种类，品种和价格来实现碾压的。蠢话来蠢话去，你对加工业就没点概念，还是回你的井底去蹲好了，反正天就簸箕那么点大。

说对了关键，国内已经到了人人都可以diy的时代，电路 建模，只要你能设计，就能低价造出来样品

What's the point of publishing the title in English. 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♂️

達文西手術系統！？

我好奇地問你有什麼鍵盤！ ：） 偉大的。 被電腦抓到

You need to put it on Kickstarter!

中國不利品牌發展。好東西好人才都被外國貼牌再高價出售給自己中國人。可惜。

罗永浩 说过一句话，人类最不公平的就是 天生智商就不一样。    有道理啊  哎 我躺下了。

fucking amazing!!! One man army!!!!

这个精度以后直接可以用到医疗手术刀了👍👍

太帥了

那么问题来了，哪里可以买到呢

牛人的朋友也都是牛人

不把我们侃晕   誓不罢休

請問有販賣嗎

借分享

太利害了，整合靭體，軟體，電子，電機，機械。一人即軍隊

yo really cool project, wish there is english subtitle

Where can i find the architecture design diagram? Amazing work!

牛人呀

Subtitle please!

Should add english subtitle

是呀，DJI也是国外贴牌，ONE PLUS，小米，OPPO，HUAWEI，开在英国欧洲各国街上的比亚迪电动公交，开在芝加哥，南美多国的中车地铁都是贴牌。所以中国别发展人才别积累，像台湾一样买买买就行了

Respect

看到后，立刻传给十二岁的外孙。

特别爱看，可是又看不太懂，这可咋整？！

🌹🌟🌹

大佬确实牛逼.

My man, why would you put an English title on then speak Chinese? Use Chinese in the title or at least put English subs, otherwise you are wasting people's time.

嘆為觀止 真的太強又太努力了

猜想华为是不是也在发展工业机器人

可以量產了

这样的人竟然被华为招去了…

Hey, would love to follow along. Could you add english subtitles?

我一直看, 內心充滿喜悅, 对你抱有很大的期望, 我国什么时候能做出像Boston Dynamic 的机器人, 什至比它做得更好的.

这么牛逼为啥不给华为做光刻机？让老任卖这个机械臂也不错。

跪了

Greetings smart young man. Very nice project. Congratulations. 👏👏👏

这就是理工生极致的浪漫，佩服

這個人也太強了吧，現實版鋼鐵人

华为招一个人顶一个团队，太值了

全能

强人👍也许不久的将来可以炒菜做手术了！

It’s time to study Chinese now.

对啊，人家这么牛逼你为什么不叫爸爸？

Elon Mask这么牛逼为什么不做疫苗，让NASA卖新冠快筛也不错啊。

接下来是不是该搞智能语音控制交互了。。。。

又是偷国外开源项目

这是活的tony stark啊。。。。。。

这位是软硬通吃啊，厉害！！！

期待满级人类大神 未来更多的作品

B站已投币，再来支持一波

牛逼，太厉害👍

妈妈问我为什么跪着看视频

brilliant,wanna have one

噫？怎么肥四，容我戴上护膝再看一遍~

有28个点踩，估计他们觉得自己比UP主牛

哇哦，厉害了我的哥

Impressive work and dedication in hardware and software.

Wow that harmonic drives are cool!!! Where did you bought them ?

B站看过，这是二刷。

NASA很快會聯絡你,提供一紙合約🤣

雖然你所說的科技術語我一點都聽不懂，但十分喜歡愛看。少年强，中國强！希望你能為中國未來科技發展出一份力吧。加油！

He is really trying to teach my dumb ass how to do it  - =͟͟͞͞ =͟͟͞͞ ﾍ( ´Д`)ﾉ

中国钢铁侠!

硬體花點時間還能搞懂 軟體研究超過五分鐘我腦袋就當機了 真的很厲害

来了一个啥也不懂得傻逼

他代码是开源的,你能检查一下哪段是偷的?

是是是，偷了国外没有的开源项目。二逼

傻逼能闭嘴别暴露自己智力吗

NASA不如华为

@user-cg6vi5cm8u  那肯定的，先有华为后有天嘛！NASA现在都只配研究天，和华为差远了。

NASA也不等于天。

这就是华为的天才少年

Wish I could understand your language. XD

达芬奇

中国有这样的人才就有希望与未来。感谢分享！

希望你能看到，国内的话只有华为能成你大业，你真的可以领一群天才攻克半导体的某个环节，我始终相信中国只有华为公司能做到，攻克之后就是try and error。

智慧君，我跟你一样国庆生日，你真是太厉害了YYDS

yyds...

Great project and very well executed. How did you determine the robot's joint distances ? The inverse kinematics looks very good, something that can only be accoplished with accurately known sizes of all the joints

人機合一的時代看來20年內應該會出現 10年裡職業遙控司機應該會出現 坐在一個點協助多部自動公車工作 30年後應該會出現閃光高達

这不就是达芬奇吗，太强了

其实也还好,我感觉我和稚晖君的距离,也就差了2个稚晖君而已

世界终将被你改变！

滴, 打卡

200万的年薪。。。成本可不止1万

从年輕人身上看到国家的希望

这视频给我儿子留着，这就是偶像的力量

就是进来膜拜的

小伙子加油，不仅为了华为，更为了中华民族的发展因你更精彩

我什么都听不懂，然而全部看完。

This guy is a one man company, engineer/designer/coders etc. Very talented person.

除了让人感到不适的黑屏，都很好

Try auto-translate.

软件+机械+电子+仿生+美学 全能啊。希望中国机器人早日跟上发那科，Boston Dynamic。

The whole model was designed by myself（and open sourced）:D

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  IK (Inverse kinematics) that I saw on the video is calculated in RoboDK (which is expensive commercial software). I'm not sure, but maybe you made your IK calc too, which I believe was the heaviest part of coding (saying this because I developed my own robotics simulation software and IK was hard job to do). Ping me, I would like to talk about business possibilities if you are interested.

@BabaCAD  he works in Huawei, the software is likely purchased by the corporation

是的，需要更多这样的偶像，激发年轻孩子们，如果我年轻时候也有这样的偶像，那就好了

He is a Junior Genius work for Huawei

Huawei pays 3 million RMB a year to this genius young man

@tommy9118  Oh wow I didnt know that thanks

@knowknowhow   Wow I didnt know that ! thanks

@AuroraCypher  他在华为负责AI的研发工作

Вот и я думаю, пиздёжь это всё. Сидит там целая команда разработчиков (ну или фрилансеров нанимает). Ещё люди по монтажу и сценарию. А делают вид будто всё-всё один. Ага, щаз...

Huawei's genius boy-Zhihui Jun!

I don't know understand chinese😕

Totaly agree!!!

It’s called asian

​ @evgeniylyubimov     Люди очень талантливые, друг мой, как насчет того русского парня, который может сам многое построить в своей лаборатории  да, вы могли быть правы, иногда у них есть целая команда, работающая за камерой. Многие говорили, что этот парень отличный инженер, работающий на Huawei, так что я думаю, он может сделать это сам   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Me_bWKqY-g&ab_channel=ALEXLAB

​ @evgeniylyubimov  i smell some sour from you...keep it on! 👍😂

but your ID is Chinese, isn't it ?

@tanjiro3285

@tanjiro3285  The author is preparing a translated version of this video

Here is the simulation of DUMMY robotic arm in BabaCAD Robotics instead of RoboDK which he was using for simulation in this video, and license for this software is almost the price of the robot. I'm not genius, but I would be able to make such robotic arm, it just needs time and about 5,000 USD for motors and harmonic drives, everything else is cheap (electronics, cables and so on).  https://youtu.be/Qyil8V_SGw0

@BabaCAD   He is an AI engineer not mechanism or robot, Why people called him genius is account for a Huawei recruiting project named genius youth. He said he made this robot arm by self learning "Introduction to robotics mechanics and control" same time. That why people so cult him, because it definitely impossible to most people to make a  such complicated project by short self lerning

@user-borro  Every engineer (electronics, mechanics, robotics) has to be able to construct robotic arm like dummy robot, because math calculations are the only complex part in the project and engineers should have good math background. Everything else (robotic arm design process, documentation, even video tutorials of how to design robotic arm) is available on the internet. Obviously the guy put in a lot of effort and time and that should be appreciated. He is lucky to have received support from Huawei because making of robotic arm is very expensive game. If you have that the price of one servo motor with harmonic drive is no less than 1,000 USD, and robotic arm has 6 joints, that is 6,000 USD. Controller electronics, mechanics parts, software licenses are expensive too. That's why industrial robotic arms are so expensive. Small robotic arm with payload and spec like this dummy robotic arm can't be found for less than 8,000 USD (if someone tell you that he has one with lower price, check it in details).

@BabaCAD  Just saying based on your logic, every engineer can make a satellite if they have enough support, because everything is on the internet. Every engineer can build any complete electronic solution they want if they are "lucky" enough to have support and money, because again everything is on the internet. Most people see his vids are impressed by his me + ee + advanced programming ability for his age, 26 or 27 I think. If you think it's ez, do something similar or down scale it based on what you've said and explain it in your vid so we know what you said might be true.

99% of people in the hobby bro. Wake up.

@Kimchi_Studios  I didn't know that 99% of the people in the hobby of ME/EE/CS have the need of going to another engineer's video and say "this is nothing I can do it easily as well if I have the time and money". Oh wait nvm, it's not 99% of them, just a tiny minority of them which exist in any line of work I guess.

@Fldllse  I made professional CAD software and then upgrade it with robotics simulation & control features and I think every engineer could do the same. Also I made a lot of videos and tutorials (it was an easy part of my project). Persistence is the key to success in projects like this, not genius.

@BabaCAD  that's like saying every normal person in the world can be good at anything they are  interested in, as long as they are persistent. That's just not the reality. You are a good engineer, but engineers like you are prob the top 5% merely.    In reality me and you both know out of all the professional electronic engineers in the world, only a small fraction of them can do what he did in this vid on their own, in only their spare time in the span of merely 2 months.   If you want to say you can do that easily as well, sure I agree. But what you've said about how "every engineer can do this" is simply not the reality. If I consider myself a good musician for example,  I won't go to a vid of someone playing Balakirev's Islamey and say "I think every pianist can play that as long as they are persistent enough". It's tasteless.

@tommy9118  You meant Huawei pays 3 million a year for him to make those amazing stuff in YouTube?

Use auto-translate, set the language ;)

@bananabear009  No, Hua Wei has a Junior Genius plan to hire all the talented people from the world. All these people will get very good payment. All the projects on Youtube were done after work by him.

@evgeniylyubimov  Доброжелательный видит доброжелательного, мудрый видит мудрость, дерьмо видит дерьмо

@nagualabullay  а дебилы пишут херню.

With superb music taste.

He’s the asian verson of tony stark

lmao :))))

And think about the fact that China has a Billion of this kinds of people

do you understand his project really?

Totaly argee😆

There's a bit of overselling going on in this video. He showed one tech demo after another. But for a lot of these, after a short development time, it looks like it's 90% done, and then it turns out that the remaining 10% take months to perfect. You can spend so much time finessing a single algorithm until something works exactly the way you want it to. Especially very typical with VR and AR stuff.  Plus other people obviously contributed time and money to this project. He's still very talented though, but even his days are only ever going to be 24h long, and this is either a team effort, or one that takes months and still has more problems than solutions.

He also is a marketer, and videographer

He is awesome

new propaganda from communist china

He is a stack overflow engineer

@seraphine5211  yeap , he almost knows everything, that's cool, what about you?!

@user-yd6mp6vw2c  you are not Chinese??!!

@haidarkarar1469  I am Tom.

@seraphine5211  what does that mean?!

definitely a genius. i feel like a fraud now. how can i be more like him?

@haidarkarar1469  It means that I am an ordinary person.

@seraphine5211  🤣🤣 me too but I'm trying to learn programming, what about you?!

@haidarkarar1469  I'm a student trying to learn machine learning.

@seraphine5211  ooh great, that's cool, where are you from?

@haidarkarar1469  CN

@seraphine5211  wow , nice people there and smart, could we learn together!

You are amazing!!!!!

Basically an Automation Engineer.

also did the marketing job

asin... ikr 😄mehnn

@bananabear009  That's not dollars.

Very nice video ❤

@tanjiro3285  Usb youtube auto Subtitles

Use

@evgeniylyubimov  очень похоже. точнее так и есть. в одного чисто по машинному времени разработки и изготовления всего железа и софта не вывезти.

@nagualabullay  а кто видит всё?

@bananabear009  The public information is he has 2.01 mil. RMB yearly salery.

@tanjiro3285  😂

@questforenlightenment441  😂

@evgeniylyubimov  shame on you

we call him a wild Tony Stark in China

@evgeniylyubimov  你只是妒忌他的才华罢了，这只是他的一个下班后的娱乐，你越是认为这不可能完成，越是显得你很弱小

@graealex  Exactly !!

@bananabear009  Yeah man, he spends like 2/3 of his time playing games and making videos , but it's a safe bet that he make it worth 3 million in the 1/3 of the time he works.🤣

agree

@BabaCAD  if you can? why not do. Internet warrior

@seraphine5211  Me, too.

@evgeniylyubimov  他是一个个人开发者，在华为工作。你的能力如果不足就去努力，不要无端质疑别人。

@kawkchiang75  ну работает на Хуавей, что с того?! У него физически не хватило бы времени всё это сделать! Разве что целый отдел Хуавея над этой работой трудился, тогда поверю. Были в СССР такие, стахановцами звали, когда целая бригада трудилась, а выдавали за результат одного.

that sums up iron man tony stack but not tony this time, it is zhi huijun,remember the name😂

@knowknowhow  he just left Huawei for his dream recently

And video edit🥹

he is the person the companies wants!!!  also he is the person companies wants to pay a small salary and make him work triple!! hahahaah sad true fact :/  But indeed, he is awesome!

Yes man.I was speechless within the first 5 minutes of the video.

The Scene in Family Guy where God created the Asian. 😂

That is called a maker

TOP zio!!! :face-red-heart-shape:

I think he is a mechatronics engineer, they can do all of this by themselves

And that's a Mechatronics Engineer right there!

NO, He paid all his own expenses @BabaCAD

@evgeniylyubimov  Yes you got the core point, in China, there are many similar teams like his. Thus I wonder why there are so many people making such exaggerated comments below, as if shill...

我们祖国需要这个样的人才，我问下小孩怎么培养这个方面才能呢从哪里开始让他有兴趣。

中国就是因为有了你们才会大放异彩的,任何土匪都不能把中国干趴下,希望不要以后有了机会就跑去美国啊!人活到一定年龄就会明白除了钱和好的生活更重要的是为这个民族为这个国家做出了什么!

妈妈问我为什么跪着看视频

哇，我才剛在微博看到你，這邊也有阿

说了半天人家做的东西精度，负载的问题，你这个不也一样，还中国红，呵呵，没救了。

你好，有个项目不知道你有没有兴趣，如何练习到你？

I wish this was in english. Really great work brother.

急需一个能炒菜的机械臂 然后看到了这个 我已经忘了炒菜的事

哇，酷！👍

太太太太太太太太太牛了

步進電機搭配減速機構做做玩具跟專題還行 , 工業上還是要使用servo drive 同時保有速度精度及扭矩其設計也不難 , 加油 ~ 你還可以做得更好 !!

That's admirable, really great work dude. You sure have a huge lot of time to spend on you projects and hobbies.  Meanwhile I smile at my super simple miniature palletizing robot I'm actually building... 😆

老哥 华为怎么会有这么多业余时间...

世界因你更精彩，加油再出发

为你的才华点赞！😀

插一句题外话，你在知乎的发的帖子，为什么称自己为华为天才少年？感觉很怪啊。华为要求的？

b站看完再来油管支持一波

我宝宝说，太聪明了，要像学习。厉害！！！！！！

大神啊

Dummy WHAT????? THIS is insane dude!!! U even made the control boards!!!

是的，可以科普一下让更多孩子开始走这条路

这事吧，硬培养看来是不行的。大佬用四个月的下班时间，包揽了所有的活儿，这不是一般人才能搞定 的。哈哈，出这么一个人才不容易，成长的过程中有太多的诱惑与不确定了。哈哈

慕洋犬就不要出来现眼了

@cnnjfxm  这跟洋不洋的有什么关系？负载，重复精度，速度这些还分洋和中吗？他这个东西作为hobby project是蛮好的，但是和生产环境和量产要求差之千里。

@ernahubbard2062  就是就是，你也别跟他们将道理，自己做一个用到生产环境，打这些小粉红的脸，堵他们的嘴。

@chenkun945    我做的东西比这复杂多了：）

@ernahubbard2062  这就是hobby project啊，国庆花了几天时间给自己做的生日礼物而已，我在公司也不是做这个的

@user-ow7ej5ss7j 怎么几个月突然成国庆几天了呢？您说是Hobby Project，这评论里一堆堆的可是都要上天啊：）

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  14:44分处您可是自己说其中断断续续筹备了四个月，100多个版本的fusion图您几天画出来，直接加工一次对，在公司还不是做这个的，这已经不是天才可以解释了，反正我做了这些年设备没见过，看来是有葵花宝典。自己做东西玩没问题，吹一吹也没问题，毕竟花了时间精力，作为hobby project完成度也不错，但是空口白牙的自己都对不上自己说的东西就不好了。当你看见一只蟑螂的时候……

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  稚晖君别理他 外网好多神经病

@ernahubbard2062  你真厉害 就发一下平时业余时间弄出什么玩意来看一下  要不发一下你主业弄了啥 别张口就吹牛说自己做的事情比人家稚晖君复杂 你这样只会被别人笑话

@user-xv4zc8qi8g  朋友，学一下逻辑吧，入门不难的，这里不是在讨论我做的好还是他做的好，而是他自己的言辞前后不一致以及这个东西是个不错的玩具，不是什么天上有地下无的东西，你党不让你们学逻辑真是悲剧。我吹不吹牛你怎么开心怎么想就好，我提这个也是因为别人说什么要拿东西出来比才提了一嘴，仅此而已。

@ernahubbard2062  你自己好好看看视频 他言辞哪里不一致了 人家说了花4个月的业余时间做的 国庆放假肝了6天 给自己的礼物 你这杠精 好好去医院检查脑子 我猜你这种人身边没朋友

@cnnjfxm  这层主就一神经病 来秀下限的 他回复另一位网友( Liang Cha  )说他做的东西比这个复杂多了 但也没见到他发相关视频看看是不是他自己真如自己说的那么厉害 一顿夸夸其谈 的扛精 说稚晖君言辞前后矛盾 前面说4个月时间造的 后面又4天 人家稚晖君有说了花4个月的闲暇时间来做这件事 6天是国庆期间肝了6天 不是只花6天 层主这种人 就是国外那些脑子有问题的反贼

@ernahubbard2062  来来 你做的东西比这个复杂多了 你拍视频发出来看看啊 胡说八道吹牛是吧 还是你是练功的?

@ernahubbard2062  反共反上脑了

@user-xv4zc8qi8g  嗯，你吃饭花了一个小时，最后一口吃饱了，所以你这顿饭只吃了最后一小时呢。

@yiyu9479  你共把你中国人搞成天天好大喜功放卫星，上个youtube还要翻墙，一天到晚只会抄抄抄，看个玩具机器人就高潮的，然后怪指出皇帝没穿衣服的，你是不是有点本末倒置。

@user-xv4zc8qi8g  那你回内网去啊，来现代世界干啥啊？对了，翻墙犯法，包括你这个什么大神也明目张胆的犯法。

@user-xv4zc8qi8g  说出来你也不懂牛的地方在哪里，毕竟对个玩具也能高潮，真懂的人不会对一个玩具项目有什么不切实际得期待，这个就叫逻辑，所以何必呢。你组织不让学逻辑，活生生的例子太多。

@ernahubbard2062  你脑子都不太正常了 好好去医院看看脑子 我认真的 赶紧去医院检查一下智力 正不正常

@user-xv4zc8qi8g  他哪有脑子，被活摘了

@ernahubbard2062  你嘴功能太牛逼了，进化到可以放屁了。恭喜。

@user-xv4zc8qi8g  殺君馬者，道旁兒也。

看你的用詞，是台灣人？

我看见一条狗在叫诶

@ernahubbard2062  做的比这复杂多了为什么不上传点视频给大伙看看啊？：） 前面一口‘’我做的东西比这复杂多了：）‘’ 后面一口‘’不是讨论我做得比他好‘’ 哇哦 您是逻辑带师呢 之后就果不其然扯到共产党了😓 天啊 我闻到一股浓浓的酸味 然后仿佛是玻璃心破碎的声音😟 为什么这些中国人翻墙违法还这么理直气壮🤣 还没有挨铁拳！ 唉 世人皆醉 您独醒 评论区那些无论用什么语言好评的 在您眼中 一定都是没脑子的水军吧🙄 不知道逻辑带师词穷了 然后转移话题 虚空打靶是什么成分🤔 啊 您也不必回复我 您说话的语气比起做科研的 更像是家里有好几个大厂的大老板 过的一定比年薪200万的稚晖君好的多吧！😥 做大富豪就是要有一定的心理抗压能力不是么？ 反正过的都没您好！😥

sorry but please use the auto-translate

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  all great. Thanks for this

It’s time to study mandarin now

炒菜带娃辅导作业全包了好吧

把步进用到伺服的精度以及力反馈，再加上一体化嵌入式驱动器。你确定你看懂了？

@user-cg6vi5cm8u  看懂啦，這是做玩具的方式鴨 !!

這才是內行人, 其他的部分現有的資料兜一兜就能炒一盤像樣的菜

👍👍👍

Actually， he is Huawei top young engineer, his main job is AI, this project is built in after work time

你也很棒，加油💪

you're all great.

就程序部分，他说他用了“整整六天”😂

说明人家并没有用很多时间就做完了

你去搜一搜华为天才少年是什么吧……

@user-rk3nz8lb8x  然后呢？这难道还是一个职位lol

Denis Wong 是一个项目吧   华为天才少年项目

遇事不决为啥先百度呢

不先百度

@jaychen9664  百度了还是觉得很奇怪

我没有称自己是天才少年哦，看一下知乎受赞我自己的回答，我说我既不是天才也不是少年。知乎问题的描述是知乎编辑擅自添加的（可以看到问题修改记录），平台为了流量罢了

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  原来是这样，你谦虚了，你是天才😊

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  冲呀稚晖君！

他说自己不是天才是谦虚，我们大众看来他就是在华为工作的天才呀

The name of the robot arm is Dummy, shitty translation, I first thought is just a non functional arm either.

哟  创说种的天才少年吗···

我把我的solidworks卸载了，当初advance dynamics笔记都烧了，我这种垃圾不适合他们

太厲害了~

希望祖国的空间站可以使用

四個月就把軟硬體結合到這種程度，這個訂閱數不太科學，懂的人就知道這是一個人做一個團隊的事情... 這已經可以取代一間公司了... 光這項產品進行量產就能帶來可觀的利潤，看留言似乎本業已經是非常高的薪資水準，其實花點錢外包企劃腳本跟剪輯攝影，可以更專注的在做項目這件事情上面，在影片質感跟呈現方式一定是效果加倍，真的厲害真心佩服

知道任总要看，不断强调业余时间，哈哈哈哈

最重要的是 大神是中国自己院校培养的 又没有跑美国为国外金融资本服务 仅这一点就胜过一百个清华北大跑美国去的毕业生 😂

大哥， 你这辈子基本上已经告别出国旅游和出差了，华为出差多你最好推脱。只要出了国门，漂亮国随时随地把你带走，给你安排几个技术盗窃、侵权、经济犯罪的问题分分钟的事。你同事孟女士不懂技术，所以利用完就放了，你是真的挺有用啊，估计他们会把你吸干。

我感觉dummy以后会被改名叫小倩一类的

看了你的视频，我都惊掉下巴了！你有神一般的超高智慧，又把高科技和一堆我看不懂的东东西西精妙组合，给机械臂注入了灵魂! 小哥哥：你真的是科技之神👍👍👍期待你以后的创造发明💪💪💪 顺便问一下：你家人是不是都是天才？这基因无敌了！😄

一如既往的精彩，绝对大神

入选华为天才少年，年薪200万，不坐班。 估计很快就又升职加薪了

@hui94781674  我决定不止值200万。这么牛逼啊！！随便搞个小玩意，真要拿去商业化，那哪止一年200万啊！

他在Bilibili的订阅数是千万级的, youtube估计只是顺便

@odysliu9102  ？？b站粉丝数140万啊

@hui94781674 320w

华为天才少年， 不限制研究题目， 只负责给钱。

稚晖君弄的这机械臂，特别是最后的同步操作，让我想到《阿凡达》里站在机械人里同步动作去操作整个机械人，好科幻啊

@ggboom8127  这是他自已下班后，玩的小项目，完全自费，他的主业是在华为作别的研发，

youtube 限流

@odysliu9102  哪有那么多啊，他的视频是属于好看不火系列

@dangale2029  他B站粉丝数已经150万了，而且每次出视频都能推上首页和无数转发，影响力跟得上顶流何同学，这种级别的UP主，随便卖几个广告或者带货，一年收入轻轻松松超过他在华为的薪资。

这是搬运频道吧 本人应该没youtube

关键这四个月人家还要上班。。。

@yyyoik  本人，他在b站发过视频

@user-ef9uk7dm1h  真的吗 看起来一直断更 有点像别人搬来

@yyyoik  他b站也这个频率，这项目哪有那么容易做出来

他的视频被很多人搬运，我曾经就订阅了一个假的。主要他不靠这个赚钱的，经常鸽视频，这次这个就是鸽了好几个月才出的，而且之前的项目比起这个都算小项目，喜欢的人不多所以关注的人也不多。

@dangale2029  你看到的只是面上的年薪，别忘了华为可是有股票激励计划的，对于大佬级别的人物，工资只能算额外收入，股票才是主要收入。

华为百万年薪的天才少年就是不一样

@dangale2029  商业化并不是产品好就行了

华为的员工

要量产这东西还有很长的路要走

@Yarxk其实这个更有可能会集成到流水线上，而不是单独卖给消费者

剪辑对他应该毫无难度和费力吧

中文内容毕竟不是youtube的主体。

@odysliu9102  B站也只有一百多万……千万级……你太看得起民众对科技的兴趣了

@tonywhite666  人家只是业余做着玩的……他下一个项目是双足机器人……而且这本来就是工业机器人……他在视频一开始就说了机器人分工业机器人和服务机器人……

Youtube只是顺便。。。华为付他200万年薪，他根本不用想商业化这些事。不差钱

認同 太少人按👍

毕业就被华为抢走了，年薪几百万RMB

@Joker-xi3qw  稚晖君这种理工男的视频受众并没有那么多，反而是某战、某一博、某一龙、鸡你坤、等等这些垃圾大行其道，可悲啊~

薪资水平，他现在应该是200万的年薪，将来还能升职

@user-lu6lz6rc7z  ai芯片和ai软件

@yuanzhe4267  你别说4个月，给我4年全职我也做不出来！

等同于各部门都要做公众号……

因为确实是业余时间呀，我本职工作是做AI芯片和算法的，就是视频里用到的昇腾芯片 :D

@user-ow7ej5ss7j  感覺你的一天不只24小時XD

太牛批了！

还有马伟明院士，研究成果可以拿十个院士了，也是土生土长的。 还有于敏院士，天赋异禀却牺牲自己的科学生涯去搞工程。

真正的天才都是自发性的

稚晖君的父母都是优秀的厨师，优质的美食滋养了稚晖君

讀書就好

看完之后，我屮艸芔茻，跪了

五个字牛逼！收下我的膝盖！

从B站追到Youtube，稚晖君yyds

一个人竟然完成一个公司的工作。而且是业余时间.

吾辈楷模

说实话以他的实力感觉百万给少了，他的视频都是业余时间做的，但是他的作品可以大大丰富华为的品类，毕竟真的很酷

wow a lot of work! Big respect! can't wait for subtitles to enjoy it better

加油！

太強了…

足够强！希望在华为一切顺利！

感觉就差贾维斯了

稚晖君靠这个应该可以去做医疗机器人达芬奇了

Can't wait for the English subtitles to explain what the hell enters the room at 15:08 ! 😅

太厉害了了，赶紧商业化吧！颠覆性的产品！

全栈工程师

Интересное решение.  Но последовательная шина CAN слишком медленная для полноценной работы в режиме реального времени.  Процессор на ядре Cortex-m4 уже прошлый век, предпочтительней использовать ESP32-S2 (Xtensa LX7), одноядерный, на новом ядре и со встроенным USB, но можно применить и новый двухядерный ESP32-S3. Один для управления рукой, другой для внешних коммуникаций. А вообще проект отлично реализован. Молодец.

越来越佩服了，虽然刚开始的一些项目，我还觉得不值一哂。

估计年薪上亿吧。

十个up主在华为可以单独搞一个手术机器人部门啊，抢达芬奇的饭碗！中国的高端医疗设备和光刻机一样还很拉胯

黑屏好多

是的 被你这大聪明一眼看出来了

@xamxegen  我就没见过一个人能搞这么大个项目的，你相信猎鹰9号是一个人搞出来的吗，国际空间站、长征火箭会是一个人搞出来的吗？即便是天才啥都会啥都通，也没那么多时间和精力。。。。问题是他还能腾出时间做youtuber太荒谬了

@chenbill7695  把这个机械臂和空间站、火箭做对比，说明你对这个机械臂的评价非常高啊。博主是年薪200万的华为工程师，你可以对他有点信心。

@jamesonneo7483  肯定是非常高啊，和yaskawa有一拼啊，必须赞！但肯定不是博主自己做的，背后一定有个庞大的团队，博主只负责剪辑和解说。但是全程用“我”这可是抢了工程师团队的功

@chenbill7695  这哥们可是华为天才少年计划首批成员，你不相信正常，因为这玩意不是正常人能做出来的。

稚晖君大学里就做了个半成品的乒乓球机器人，也是带机械臂，了解一下他的开发历程就明白，这都是有积累的。我猜他视频结尾说的下一个项目就是乒乓球机器人 别用你的水平去度量天才

@chenbill7695  你要相信，Youtuber他根本没做。他只是发到Bilibili后顺带上传到Youtube。另外他是用他所有的休息时间做这些事。吃饭，睡觉，上班干活，下班干私活。我猜测，他没有爱情，也不需要爱情，说不定跟家人的联系也只是打个电话就完事。他的业余娱乐大概就是专研这类东西。

@zhengcao5845  天才不是无所不能，有一样技压群雄就已经是天才了。像金正恩那丫无所不能，擅骑射擅治国随便捡起一颗小石子一扔就能砸下敌人战斗机的天才，我是不信的

@chenbill7695  何不去读读他的开源代码呢？隔着阴阳怪气不如谦虚学习，不是吗？

@user-qp7ps7wv1m  那些代码可能他自己都读不懂，也不是他自己写的，他只是一个说客，埋没了一群真正默默做事的工程师团队

你没认真看，或者你翻翻他之前的视频，不是一蹴而就的，都是之前的积累，规划能力真强，很多都建立他之前做的小项目上，这次算是一个超强能力的整合，不然四个月还业余时间，如果是从零开始，时间不可能够的。

@echosama9618  只能说你没规划过这样的项目，你亲自规划一次就知道这样的项目是不可能一个人完成了，这个不多解释，行内自有明白人

@chenbill7695  他搞了多少年的技术积累你知道吗？大学一年级就开始了，正是有了这么多年的积累他才能在4个月时间一个人把这些做出来，承认自己的智商不行不丢脸！

@macklee1427  你去过中国吗？你了解中国吗？。。。。你口气像极了外交部那丫

@chenbill7695  兄嘚，你是不是回复错了?

@chenbill7695  他这个做了很久的了，四个月只是最近花的时间而已，之前可能已经花了几年了。你可以去看一下他那个无刷驱动，一年前就做了的。

@user-ve3er2vh8h  别理这种装睡的人。

@chenbill7695  你还是继续活在你自己的世界里吧

等你丫能拿到200万人民币的年薪再来说吧。人家的水平你丫想象不到。你丫甚至都不是学工科的

已举报仇恨言论，大家跟上，封了这斯的号

@user-cg6vi5cm8u  什么逻辑？用年薪衡量智慧吗？ 照这么说年贪几十个亿的习近平就是聪明绝顶，比全中国人智商加一块还还高咯？

@chenbill7695  先不说别的，请问你参与过哪些项目呢？大学里参加过什么竞赛得过什么奖呢？稚辉君大学期间就不断地参加各种竞赛例如飞卡，期间也做各种硬件和算法相关的东西，例如动量轮平衡小车，研究生阶段也是如此来进行技术的积累。还业内人士才能看懂，我就是电子信息专业的也是做硬件的，承认别人强有那么难吗？不至于这样就开始酸别人直接破防吧?或者说你是来钓鱼带节奏的，如果是我就删掉我的评论。

@chenbill7695  他的意思是你能拿到像稚辉君那样的行业高工资再说吧，不过怕是连华为天才计划的面试都进不去吧!

@chenbill7695  你的逻辑更像是一个小学生般的逻辑，抓住一个牛角尖就拼命钻，然后还自以为聪明洋洋得意。

@chenbill7695  可以给我们分享一下你做过的东西吗？如果很牛逼那你说的话才有分量，如果只是些小玩意的话，你的留言就实在是没有说服力。因为如果你自己就没有主导过一个比较大的项目，你说的话只能说明你不知道什么叫人外有人，天外有天。

@binchen8641  看看，你数学没学好吧。。。。。证明一道题是错的，难道非得会解这道题吗？

@chenbill7695  只是看不下去你转移话题，帮你做下阅读理解。看我的留言可以知道我可没那个意思，如果你工程经验丰富就算你学历和工资不高我也会信服。如果想说服我的话讲一些看似富有逻辑的漂亮话可不行，你要给我讲一下具体哪些方面哪项技术是你怀疑的，以及背后的原因是什么？

@chenbill7695   还业内人士呢，原来只是自己水平有限，你怎么不怀疑怀疑下自己，是不是自己太菜了。还有你合理怀疑当然是可以的，谁都可以提出质疑。但你这哪是怀疑好像更像是在实锤。

@binchen8641  我菜，并不意味着金正恩随便捡起一个石头就能砸下敌人的战斗机

@cnnjfxm  他不是装睡，他只是单纯傻逼。他的世界太小了。根本不知道工程是可以积累的

He already switched to use ESP32 in the latest update

聪明的毛子

Oi Sou do Brasil e como vocês aprendem isso? Sou engenheiro e não sei por onde começar.

xiao wu  你好，肖， 我叫列奥尼达 我是一名工程师，我打算每天学习更多， 我没有钱离开巴西， 但我有很大的意志力， 我相信知识是普遍的， 就像今天的中国制造东西一样，   美国在你之前什么都知道，你学会了，中国学会了，我相信巴西也能学会。 我需要的是学习。 谢谢你。

@leonidasvinicius  there are lot of learning roadmap online and you can start with some small develop kits first. Depend on which field you want to learn deep

你理解成别人是晒？为什么不能理解成是一个分享和记录呢？

@G107nationalroad  是哂不是晒。。。。

无比震撼 无比佩服

超乎想象

楼主  显示屏下面的副屏哪里买的

中國有你、有這樣一批天才。任哪個西方國家也打壓不了。因為只有人才真材實料才打壓不了。  你使用了華為鴻蒙，誰敢不用鴻蒙? 因為你開源、大家要跟著做，除了鴻蒙沒有別的選擇。這就是軟實力統治。  西方國家也是這樣搞的。把系統制度規範好後，全球只能跟著做。Google、AWS、FB、MS 每一家都這樣統治全球。  只有你這樣的天才與華為天才團隊才能帶領中國站起來。感謝你。中國加油

稚辉的视频确实精彩，就是费膝盖

最近B站你很火...

你一定重新定义了大神。   玩到这种境界，登峰造极的赶脚··················

令人惊叹的工作量，项目是否开源？

3个开发商点了diss

学以致用，很牛逼啊。老弟。

牛！

牛逼！

这个可以做工业品销售了

把全部图纸，零件给我，让我组装，我的决定是：还是花钱请人帮我做吧！

太太太厉害了。

牛逼

终于等到了

为什么都是工程师差距能这么大

你看上去很聪明，但一点也不象书呆子，很阳光很有朝气。

中国，亚洲 Ironman。什么时候创业开自己的公司？华为应该是留你不久的。哈哈。

感觉像是自制的！？

8.8寸副屏tb有卖

淘寶有，機箱副屏

是的。

华为应该让他有一半以上的时间不用上班，光是对华为鸿蒙加升腾的平台生态建立的推动作用就值年薪了👍

他就是喜欢这件事，单纯的喜欢，那就单纯的做，不要为了谁，为了中国，加入到仇恨里，开开心心搞就可以了。

制造和组装是功夫活儿，效率问题，伤脑仁儿的地方不多。算法和思路才是真正的拦路虎啊     ，  这人我早点介绍给孩子，怕他看不懂，介绍晚了也已经晚了，他是怎样炼成的啊   ，                 太...

Very good

科技改变生活

Just watched this with auto-translated subtitles. This is super impressive, seriously good work on this. I'm curious why you decided to go with the CAN bus protocol (assuming that translated properly), rather than I2C?

他又在努力试图让我们听懂了

身為機器人專業的學生，真的非常欽佩以及羨慕稚暉君的才華跟成果，能夠同時掌握ME EE CS的核心技能，並將之集成出這樣完整豐富的成果，這是我等Robotics Engineer所憧憬的目標，期許自己能成為有稚暉君一半能力的工程師。

喊了一遍又一遍的卧槽，太厉害了

还一抹中国红呀？孟晚舟现在都已经消失了，加拿大原来才是她的家，2栋豪宅，孩子也在加拿大读书，现在家也没了，还被控制起来。到美国来吧，不值得为独裁政权卖命

Goog job bro, thank you for sharing.

实时性，安全性，一般汽车电子好像都是采用CAN总线的

@user-td1vb5ki8g  I think they're both realtime capable. I was curious if he was making use of one of the P2P benefits of the CAN protocol.

CAN much stable in heavy interference envirnment. And IIC better on chip to chip in a circuit board.

@coflery  Interesting, I'm gonna give that a read, because I've been thinking about using I2C in a personal project, but CAN might work better if that's the case :) Thanks!

@Jerguu  CAN bus is way more reliable in complex EMC environments, that’s why they use CAN on cars. I2C will shit itself with motors running.

iic是应答式，而CAN可以使得总线上的所有设备都具有上报能力

CAN bus is a lot faster than I2C comms. CAN is better for inter-device comms (i.e. to allow multiple uCs/embedded-devices to talk at high speed when there is a network of them) whereas I2C/SPI are more basic comms useful when controlling things such as I2C sensors/actuators directly connected to a specific uC (i.e. your uC needs to talk to a network of sensors). CAN is very similar to a basic network protocol, but with a small enough footprint to be useful with small-memory embedded devices. CAN has protocols for packet failure handling, retry, and resends. He is using a number of interconnected uCs in this robot, making CAN the ideal choice.

@lucysluckyday   wait CAN is faster than I2C? Where did you see that

mainly because I2C is only for on board comms between chips. Whereas for inter system communication under extreme noisy conditions (EM interference generated by motor coils), CAN is perfect choice if baudrate is below 1M.

这种努力有点徒劳……

@dangale2029  不是有点，是完全徒劳

华为人才倍出啊

同感

华为天才少年——稚晖君！

@heilipower3570  他先出名华为才请的他。

What level of maths is needed to build this? Just  entry level kinematics?

@ezramantini8078  High level math (nonlinear system of equations has to be solved for inverse kinematics) is needed if you want to control 6-axis robot in world (XYZ) coordinate system. On this video he is using third party software to simulate and control the robot, but maybe he also wrote inverse kinematics code (I'm not sure, hard to catch it on the video).

he just join huawei  about 1year，before that he works for oppo

@Mai-iq1lo  煞笔反串吧…

@yifuwu3261  绝对反串 这种地方聊什么政治

B站上有位高校老师解析如何成为稚晖君，技能树是怎么点的。你可以去看看，会对专业规划很有帮助。

像你这种sb在国外还是好的，你一定会把你周围都发展成大sb的，加油

@bobofeng1852  洗脑的前提是信息封闭

再烤烤你的痣伤， 孟如果是加拿大籍为何疯叶狗不直接用其国内法保送美国呢？

@user-pi9ln7su9c  可惜你也只活在大数据的茧中

@doctorycn5148  很简单的问题，如果大家都在茧里，那就去刨根问底不断的怀疑，并且进行思想交流和信息对照,我们终究会破茧而出，但是显然，这个前提在墙内是不存在的.

@user-pi9ln7su9c  该想想到底谁在墙内

@onbonb  能别套娃了吗？  你说的确实有道理，全球200个国家活在墙内，只有中朝是活在墙外的，相对论玩的溜哦，爱因斯坦直呼内行.

@user-pi9ln7su9c  这么说吧，墙是保护大多数人的，华人在世界上舆论没有话语权，只能用壁垒保护自己。但是接受高等教育以上的大陆人基本都会翻墙，很多大学的校园网直接就可以访问外网。说到底，墙还是保护大多数普通老百姓的。如果你也是接受了高等教育的知识分子，我想这个道理你应该很容易接受。翻墙大部分通过VPN，小部分通过租服务器。这些在大陆不是很难的事情，因为政府没有完全杜绝，只是在法律上不鼓励这么做，但是只要不是出去诋毁，恨国，根本就是睁一只眼闭一只眼。

@user-pi9ln7su9c  如果还没本事取得主动权，就不应脱下盔甲让别人攻击。中国不是浑浑噩噩得过且过的国家，中国人有重振中华民族光辉的梦想。既然我通过点一个按钮1秒钟就能解决的问题，能帮助自己的长辈，子辈避免外媒无底线的抹黑挑衅，何乐而不为？

@user-pi9ln7su9c  中国人对西方的了解可比西方人对中国的了解多多了，所谓的"墙外"怎麽连“墙内"都不如？

@onbonb  怎么得出的结论？你了解的外国是观察者混球时报嚼过吐给你的那些二手新闻吗？

​ @doctorycn5148  别拿共产党那一套解释来糊弄人了，还保护大多数人，谁要你的保护？舆论难道不就是靠人头来争夺的吗？中国人受教育水平低？你去查查吧别看不起自己， 舆论舆论，争的就是“民心”而民心是具有朴素正义感的，只要能讲出道理，就会得到人民支持，这就是为什么外交部天天正义凛然的单枪匹马舌战群儒得到墙内广泛支持的原因，问题来了，我们的生力军为什么不能放出来争夺舆论高地？害怕真理的光照不透谎言的阴霾？ 你觉得所谓的西方舆论战，有这个东西吗？西方国家从来就不是穿一条裤子的，互相背叛是事情多了去了，西方大大小小媒体更是不受政府控制，完全的各自为营，哪来的舆论战斗力？ 封墙保护民众这种话收了钱说只能叫坏，自己信那就真的蠢，世界上所有的事情都是应该有对照比较才有自主选择的余地，放开限制，墙外当然可以利用舆论颠覆中国人的认知，但是中国人同样也能用舆论颠覆墙外的认知，大家互相比较，思想碰撞，才能找到更接近正确的那条路.而不是一个权利不受约束的政府，人为制造信息孤岛,然后喂投审查过的信息给大众，这样的土壤，没有未来.

@user-pi9ln7su9c  外国人了解的中国就是看轮媒吗？以西方人的脑子，恐怕还不如看大妓院

@onbonb  不好意思，中国今年至少发生过5次游行/群体事件，墙内的人知道几起？自己家里的事情，要上邻居家才能打听到，讽刺不？

@user-pi9ln7su9c  你这不是出来了吗？你又在激动什么。

@user-pi9ln7su9c  挺讽刺的，America一天都不止5次。

@user-pi9ln7su9c  那你知道美国今年发生过几次游行/群体事件吗？"墙外"的人知道几起？

@onbonb  美国是你爹吗？它游行管我屌事？

@doctorycn5148  我激动是因为我是人民，人民有义务质疑和监督政府的一切行为，只有背叛人民的人，才会扒在地上化身赵家的狗，仗着主子的威风一通乱咬，明明我们是同一个阶级，都是被统治者，是利益共同体，本来人民的力量就薄弱，难以制约统治阶层，而你们却搞错了立场，最终的下场也不过是兔死狗烹.

@user-pi9ln7su9c  你的逻辑就像我恨资本家因为我不是资本家，全世界都是统治阶级与被统治阶级，照你这逻辑，世界上没有国家是“legal”的？国家定义就是阶级统治的工具，应该学过？（难得有争论不带脏话的，观点别太偏激，可以交流交流。）

@doctorycn5148  它就一被共党活摘脑的轮子

@doctorycn5148  我确实想当资本家，想当统治者，大部分人都有这种幻想，这就是为什么要用制度约束权力和资本无限扩张的原因所在，制度比人可靠，而中国现在习近平搞个人崇拜，到处都是宣传标语，你只需要思考一个最简单的问题，你是世界上最有权力的人（肯定比美国总统大多了），军队，核武器，媒体文艺以及任何能引导思想的东西，都被你完全掌控，你这么做的目的是什么？是为了完成“伟人”的自我实现？那请问，这种集权，延续到下一届再下一届，怎么保证他一定是也“伟人”？中国针对互联网企业反垄断民意不都是支持的吗？为什么不想想，谁才是最垄断的？垄断的弊端，是靠垄断者的自我觉悟可以避免的吗？  一个猴王，之所以是猴王，除了它在抵御外族的时候最能打，还有一个原因是他对待同胞时同样最能打，这就是正常国家的人民会在与统治者的权力博弈中找到平衡，中国显然是失衡的状态.

2个字了

做这种东西，单靠努力是不够的。跟他比感觉自己是单细胞生物！

@charliechan7642  不过即使做不到天才，学好基础本领做这行的螺丝钉也一样伟大。你应该有这样的想法

B站看完 油管再看一遍，还是不会：）

我偶像

厉害

牛逼克拉斯

微博看了一遍，这里再看一遍！

:yougotthis::yougotthis::yougotthis:

有时候人与人的差距比人与猪都要大！

你是不是中国科技的天花板了？太牛逼了

大佬需要小工吗？

来了

野生钢铁侠，666

和 youtuber “stuff made here” pk 一下吧 一定精彩

厉害，学习了，感谢。发现自己一无所知。

前排来支持播放评论点阅！

天啊   全部開源我也看不懂啊  你真的太強了   還有甚麼你做不出來啊

真的是強到已經不知道是羨慕還是嫉妒了

amazing

绝对已经是最靓的仔了。

只有两个字能形容我的感受：卧槽！

等得越久，项目越大。NB

空间站是

无论是创意还是知识面能力，他俩不是一个量级。

@ligangt85  请问 你的意思是 谁的量级更高呢？我看了几期视频 感觉复杂性 在伯仲之间 稚晖君的设计感更强 创新性方面 感觉stuff made here 更强些。

@zxzqzy  老外那家伙是全方位展示， 小辉辉几乎没有展示自己各方面的能力，楼上有网友说小辉辉可以吊打一众公司，你觉得夸张吗。谁高谁低

@ligangt85  我的意思 我觉得已经表达得很明白了：伯仲之间 各有长处。PK的话 有看头。但是 你的意思我依然不明白。我的语文不好？抱歉 喜欢直白 不懂故弄玄虚。

@zxzqzy  Stuff Made Here频道的好几个项目都可以借用稚晖君的这个机械臂实现。论观（娱）赏（乐）性，前者确实高一些。论“知识储备”，或者广度，我觉得稚晖君可能略胜一筹。但是他们的专业领域可能不一样，也不太好比较吧。

@shihu5005  文无第一 武无第二😄 PK出精彩 而非胜负

歼星舰

太牛了太牛了，顶我上去，我要给机械臂做珠宝级外设

业余时间发论文 ！你是真天才

技術的廣度與深度你都包了. 期待你早日幹掉伊隆.馬斯克!!!

希望你能销售套件

感觉离钢铁侠战衣发布越来越近了。

都说男儿膝下有黄金，我是跪着看完了。。。

降维打击又来了

加油！

太强了，收下我的膝盖

生而为人，我很抱歉

b站来再看亿遍…

太強了!!!結合了機械、電機、資訊的三大工業領域技能!

已跪

Marvelous

这才是真正的。。。。全栈。。

大神!跪拜!当年本科毕业设计的机器人和这个比起来就是学前班的程度.

看完睡不着了。。。

《您》

什麼都看不懂，但覺得很勵志！

机械之美啊

哈哈 受到墙裂打击

我觉得他只要想做就能做出来

一人可以吊打一个公司，而且这样的公司还必须有一定的实力才够格！

跪着看完，太强了

不愧为华为天才少年！牛👍🏻

重复精度已经让我跪了，竟然还有给葡萄缝合手术，还是在厕所控制的，我已经在地上躺平了。

讚嘆！

再来看一遍

wtf```

真是可怕。。一个人3个月做了别人一整个公司的活，，，

太强了

incredible

虽然看不懂，不过还是坚持看完了🤣🤣🤣🤣

看个视频太伤膝盖了

真是雅致啊…大佬加油，中国加油！

天才

牛逼！

步进电机驱动器，为什么会利用FOC呢？

从B站过来再支持一下，油管人气要上去啊

哎？高一阶次元的智慧君又发视频了？

强

只能用两个字形容：卧槽！

还是业余时间干的活

他本来就是华为的AI架构师，确实牛逼。

别逗了，说出这种话都是对制造业毫无概念的……

注：业余时间！

步进也可以用FOC的，步进用FOC才能实现高速下力矩不衰减

油管上的订阅数和播放数完全不科学！

华为有你，你有华为。

大佬太强了，在B站看过了

太牛了，我也该像稚晖君学习知识，热爱创作，这一定是个美妙的过程

厉害厉害！外科手术机器人最有代表性的就是达芬奇机器人了。控制系统和算法本身就已经门槛很高了，而且对减速系统也玩得这么熟。至少自觉外科拥有了大量减速器和补偿系统的专利。佩服佩服，外科医生就需要你们给我们第三只手臂。

看了才知道世上真有天才。你是如何学习这么多的高端知识的。太强。

巨佬！

远程操作，建议改到在咖啡馆，海边或女朋友家进行。

wocao. 太牛逼了

实验室刚买个ur3e  就推荐我这个视频 我是不是该给ur3e 退了

👍👍👍

my man😁

太牛了

热乎的大神稚晖君

顶礼膜拜

太强了

太厉害了

下个月入职华为的我：太强了吧…这就是未来的同事吗？年底考核可怎么办，愁

信息密度太高了

终于知道为什么智慧是最高级的性感

作为一个ee从业者，看到了真正ee真神！

大学机械电子工程，学会了机械设计、自动化控制、以及少量的编程，研究生学习机器人控制，数学方向的专业，那么掌握这些技能是轻而易举的

那个做视界智能识别的大箱子，搬到咖啡馆不合适吧...😄

看跪了　ｎｂ

不用太过担心，你俩不是一个赛道。囧。。。

厉害厉害 哈哈哈哈

据说年薪两百万，是不是真的？

@jeffzzz7850  我没有那么多😂不过要和拿200的人一起考核业绩，愁人

你可以先去非洲

我来告诉外国人，这是条标准的凡尔赛评论，哈哈哈哈

@jeffzzz7850  一般工程師也就五六十

@jeffzzz7850  是的

@theminefantasy  他是华为天才少年计划的一员，年薪是200多万的

过了过了啊，我有不少同学曾经或现在依然在华为工作，上学的时候我就切身感受过人家对我智商上的优势，你能去华为工作再怎么着也笨不了

理工科人才脑容量最大，智商最高。你看他的头特别大。头围在57厘米以上的人高智商。

@alexoolau  我头围57，我的是装饰品。

我頭圍58，高數不及格😣😣😣😣

@alexoolau  我头围61 数学层面感觉很一般。。

然而他是某一流科技公司的人工智能的架构工程师从业者，另外他本科生物工程，自学ee，硕士cs.....不止是ee的真神

EE做不了，很多是EE和ME的综合

你们要是比头大，我就不困了

@alexoolau  哈哈哈

这层楼的头围还有上限吗？谁报一下。😂

Keyu Huang hhhhh笑死

@alexoolau  那也没见雷佳音有多聪明 顶个大脑袋 是个铁憨憨 哈哈哈

@alexoolau  我頭圍59....垃圾文科生

这个应该是电机一体化他们更擅长，虽然我也在学EE也接触了步进电机

我翻山越岭来了

我翻山越岭来点赞了

又来震惊观众

牛🐂

太强了啦

太强大了

希望能加上英文字幕，让世界看到华为有这样的人才😂

太强了！实在佩服

理工男，只能一句我艹代表我的崇拜吧…

以前看过汽车厂的机械臂，好多传感器还有一堆PLC控制，也有HMI，感觉这一套缩小版的好震撼啊，真不错，向大佬学习

真·钢铁侠

华为天才少年真不是盖的呀！

すごい！ Amazing!!!!

钢铁侠的一样

如果精度夠高，設計更精細不是可以做遠程手術？

大神 膜拜中 Orz !

全能型人才

太强了！！！！！！

你是造出自動駕駛自行車那位嗎？？贊。。。要加中英文字幕哦，到時幫你分享出去

看懂了🙄🙄

内容过干

没必要吧，自信不需要让别人知道吧

@user-ih4yh9ww2u  有必要啊，不是为了让别人知道华为有什么员工，而是为了让更多人看到这个视频啊！

@dangale2029  让他们去学中文去

@G107nationalroad  说的对，一大堆人学英文，为了学习别人。现在别人想学习我们，我们还要配合他们转换成英文？。让他们自己学中文再来看！

有英文字幕，手动选择字幕

真废物，明明有英文字幕

@jiushibushuo  真傻缺，也不看看留言时间，三周前根本没有字幕，我留言的时候也没有，属实脑瘫

这样之后被制裁的更狠 哈哈哈哈

割皮包可以

@terencechow1843  wifi用的2.4G，延时应该满足不了需求吧。

@user-oy1wm6rd4e  要是直接用光纤端对端连接呢？

@user-oy1wm6rd4e  华为领导已经问他要不要报销这个项目的费用了 加个5G分分钟 哈哈哈哈

就是他，现在就职于华为

sx呆湾人什么都要无理取闹扯大陆一番，alex这个名字这么常见 粉丝也乐于回答一些简单的问题，就成你满嘴喷的理由了。  而且我看alex发的评论也只适合该up主的吧。到处？？？sx

nörrm N  快下雨了，赶紧去找找哪里有沙包，地下室门记得打开，不然出不去。

他太忙了，只有放长假才更新项目，没时间做视频字幕的

太厉害啦！这才是真正的工程师。

厲害

yes

ni shi wo de idol.

太厉害了，从视频中我感受到了工业的美

Amazing

你怎么能这么牛逼，是不是开发大脑的某个部位

大佬牛逼

很佩服你了，希望中国有更多的您！！！

yyds

他又回来了，去特喵的膝盖，我要跪着循环播放100次

他到底不會什麼

嗯，离打造钢铁侠盔甲又近了一大步！

收下我的膝盖

华为是背后的金主？

太牛了！

震撼我妈。。哦不，震撼我全家一整年！！膜拜大神

继续观摩大佬

大佬带带偶

买两个，放背后，左右一边一个，给自己按摩肩颈，应该很舒服！

理工科人才脑容量最大，智商最高。你看他的头特别大。头围在57厘米以上的人高智商。

这样真正的工程师估计没几个

他是华为的工程师，这机械臂完全是利用业余时间完成的，相当牛。当然在当地比较容易就能找到相应的的加工厂或买到相应的零部件，比如这机械臂cnc的金属加工以及表面的氧化喷砂工艺，在珠三角下单给加工厂，可能一个星期就能拿到货，还有电子硬件，今天下单可能三天内就到货，pcb基板，最快有24小时能拿到样品的。不过说实话，一个人在这么短时间完成需要几个部门才能完成的事，是真厉害，华为工程师牛啊

@billchan7690  以前中国人在发展上浪费了不少时间，现在要把过去的时间给追回来。 中华民族复兴指日可待！

终于明白为什么美国勒紧裤腰带也要打华为了

@pengfeiwang9923  是的，看一些报道华为有6万个工程师，虽然未必都有稚晖君这么强，但能入职华为的工程师，在国入都得是名校的工科生，而且华为的股份结构很特别，老板任正非只占0.88%的股份，工会99.12%，公司分红时，全休员工分到99.12%，而且华为不上市，也不缺钱，所以美国从金融手段上也搞不了它

这不是工程师，这是天才！

interesting

这个他说过  不会生孩子。

@bobofeng1852  可惜了 ， 這麼強的基因

@takitslo7812  是他不会生啦，因为他是男的。

@takitslo7812  哈哈哈哈艹耿直boy

他是华为的员工

他是华为2020年“全球天才少年招募计划”的入选者，现在是华为昇腾计算产品线全栈研发工程师。

人和人的差距有时候真的比人和狗差距还大……

简直是奇才，亚洲斯塔克

曾經我以為我是人，現在我覺得我比狗還不如

@min-eq5pr  同感…

我是直接跪了。。。。

就像三体人跟人类的差距，稚晖君面前我只是一只虫子

狗子：你礼貌吗？🐶

过于调皮。。。

Ничего себе заявляет

哈哈哈 神TM回复

@chinabitcoin  这是该视频在新机器人模拟软件中对 DUMMY 机械臂的模拟。我正在寻找合作伙伴/投资者。  https://youtu.be/Qyil8V_SGw0
