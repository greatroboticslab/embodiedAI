[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:04.040] I cut my finger making lunch so I placed an order for some band-aids a couple minutes ago
[00:00:04.040 → 00:00:06.040] and now they're four seconds away.
[00:00:08.560 → 00:00:13.100] That is a nearly silent drone system that can deliver a package from the sky
[00:00:13.100 → 00:00:17.760] right to my backyard in as little as two minutes with dinner plate accuracy.
[00:00:18.160 → 00:00:22.340] And as far as I'm concerned, that's basically teleportation.
[00:00:22.520 → 00:00:26.860] This is the very near future of package delivery from a company called Zipline.
[00:00:26.860 → 00:00:30.960] It's been over a decade since we were first promised drone delivery that looked like this
[00:00:30.960 → 00:00:33.220] and to be honest, I was never that stoked about it
[00:00:33.220 → 00:00:37.160] because I couldn't imagine that anyone would actually want something that big and loud
[00:00:37.160 → 00:00:41.120] with dangerously fast spinning propellers landing anywhere near their house.
[00:00:41.300 → 00:00:44.080] And that was a bummer because with the explosion of people using Amazon
[00:00:44.080 → 00:00:46.640] or food delivery apps like DoorDash or Instacart,
[00:00:46.820 → 00:00:50.020] billions of doorstep deliveries are now happening every year.
[00:00:50.120 → 00:00:51.600] But when your lunch only weighs a few ounces,
[00:00:51.880 → 00:00:54.780] driving it to everyone with these two-ton gas-powered vehicles
[00:00:54.780 → 00:00:57.360] is wildly inefficient, bad for the whole planet,
[00:00:57.540 → 00:00:59.480] and not to mention just really slow.
[00:00:59.600 → 00:01:02.320] Drone delivery would not only take a lot of cars off the road,
[00:01:02.420 → 00:01:04.160] but it would be a lot faster than a car.
[00:01:04.320 → 00:01:06.360] It would be fully electric, fully autonomous,
[00:01:06.640 → 00:01:09.560] and it would cost pennies worth of energy per delivery.
[00:01:09.780 → 00:01:12.380] And with Zipline, because the droid that lowers the package
[00:01:12.380 → 00:01:14.220] can move laterally in any direction,
[00:01:14.440 → 00:01:17.700] it can make a dartboard-sized precision landing even in high winds,
[00:01:17.820 → 00:01:20.880] while the main drone can stay 400 feet up in the sky,
[00:01:20.880 → 00:01:22.880] making the whole thing whisper quiet...
[00:01:22.880 → 00:01:25.660] That is very quiet.
[00:01:25.960 → 00:01:29.580] Also due in part to the clever design of these really funky propellers.
[00:01:29.820 → 00:01:32.660] As you all know, I only make about 10 videos a year,
[00:01:32.800 → 00:01:34.880] and while most are just sort of ridiculous...
[00:01:35.640 → 00:01:43.240] I'd like to dedicate one video to showcase how clever people are using engineering
[00:01:43.240 → 00:01:44.860] to change the world for the better.
[00:01:45.040 → 00:01:47.300] And to be clear, the company I'm talking about today
[00:01:47.300 → 00:01:50.020] is not sponsoring this or paying me in any way.
[00:01:50.140 → 00:01:52.420] I'm just really impressed by the work that they're doing,
[00:01:52.720 → 00:01:53.700] and how they're doing it.
[00:01:53.740 → 00:01:56.960] So we'll circle back in a minute to exactly how they're going to pull off deliveries
[00:01:56.960 → 00:01:58.940] using these short-range drones in a city,
[00:01:59.060 → 00:02:00.240] but it begs the question.
[00:02:00.380 → 00:02:01.520] If they can make it work there,
[00:02:01.640 → 00:02:04.480] why not use gliding drones to cover longer distances
[00:02:04.480 → 00:02:06.500] to deliver critical medical supplies
[00:02:06.500 → 00:02:08.600] for countries with lots of remote villages?
[00:02:08.860 → 00:02:09.760] Well, as it turns out,
[00:02:10.040 → 00:02:12.600] catapulting life-saving blood through the skies
[00:02:12.600 → 00:02:15.440] is what they've already been doing for over six years,
[00:02:15.600 → 00:02:17.400] which is why we need to head out to Rwanda
[00:02:17.400 → 00:02:19.320] to understand where this all started.
[00:02:19.520 → 00:02:21.300] And immediately after showing up,
[00:02:21.380 → 00:02:22.880] we were right in the thick of it,
[00:02:22.940 → 00:02:24.320] as drones were taking off...
[00:02:24.320 → 00:02:24.920] Wow!
[00:02:26.380 → 00:02:27.440] ...and landing...
[00:02:28.100 → 00:02:29.440] That's another one lands!
[00:02:29.660 → 00:02:31.000] ...every 90 seconds.
[00:02:31.200 → 00:02:32.460] They're coming from everywhere.
[00:02:33.540 → 00:02:35.540] And as a newcomer, it felt a bit chaotic,
[00:02:35.680 → 00:02:38.440] but if you're going to rack up 40 million miles worth of drone flights...
[00:02:38.440 → 00:02:44.040] Your team needs to be operating with the efficiency of an F-1 pit crew,
[00:02:44.180 → 00:02:46.420] so here's a crash course on how it all works.
[00:02:46.600 → 00:02:49.460] It all starts with an order coming in from a doctor at a hospital,
[00:02:49.740 → 00:02:52.000] say, for example, for an emergency supply of blood.
[00:02:52.160 → 00:02:53.260] Then once it's all packed up,
[00:02:53.320 → 00:02:55.820] it gets passed out to be placed in the belly of the drone,
[00:02:56.000 → 00:02:57.960] and then the whole thing is placed on the launcher.
[00:02:58.200 → 00:02:59.880] At that point, they attach the wings,
[00:03:00.060 → 00:03:02.580] then secure the battery, followed by the nose cone.
[00:03:02.800 → 00:03:04.360] Then after some pre-flight safety checks,
[00:03:04.360 → 00:03:05.480] they launch the drone,
[00:03:05.480 → 00:03:09.960] all within 90 seconds of the order coming in.
[00:03:10.080 → 00:03:13.860] The catapult launcher takes the drone from 0 to 65 miles an hour
[00:03:13.860 → 00:03:16.000] in a third of a second,
[00:03:16.480 → 00:03:19.660] which is literally less time than it takes you to blink.
[00:03:19.820 → 00:03:21.220] And it's a pretty clever design, too,
[00:03:21.300 → 00:03:24.360] because it means the drone immediately starts at its cruising speed,
[00:03:24.480 → 00:03:27.220] where it takes much less energy to stay airborne.
[00:03:27.500 → 00:03:30.240] Then once it's in the air, cruising at 70 miles per hour,
[00:03:30.340 → 00:03:32.000] it navigates its way to the hospital,
[00:03:32.000 → 00:03:35.580] and upon arriving, opens the trap door to drop the package,
[00:03:35.740 → 00:03:37.860] which lands safely using a parachute.
[00:03:38.040 → 00:03:39.180] Having now completed the mission,
[00:03:39.340 → 00:03:41.220] it continues making all its own decisions
[00:03:41.220 → 00:03:43.220] to autonomously navigate back home
[00:03:43.220 → 00:03:45.980] from as far away as a 150 miles round trip.
[00:03:46.100 → 00:03:48.040] Then taking inspiration from an aircraft carrier,
[00:03:48.180 → 00:03:49.120] as the drone approaches,
[00:03:49.320 → 00:03:53.240] the military-grade GPS broadcasts its position within one centimeter,
[00:03:53.380 → 00:03:55.940] so these two poles know exactly when to swing up
[00:03:55.940 → 00:03:57.500] at the last possible moment,
[00:03:57.500 → 00:04:00.140] snagging a hook on the tail with the cable,
[00:04:00.420 → 00:04:01.940] which safely slows it down.
[00:04:02.960 → 00:04:04.260] Then once it's settled to a stop,
[00:04:04.420 → 00:04:06.880] the crew comes in to remove the battery and wings,
[00:04:07.020 → 00:04:08.500] and it all goes back into rotation.
[00:04:08.740 → 00:04:11.960] The whole thing is really impressive and incredibly robust,
[00:04:12.260 → 00:04:14.540] which means it works in pretty much any weather.
[00:04:14.660 → 00:04:16.020] And because there's no human steering it,
[00:04:16.060 → 00:04:17.700] it has no issues flying at night,
[00:04:17.760 → 00:04:20.100] so they run the operation 24 hours a day,
[00:04:20.180 → 00:04:21.300] which is how in six years,
[00:04:21.300 → 00:04:23.240] they've managed to make those half a million,
[00:04:23.460 → 00:04:25.280] often life-saving deliveries.
[00:04:25.280 → 00:04:29.020] That is the uppermost top of the iceberg tip
[00:04:29.020 → 00:04:30.860] of how they're doing what they're doing.
[00:04:31.000 → 00:04:32.820] But what you should know is six years ago,
[00:04:32.940 → 00:04:35.260] all the experts told them this was a hopeless cause
[00:04:35.260 → 00:04:36.920] and failure was a near certainty,
[00:04:37.320 → 00:04:38.660] and they kind of weren't wrong.
[00:04:38.780 → 00:04:40.160] Building an engineering product takes time,
[00:04:40.280 → 00:04:42.720] so you prototype, you build it,
[00:04:42.800 → 00:04:44.320] and then you fail, and then you try it again,
[00:04:44.380 → 00:04:45.080] and you fail, and you try it again
[00:04:45.080 → 00:04:47.220] until you have this shiny product that you want.
[00:04:47.760 → 00:04:49.600] This is a different type of aircraft.
[00:04:49.880 → 00:04:50.720] This is not what we had.
[00:04:50.820 → 00:04:54.080] The first one used to land on these inflated mattresses.
[00:04:54.080 → 00:04:55.820] The vehicle had a hook on the back,
[00:04:55.920 → 00:04:56.440] the tail.
[00:04:56.660 → 00:04:58.440] The tail would deploy like an aircraft carrier,
[00:04:58.700 → 00:05:00.320] and then the fishing pole would pull it,
[00:05:00.600 → 00:05:01.580] and it would land on the mattress.
[00:05:01.900 → 00:05:03.720] First of all, he's not saying that figuratively.
[00:05:03.940 → 00:05:05.780] They were scrappy in the early days,
[00:05:05.880 → 00:05:08.500] using actual fishing poles as you can see here.
[00:05:08.640 → 00:05:10.080] And secondly, this is Abdul,
[00:05:10.200 → 00:05:11.340] and what you should know about Abdul
[00:05:11.340 → 00:05:12.840] is he grew up in Rwanda,
[00:05:12.980 → 00:05:14.940] not far from where these drones are launching.
[00:05:15.120 → 00:05:16.280] And while he would eventually go on
[00:05:16.280 → 00:05:17.600] to do graduate work in robotics,
[00:05:17.740 → 00:05:19.340] attending both Stanford and Harvard,
[00:05:19.480 → 00:05:20.760] he got his start in engineering
[00:05:20.760 → 00:05:22.380] for much more simple means.
[00:05:22.380 → 00:05:25.960] I remember that I would make cars from milk boxes
[00:05:25.960 → 00:05:27.300] that, you know, was left over.
[00:05:27.460 → 00:05:29.640] You know, we would add tires there and use it as a car.
[00:05:29.760 → 00:05:31.620] Abdul was orphaned as a child
[00:05:31.620 → 00:05:33.200] when he lost both of his parents
[00:05:33.200 → 00:05:36.140] and all three of his siblings in the Rwandan genocide,
[00:05:36.340 → 00:05:37.880] narrowly escaping himself.
[00:05:38.180 → 00:05:40.320] But he didn't give up on his passion for engineering,
[00:05:40.560 → 00:05:41.460] and so as he got older,
[00:05:41.560 → 00:05:43.460] he would go around to all the local hospitals,
[00:05:43.620 → 00:05:45.460] fixing their MRI machines for free,
[00:05:45.540 → 00:05:48.100] using knowledge he gained from watching YouTube videos.
[00:05:48.300 → 00:05:50.780] Abdul was the very first Zipline employee in Rwanda,
[00:05:50.780 → 00:05:53.400] and he really helped to pioneer so many of the systems
[00:05:53.400 → 00:05:54.560] they have in place today
[00:05:54.560 → 00:05:56.120] that are now used all over the world.
[00:05:56.280 → 00:05:58.700] And so in an effort to test those very systems,
[00:05:59.000 → 00:06:00.720] I wanted to see if it was robust enough
[00:06:00.720 → 00:06:02.280] that even a total doob like me
[00:06:02.280 → 00:06:03.500] could send out an order.
[00:06:03.700 → 00:06:05.760] Oh, we got one.
[00:06:06.260 → 00:06:06.740] Panic!
[00:06:07.200 → 00:06:07.980] Don't worry.
[00:06:08.120 → 00:06:09.000] Don't worry, okay.
[00:06:09.220 → 00:06:09.900] Gloves, okay.
[00:06:10.360 → 00:06:11.100] Good enough.
[00:06:11.320 → 00:06:12.560] This is where the blood is, right?
[00:06:12.660 → 00:06:13.120] O positive.
[00:06:13.220 → 00:06:14.020] It's O positive.
[00:06:14.360 → 00:06:14.520] Yeah.
[00:06:14.740 → 00:06:16.840] I feel like I shouldn't be touching this.
[00:06:16.960 → 00:06:17.540] Stay calm.
[00:06:17.540 → 00:06:18.640] That's the number one rule.
[00:06:18.780 → 00:06:19.400] Now you scan.
[00:06:19.540 → 00:06:20.160] Scan it.
[00:06:20.460 → 00:06:21.540] Do six wraps.
[00:06:21.900 → 00:06:22.460] Like this?
[00:06:22.700 → 00:06:22.980] Two.
[00:06:23.760 → 00:06:24.120] Three.
[00:06:24.200 → 00:06:24.480] Two.
[00:06:25.120 → 00:06:25.600] Five.
[00:06:25.840 → 00:06:26.100] Okay.
[00:06:31.380 → 00:06:33.000] Just out here saving lives.
[00:06:33.340 → 00:06:34.460] And once I ring the bell,
[00:06:34.740 → 00:06:36.900] it's the drone team's problem.
[00:06:37.720 → 00:06:38.060] Okay.
[00:06:38.480 → 00:06:39.240] What do I do?
[00:06:39.380 → 00:06:40.520] Check this with no tango.
[00:06:40.740 → 00:06:41.520] And push it here.
[00:06:41.700 → 00:06:42.340] Out of my way.
[00:06:42.400 → 00:06:43.120] Coming through.
[00:06:43.380 → 00:06:43.920] The wings.
[00:06:44.100 → 00:06:44.560] How's that?
[00:06:44.920 → 00:06:45.320] Battery!
[00:06:45.720 → 00:06:46.600] We're trying to be picked.
[00:06:46.600 → 00:06:47.340] There's so many.
[00:06:49.280 → 00:06:51.800] So after a final check of the drone's condition.
[00:06:52.040 → 00:06:54.640] A little bit of a look to the right and cough.
[00:06:59.020 → 00:07:00.480] We had liftoff.
[00:07:01.380 → 00:07:02.160] I'm a hero.
[00:07:02.840 → 00:07:03.720] We did it.
[00:07:04.260 → 00:07:06.480] I just like saved a life basically.
[00:07:07.700 → 00:07:08.140] Wow.
[00:07:08.980 → 00:07:11.060] How do you guys do this all day long?
[00:07:11.320 → 00:07:13.700] So now that I had a pretty good feel for the launch site,
[00:07:13.700 → 00:07:17.200] we headed out to see where some of these drones were actually flying to.
[00:07:17.340 → 00:07:19.620] So we left the launch site like three and a half hours ago.
[00:07:19.700 → 00:07:22.700] We're driving to this remote hospital on these really windy roads.
[00:07:22.980 → 00:07:23.880] And as we've been driving,
[00:07:24.060 → 00:07:26.340] we've been tracking and seeing some of these zipline drones
[00:07:26.340 → 00:07:29.120] delivering blood and medical supplies to this hospital.
[00:07:29.340 → 00:07:30.620] So since we're about a half hour out,
[00:07:30.680 → 00:07:33.080] I thought it would be fun to place my own emergency order.
[00:07:33.220 → 00:07:34.860] Then it could meet us when we get there.
[00:07:34.860 → 00:07:37.540] Because when you need extra ointment,
[00:07:37.820 → 00:07:38.900] you just need extra ointment.
[00:07:39.260 → 00:07:39.880] And sure enough,
[00:07:40.000 → 00:07:41.440] a few minutes after arriving,
[00:07:41.620 → 00:07:44.100] I got a notification for an incoming package.
[00:07:44.440 → 00:07:48.640] This is wild because we're like four hours away on some really windy roads.
[00:07:50.400 → 00:07:51.360] I got it!
[00:07:55.500 → 00:07:55.900] Close!
[00:07:56.400 → 00:07:57.360] So close!
[00:07:57.600 → 00:08:00.160] And so after opening the package and checking their handiwork,
[00:08:00.160 → 00:08:03.120] I asked if I could speak to a few of the doctors.
[00:08:03.680 → 00:08:05.180] When's the last time you delivered a baby?
[00:08:05.500 → 00:08:07.200] In a few minutes ago.
[00:08:07.440 → 00:08:08.160] A few minutes ago?
[00:08:09.140 → 00:08:10.380] That's pretty fresh.
[00:08:11.040 → 00:08:12.200] For the doctors,
[00:08:12.580 → 00:08:14.080] it was like a miracle.
[00:08:14.420 → 00:08:15.220] With zipline,
[00:08:15.380 → 00:08:17.760] we are sure that in 15 to 20 minutes,
[00:08:17.840 → 00:08:19.200] we are going to get what we need.
[00:08:19.400 → 00:08:21.680] And you are sure that patient will be saved.
[00:08:21.780 → 00:08:24.260] But it wasn't just the doctors who were big on zipline.
[00:08:24.380 → 00:08:26.240] I also spoke with a handful of patients
[00:08:26.240 → 00:08:27.680] who for various different reasons
[00:08:27.680 → 00:08:30.780] are all alive today because of a zipline delivery.
[00:08:31.480 → 00:08:33.380] Every time when I see the drones around,
[00:08:33.620 → 00:08:36.720] I just think that someone's life is going to be saved.
[00:08:36.840 → 00:08:37.820] And that's kind of true
[00:08:37.820 → 00:08:39.240] because their drones have reduced
[00:08:39.240 → 00:08:42.740] in-hospital maternal mortality by 88%.
[00:08:42.740 → 00:08:44.220] Zipline has two launch sites
[00:08:44.220 → 00:08:46.700] that give them coverage for pretty much anywhere in Rwanda,
[00:08:46.880 → 00:08:49.560] but they also have operations running in all of these countries.
[00:08:49.840 → 00:08:52.660] And while they serve 3,000 hospitals globally today,
[00:08:52.780 → 00:08:55.300] that number will be 10,000 by the end of the year.
[00:08:55.300 → 00:08:58.480] All right, so we've covered their long-range country delivery drones,
[00:08:58.620 → 00:08:59.960] which means we've now got the context
[00:08:59.960 → 00:09:02.720] to talk about their short-range city delivery drones.
[00:09:02.840 → 00:09:04.940] But first, I just have to interject here
[00:09:04.940 → 00:09:08.360] and say I was blown away by Rwanda as a country.
[00:09:08.600 → 00:09:09.560] I mean, right out of the gate,
[00:09:09.660 → 00:09:11.200] their stoplights are really cool
[00:09:11.200 → 00:09:12.680] because they're just countdowns
[00:09:12.680 → 00:09:13.760] till the light turns green.
[00:09:13.940 → 00:09:17.520] They can balance and carry pretty much anything on their heads.
[00:09:17.660 → 00:09:19.680] And there's motorcycle taxis everywhere.
[00:09:19.880 → 00:09:21.160] And given that win in Rwanda,
[00:09:21.280 → 00:09:22.620] you do as the Rwandans do,
[00:09:22.620 → 00:09:25.540] whenever possible, that's how we got around ourselves.
[00:09:25.720 → 00:09:26.940] What a freaking lose.
[00:09:27.680 → 00:09:30.760] Everyone was also super friendly everywhere we went.
[00:09:30.860 → 00:09:31.880] Well, not everyone,
[00:09:32.160 → 00:09:34.680] because if you stop to play soccer with some random kids,
[00:09:34.860 → 00:09:36.800] Am I good? Am I good?
[00:09:37.240 → 00:09:39.460] just know they're not going to take it easy on you.
[00:09:39.520 → 00:09:39.720] What?
[00:09:40.940 → 00:09:42.960] Besides the fact that Messi seems to like it,
[00:09:43.180 → 00:09:44.180] before traveling there,
[00:09:44.240 → 00:09:46.220] the only real thing I knew about Rwanda
[00:09:46.220 → 00:09:49.480] was the Rwanda genocide that took place about 30 years ago.
[00:09:49.480 → 00:09:52.080] And while there are still plenty of battle scars,
[00:09:52.280 → 00:09:53.700] as horrific as that was,
[00:09:53.900 → 00:09:55.420] it sort of galvanized the country
[00:09:55.420 → 00:09:57.520] into a period of healing and solidarity
[00:09:57.520 → 00:09:59.240] as a single Rwandan people
[00:09:59.240 → 00:10:01.200] instead of divisive ethnic groups.
[00:10:01.360 → 00:10:02.980] For example, on the last Saturday of the month,
[00:10:03.160 → 00:10:04.820] literally everyone spends the day
[00:10:04.820 → 00:10:05.720] picking up trash
[00:10:05.720 → 00:10:07.600] and volunteering in their local communities.
[00:10:07.760 → 00:10:08.680] And that's one of the reasons
[00:10:08.680 → 00:10:10.220] you hardly see litter anywhere.
[00:10:10.360 → 00:10:11.840] The other one being 15 years ago,
[00:10:12.040 → 00:10:13.360] they were one of the first countries
[00:10:13.360 → 00:10:15.300] to ban all single-use plastics.
[00:10:15.620 → 00:10:18.120] There was just a pervasive optimism in the air.
[00:10:18.120 → 00:10:19.820] Everyone was moving with the purpose
[00:10:19.820 → 00:10:21.120] everywhere we went.
[00:10:21.260 → 00:10:22.220] Not just working hard,
[00:10:22.360 → 00:10:25.040] but working smart with their resources on hand.
[00:10:25.120 → 00:10:25.840] Yeah, buddy!
[00:10:26.480 → 00:10:28.700] Including their improvised soccer balls.
[00:10:29.020 → 00:10:29.820] For over a decade,
[00:10:30.000 → 00:10:31.540] attending school up to age 16
[00:10:31.540 → 00:10:33.700] has been both mandatory and free.
[00:10:33.900 → 00:10:34.860] And when you combine that
[00:10:34.860 → 00:10:36.820] with leapfrogging to new technologies
[00:10:36.820 → 00:10:37.740] like drone delivery,
[00:10:37.900 → 00:10:38.660] for the last decade,
[00:10:38.840 → 00:10:40.100] their economy has been growing
[00:10:40.100 → 00:10:42.540] at four times the rate of the U.S. economy,
[00:10:42.720 → 00:10:43.800] while their violent crime rate
[00:10:43.800 → 00:10:45.920] has been 15 times less than the U.S.
[00:10:45.920 → 00:10:46.720] And finally,
[00:10:46.940 → 00:10:48.840] the most unducing part of the whole trip
[00:10:48.840 → 00:10:49.840] was when I hiked to see
[00:10:49.840 → 00:10:51.820] an entire family of mountain gorillas
[00:10:51.820 → 00:10:53.500] up close in the wild,
[00:10:53.740 → 00:10:56.320] which was equal parts adorable and terrifying.
[00:10:56.520 → 00:10:57.860] I think he's looking at me.
[00:10:58.060 → 00:10:59.380] Mountain gorillas only exist
[00:10:59.380 → 00:11:01.260] in these two tiny red regions.
[00:11:01.600 → 00:11:03.400] And while there's only a thousand left in the world,
[00:11:03.660 → 00:11:05.560] I got to just chill with 20 of them.
[00:11:05.640 → 00:11:06.880] They're critically endangered,
[00:11:07.160 → 00:11:08.980] but thanks to Rwandan conservation efforts
[00:11:08.980 → 00:11:11.180] funded by people paying for brief visits like this,
[00:11:11.300 → 00:11:13.100] their numbers have climbed by 200
[00:11:13.100 → 00:11:14.520] over the past decade.
[00:11:14.520 → 00:11:16.040] All that's to say that besides,
[00:11:16.160 → 00:11:17.080] of course, my own country,
[00:11:17.220 → 00:11:19.420] Rwanda is my new second favorite country.
[00:11:19.540 → 00:11:20.040] We got this.
[00:11:20.220 → 00:11:21.200] And next time I go back,
[00:11:21.300 → 00:11:22.920] I'm bringing a bunch of soccer balls,
[00:11:23.040 → 00:11:23.660] Oh, yes!
[00:11:23.800 → 00:11:25.340] which I will give away to any kid
[00:11:25.340 → 00:11:27.280] who just promises not to embarrass me.
[00:11:29.040 → 00:11:31.020] Okay, so now let's talk a little bit more
[00:11:31.020 → 00:11:33.300] about these new short-range city drones.
[00:11:33.360 → 00:11:35.540] Because for the 4 billion doorstep deliveries
[00:11:35.540 → 00:11:37.140] that will happen this year in the U.S.,
[00:11:37.140 → 00:11:39.620] and that number doesn't even include Amazon, by the way,
[00:11:39.700 → 00:11:41.000] why not at least try and take
[00:11:41.000 → 00:11:45.520] some of those slow-moving traffic causing two-ton gas-guzzling cars off the road
[00:11:45.520 → 00:11:47.460] in exchange for a much faster delivery
[00:11:47.460 → 00:11:50.920] that's also electric, autonomous, really quiet, and zero emissions.
[00:11:51.180 → 00:11:52.900] And while there's a solution of dropping down a droid
[00:11:52.900 → 00:11:55.580] that could perfectly control its landing from super high up,
[00:11:55.640 → 00:11:56.280] seemed promising,
[00:11:56.500 → 00:11:59.020] and way better than something like this that had been proposed before,
[00:11:59.020 → 00:12:00.560] when they first told me about it,
[00:12:00.640 → 00:12:02.040] I had two main questions.
[00:12:02.280 → 00:12:04.400] One, how loud and disruptive are they?
[00:12:04.460 → 00:12:08.620] Because the last thing we want are annoying drones buzzing by our rooftops all day.
[00:12:08.620 → 00:12:10.380] And two, how safe are they?
[00:12:10.480 → 00:12:13.140] Because the other last thing we want is for those same annoying drones
[00:12:13.140 → 00:12:15.460] to start falling down on us from the sky.
[00:12:15.640 → 00:12:16.940] I also had a bonus third question
[00:12:16.940 → 00:12:20.580] around how a business is even supposed to load in their items for delivery.
[00:12:20.780 → 00:12:21.840] And so in a search for answers,
[00:12:22.060 → 00:12:23.320] I went right to their headquarters,
[00:12:23.540 → 00:12:25.640] not that far down the road from where I live.
[00:12:25.740 → 00:12:26.980] And the first thing you notice in the lobby
[00:12:26.980 → 00:12:28.520] is this really cool projection
[00:12:28.520 → 00:12:31.080] that not only shows the total number of flights they've flown,
[00:12:31.180 → 00:12:32.220] now at over half a million,
[00:12:32.360 → 00:12:34.940] but it also shows all the long-range drones they have in the air
[00:12:34.940 → 00:12:36.200] at that exact moment,
[00:12:36.200 → 00:12:39.060] delivering those critical medical supplies all around the world.
[00:12:39.260 → 00:12:42.120] And this isn't now just where they design and build all their drones.
[00:12:42.380 → 00:12:44.160] It's also where they do a lot of their testing.
[00:12:44.360 → 00:12:47.980] And they test pretty much everything in every way possible
[00:12:47.980 → 00:12:51.220] before getting it out to the field as quickly as possible.
[00:12:51.380 → 00:12:52.680] And according to their CEO, Keller,
[00:12:52.840 → 00:12:54.740] this is something they discovered early on.
[00:12:54.840 → 00:12:57.180] Our key insight was we were dumb
[00:12:57.180 → 00:12:59.660] and we basically always assumed we were dumb.
[00:12:59.780 → 00:13:01.280] And for that reason, when we designed things,
[00:13:01.280 → 00:13:03.500] we got them into the real world super fast
[00:13:03.500 → 00:13:05.400] and learned by serving real people.
[00:13:05.560 → 00:13:07.500] And you learn so much
[00:13:07.500 → 00:13:09.880] that you can't learn in a lab or in an ivory tower.
[00:13:10.020 → 00:13:13.440] And so before we actually hear just how quiet these things are,
[00:13:13.580 → 00:13:16.640] I just want to echo that all the best engineers I've ever known
[00:13:16.640 → 00:13:18.480] have had that same level of humility,
[00:13:18.720 → 00:13:20.400] knowing there's no better way to learn
[00:13:20.400 → 00:13:22.200] than to test and to break stuff.
[00:13:22.420 → 00:13:24.120] That's why I named the toy company I started
[00:13:24.120 → 00:13:25.980] that has the express goal of teaching kids
[00:13:25.980 → 00:13:27.940] to think like engineers Crunch Labs.
[00:13:27.940 → 00:13:29.900] It's because things are supposed to crunch
[00:13:29.900 → 00:13:31.860] and to break and to fail along the way.
[00:13:32.000 → 00:13:33.420] And so if I could get them to do more
[00:13:33.420 → 00:13:34.940] than just passively watch a video
[00:13:34.940 → 00:13:37.160] by building something alongside me
[00:13:37.160 → 00:13:39.360] while we talk about the physics of what's going on,
[00:13:39.420 → 00:13:41.680] then I know the principles will really sink in.
[00:13:41.980 → 00:13:43.720] So if you want to have a ton of fun
[00:13:43.720 → 00:13:46.800] while building up that resiliency in your brain like a muscle,
[00:13:47.000 → 00:13:49.140] just head to crunchlabs.com
[00:13:49.140 → 00:13:50.620] or use the link in the video description.
[00:13:51.000 → 00:13:53.720] All right, so to answer my first question on the noise level,
[00:13:53.720 → 00:13:56.100] I'll just show you my actual reaction
[00:13:56.100 → 00:13:57.620] to the first time I heard it.
[00:13:57.620 → 00:13:59.100] I mean, I hear something.
[00:14:01.080 → 00:14:03.420] I cannot believe that's airborne.
[00:14:03.640 → 00:14:04.620] Are you serious?
[00:14:05.000 → 00:14:06.260] And I just wish there was a better way
[00:14:06.260 → 00:14:07.180] to convey this on video,
[00:14:07.340 → 00:14:08.560] but here's my best attempt.
[00:14:08.780 → 00:14:10.080] You'll first hear a leaf blower,
[00:14:10.260 → 00:14:12.420] then a typical hobby drone that weighs one pound,
[00:14:12.560 → 00:14:14.860] then their drone that weighs 50 pounds.
[00:14:15.020 → 00:14:16.620] And of course, I've kept the audio levels
[00:14:16.620 → 00:14:18.340] completely untouched for all three.
[00:14:25.160 → 00:14:26.920] That is whisper quiet.
[00:14:26.920 → 00:14:28.920] That is very quiet.
[00:14:31.380 → 00:14:35.740] That cow is way louder than that drone.
[00:14:36.420 → 00:14:38.740] I bet the mic picked up that cow.
[00:14:39.020 → 00:14:41.320] And this test was incredibly surprising to me
[00:14:41.320 → 00:14:43.800] because I sort of just assumed the weight of a thing
[00:14:43.800 → 00:14:46.320] would exactly determine how loud the propellers
[00:14:46.320 → 00:14:49.160] will end up being to keep that thing in the air.
[00:14:49.240 → 00:14:50.940] But it turns out that's not actually true
[00:14:50.940 → 00:14:52.420] even if you just look at nature.
[00:14:52.600 → 00:14:54.560] Pigeons, for example, sound like this.
[00:14:54.560 → 00:14:58.380] But with owls, there's an evolutionary pressure
[00:14:58.380 → 00:14:59.840] to be as quiet as possible.
[00:14:59.960 → 00:15:02.460] And as a result, their flight sounds like this.
[00:15:04.160 → 00:15:06.060] For this reason, to crack the code,
[00:15:06.240 → 00:15:07.940] Zipline actually did turn to nature.
[00:15:07.940 → 00:15:09.820] I study the hummingbird a lot where you have...
[00:15:09.820 → 00:15:10.260] Oh, sure.
[00:15:10.340 → 00:15:11.100] They have the worst case.
[00:15:11.180 → 00:15:12.640] They're tiny and they're really quiet.
[00:15:12.780 → 00:15:14.200] They just like hover there.
[00:15:14.260 → 00:15:14.760] You barely hear it.
[00:15:14.780 → 00:15:15.680] By the way, that's Kenan.
[00:15:15.760 → 00:15:17.120] He's another Zipline co-founder.
[00:15:17.320 → 00:15:18.520] And for you robotics nerds,
[00:15:18.560 → 00:15:19.960] he's the dude who invented ROS,
[00:15:20.040 → 00:15:21.260] which is the open source software
[00:15:21.260 → 00:15:22.560] used by basically anyone
[00:15:22.560 → 00:15:24.540] who wants to build anything robotic.
[00:15:24.740 → 00:15:26.020] So in an effort to try and visualize
[00:15:26.020 → 00:15:27.800] the secret of their quiet propellers,
[00:15:27.940 → 00:15:29.600] in this graph, the area under the curve
[00:15:29.600 → 00:15:30.860] could represent the energy
[00:15:30.860 → 00:15:31.980] from one of those annoying,
[00:15:32.160 → 00:15:33.560] high-pitched hobby drones,
[00:15:33.560 → 00:15:35.060] where the closest of these spikes
[00:15:35.060 → 00:15:36.320] is the high frequency
[00:15:36.320 → 00:15:38.300] that's just sort of grating on your ears.
[00:15:38.440 → 00:15:39.700] So after studying the hummingbird
[00:15:39.700 → 00:15:42.240] and designing really wild-looking rotors like this,
[00:15:42.420 → 00:15:44.220] Zipline figured out how to take those spikes
[00:15:44.220 → 00:15:45.920] and flatten them all out.
[00:15:46.080 → 00:15:47.300] So while the extra weight means
[00:15:47.300 → 00:15:49.720] there's still more energy or area under the curve,
[00:15:49.900 → 00:15:50.960] getting rid of all the spikes
[00:15:50.960 → 00:15:53.780] means it's much more of a constant whooshing sound,
[00:15:53.880 → 00:15:54.920] more like white noise
[00:15:54.920 → 00:15:56.640] that your brain just sort of doesn't register.
[00:15:56.980 → 00:15:58.800] They use the same quiet propeller approach
[00:15:58.800 → 00:15:59.960] for their long-range drones.
[00:16:00.040 → 00:16:01.200] As you can tell from this doctor
[00:16:01.200 → 00:16:03.260] with an impeccable taste in YouTube content,
[00:16:03.260 → 00:16:04.480] who just wanted to say hi.
[00:16:04.580 → 00:16:05.400] You've seen my videos.
[00:16:05.500 → 00:16:06.540] Now you could be in one.
[00:16:07.780 → 00:16:09.640] Have you seen the planes fly over
[00:16:09.640 → 00:16:11.000] and deliver the supplies here?
[00:16:11.160 → 00:16:13.220] I have not yet seen one come
[00:16:13.220 → 00:16:15.440] and deposit something here.
[00:16:15.600 → 00:16:16.320] That's amazing.
[00:16:16.620 → 00:16:19.500] There was just 15 deliveries in the last hour.
[00:16:19.640 → 00:16:20.280] They're really quiet.
[00:16:20.420 → 00:16:22.120] If I would have heard it,
[00:16:22.140 → 00:16:24.060] I would have, you know, gone to see it.
[00:16:24.100 → 00:16:25.560] For my second question regarding safety,
[00:16:25.760 → 00:16:27.440] just like when sending something to Mars,
[00:16:27.560 → 00:16:29.800] all their critical systems have backups on board.
[00:16:29.940 → 00:16:31.660] In engineering, we call this redundancy,
[00:16:31.840 → 00:16:33.160] and they even demonstrated for us
[00:16:33.160 → 00:16:34.580] how if one propeller stops working,
[00:16:34.720 → 00:16:36.320] it could still fly due in part
[00:16:36.320 → 00:16:38.580] to the large back propeller that picks up the slack.
[00:16:38.800 → 00:16:40.960] And that back propeller is pretty clever, by the way,
[00:16:41.020 → 00:16:42.680] because it's what propels the drone forward
[00:16:42.680 → 00:16:43.880] as it moves across town,
[00:16:44.020 → 00:16:45.760] but then it turns down 90 degrees
[00:16:45.760 → 00:16:47.640] to help steer and create extra lift
[00:16:47.640 → 00:16:49.960] while it's stationary and dropping down the droid.
[00:16:50.100 → 00:16:51.420] In addition to the redundancy,
[00:16:51.560 → 00:16:54.500] a whole aircraft parachute is automatically deployed
[00:16:54.500 → 00:16:56.100] if there is a problem that's sensed
[00:16:56.100 → 00:16:58.300] or if the drone just loses power altogether.
[00:16:58.620 → 00:17:01.000] And because of their painstaking engineering efforts,
[00:17:01.000 → 00:17:02.920] it's worth noting in the six years
[00:17:02.920 → 00:17:05.540] they've been operating for those half a million flights,
[00:17:05.680 → 00:17:08.740] they've had exactly zero incidents causing any injury.
[00:17:08.860 → 00:17:10.340] As for my third bonus question
[00:17:10.340 → 00:17:11.900] around how the drones get loaded up,
[00:17:11.980 → 00:17:12.800] in the most simple case,
[00:17:12.880 → 00:17:14.020] something like a grocery store
[00:17:14.020 → 00:17:16.480] could reserve some parking spots as a loading zone.
[00:17:16.600 → 00:17:18.480] Or as one of the zipline engineers told me,
[00:17:18.560 → 00:17:20.360] you can take a window from your local pharmacy
[00:17:20.360 → 00:17:22.000] and turn it into this portal.
[00:17:22.320 → 00:17:24.000] So the droid would come down the chute,
[00:17:24.140 → 00:17:27.180] then some ASAP items like these would get loaded inside,
[00:17:27.180 → 00:17:29.580] then it goes back up the chute into the drone
[00:17:29.580 → 00:17:30.740] and off for delivery.
[00:17:31.000 → 00:17:32.560] For healthcare, if you were really sick
[00:17:32.560 → 00:17:35.080] and say on a 15 minute video call with your doctor,
[00:17:35.260 → 00:17:36.540] by the time the call was ending,
[00:17:36.720 → 00:17:38.820] your medications could be on your back porch
[00:17:38.820 → 00:17:40.220] so you don't have to leave your house.
[00:17:40.400 → 00:17:42.020] You could also imagine how this could work
[00:17:42.020 → 00:17:44.560] with a distribution center or a large retail store.
[00:17:44.740 → 00:17:46.380] More than 90% of people in the US
[00:17:46.380 → 00:17:49.000] live within 10 miles of a large retail store
[00:17:49.000 → 00:17:50.580] and zipline drones conveniently
[00:17:50.580 → 00:17:52.220] can make a 10 mile round trip
[00:17:52.220 → 00:17:53.800] while carrying up to eight pounds.
[00:17:53.980 → 00:17:55.340] An additional way for the planet here
[00:17:55.340 → 00:17:57.900] is you don't need to use all the cardboard to box it up
[00:17:57.900 → 00:17:59.300] because it doesn't have to survive
[00:17:59.300 → 00:18:01.060] being shipped out on a big truck.
[00:18:01.300 → 00:18:02.800] But this isn't just for big stores.
[00:18:02.940 → 00:18:04.700] Your favorite local shop or restaurant
[00:18:04.700 → 00:18:07.820] can now more easily afford to send a thing to your door,
[00:18:07.980 → 00:18:09.960] but at an ostensibly much lower cost
[00:18:09.960 → 00:18:13.280] than a person driving a 3,000 pound car to drop it off.
[00:18:13.400 → 00:18:14.740] And as soon as by the end of this year,
[00:18:14.940 → 00:18:16.300] customers such as Sweetgreen
[00:18:16.300 → 00:18:19.220] will start delivering salads straight to your backyard.
[00:18:19.440 → 00:18:21.260] And not having packages left on front porches
[00:18:21.260 → 00:18:23.580] is the worst news to hit the porch pirate community
[00:18:23.580 → 00:18:25.420] since the invention of the glitter bomb.
[00:18:25.620 → 00:18:27.000] Oh, you f***.
[00:18:29.040 → 00:18:29.860] All right, all right.
[00:18:29.940 → 00:18:31.100] We f***ing get it, okay.
[00:18:31.540 → 00:18:33.600] All right, so if your mind isn't already blown,
[00:18:33.800 → 00:18:36.340] let me try one final time by planting a seed
[00:18:36.340 → 00:18:38.980] for something we might see much further in the future.
[00:18:39.120 → 00:18:41.580] And to be clear, this is not at all from Zipline.
[00:18:41.660 → 00:18:43.740] It's just an idea that won't leave my head
[00:18:43.740 → 00:18:44.980] after seeing all this
[00:18:44.980 → 00:18:46.300] because it stands to reason
[00:18:46.300 → 00:18:48.420] if the system can work for packages,
[00:18:48.420 → 00:18:51.260] it should be able to work for humans, right?
[00:18:51.260 → 00:18:53.360] In other words, imagine a bigger drone.
[00:18:53.480 → 00:18:54.520] Let's say it's an ambulance
[00:18:54.520 → 00:18:57.160] with more powerful but equally quiet propellers
[00:18:57.160 → 00:19:00.140] parked so high up in the sky you can hardly see it.
[00:19:00.180 → 00:19:02.840] Then it lowers the entire cockpit like the droid,
[00:19:02.940 → 00:19:05.320] which could quietly touch down in your driveway.
[00:19:05.540 → 00:19:08.000] So you hop in or they put you in on the ground,
[00:19:08.220 → 00:19:09.380] then it reels you in
[00:19:09.380 → 00:19:12.000] so you can glide above roads and traffic
[00:19:12.000 → 00:19:13.420] straight to your destination
[00:19:13.420 → 00:19:16.320] only to be dropped off safely in the same manner.
[00:19:16.460 → 00:19:17.300] All right, so finally,
[00:19:17.300 → 00:19:19.760] I just want to wrap up with the coolest part
[00:19:19.760 → 00:19:21.240] of all of this by far.
[00:19:21.380 → 00:19:22.400] The whole time we were there,
[00:19:22.560 → 00:19:24.100] kids would be lined up at the fence
[00:19:24.100 → 00:19:25.740] to watch the drones be launched
[00:19:25.740 → 00:19:27.500] and captured over and over.
[00:19:27.760 → 00:19:29.120] In fact, one kid came up
[00:19:29.120 → 00:19:31.060] specifically wanting to show Abdul
[00:19:31.060 → 00:19:33.300] what he built completely on his own.
[00:19:33.400 → 00:19:34.300] And in that moment,
[00:19:34.480 → 00:19:36.300] it was impossible not to compare
[00:19:36.300 → 00:19:37.900] the complexity of this build
[00:19:37.900 → 00:19:39.880] to the simple milk carton version
[00:19:39.880 → 00:19:41.240] Abdul grew up making.
[00:19:41.520 → 00:19:43.040] Because here you have Abdul,
[00:19:43.200 → 00:19:45.140] who bears a scar on his head
[00:19:45.140 → 00:19:48.040] from the same machete that killed his entire family
[00:19:48.040 → 00:19:48.880] as a child,
[00:19:49.000 → 00:19:51.160] not only using his engineering knowledge
[00:19:51.160 → 00:19:52.880] to save the lives of his people,
[00:19:53.060 → 00:19:54.120] but more importantly,
[00:19:54.400 → 00:19:57.080] to inspire the next generation of problem solvers
[00:19:57.080 → 00:19:58.560] to dream even bigger.
[00:19:58.780 → 00:19:59.800] It's the type of thing
[00:19:59.800 → 00:20:01.600] that leaves you feeling a little bit
[00:20:01.600 → 00:20:03.640] of that contagious Rwandan optimism
[00:20:03.640 → 00:20:04.460] for the future
[00:20:04.460 → 00:20:05.980] and the incredible potential
[00:20:05.980 → 00:20:07.680] of us mere humans.
[00:20:07.680 → 00:20:12.280] In the future,
[00:20:12.660 → 00:20:13.800] your Crunch Labs box
[00:20:13.800 → 00:20:16.600] just might come from the sky.
[00:20:16.720 → 00:20:17.960] And the best part of Abdul's story
[00:20:17.960 → 00:20:20.040] is how using the superpower of engineering,
[00:20:20.320 → 00:20:22.380] they literally wield something into existence
[00:20:22.380 → 00:20:24.120] that is now saving lives.
[00:20:25.800 → 00:20:27.640] And as it says on the box,
[00:20:27.840 → 00:20:29.040] my goal with Crunch Labs
[00:20:29.040 → 00:20:31.360] is to help you think like an engineer.
[00:20:31.600 → 00:20:33.360] That means you know how to think critically
[00:20:33.360 → 00:20:35.940] and break a problem down into manageable steps.
[00:20:35.940 → 00:20:37.120] Thinking like an engineer
[00:20:37.120 → 00:20:38.800] makes you a better soccer player
[00:20:38.800 → 00:20:40.220] or piano practicer
[00:20:40.220 → 00:20:41.340] or math studier
[00:20:41.340 → 00:20:42.340] because you're resilient.
[00:20:42.560 → 00:20:43.420] And just like Abdul,
[00:20:43.760 → 00:20:45.520] you know the importance of failing a bunch
[00:20:45.520 → 00:20:47.420] before you finally get that breakthrough.
[00:20:48.580 → 00:20:49.600] So the way it works
[00:20:49.600 → 00:20:50.480] is every month,
[00:20:50.580 → 00:20:52.960] a really fun toy comes in a box like this.
[00:20:53.100 → 00:20:53.940] And when you open it,
[00:20:54.000 → 00:20:55.020] there's a link to a video
[00:20:55.020 → 00:20:56.960] where you not only build it alongside me,
[00:20:57.080 → 00:20:59.220] but I teach you all the juicy physics principles
[00:20:59.220 → 00:21:00.740] behind how the toy works.
[00:21:00.900 → 00:21:01.780] And the best part of all
[00:21:01.780 → 00:21:02.440] is each month,
[00:21:02.520 → 00:21:04.060] we randomly select one box
[00:21:04.060 → 00:21:05.160] to slip in a platinum ticket.
[00:21:05.160 → 00:21:06.620] And if it happens to be your box,
[00:21:06.740 → 00:21:07.700] Oh my gosh!
[00:21:07.740 → 00:21:08.480] Oh my gosh!
[00:21:09.940 → 00:21:10.880] Then you're coming out
[00:21:10.880 → 00:21:12.040] right here to Crunch Labs
[00:21:12.040 → 00:21:13.820] to design with me and my team for a day.
[00:21:13.980 → 00:21:15.500] So if you want to unlock the superpower
[00:21:15.500 → 00:21:16.840] of learning to create and build
[00:21:16.840 → 00:21:17.980] whatever you could dream up,
[00:21:18.120 → 00:21:19.300] use the link in the video description
[00:21:19.300 → 00:21:21.000] or go to crunchlabs.com
[00:21:21.000 → 00:21:23.260] and order your build box subscription today.
[00:21:23.560 → 00:21:24.260] Thanks for watching.
