[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:06.960] Hello and welcome to the video. This is a video all about flight controllers and it's aimed at
[00:00:06.960 → 00:00:11.820] those of you that have had nothing to do with flight controllers but have been trying to watch
[00:00:11.820 → 00:00:16.560] some of my other series and may be getting lost very quickly. Now this was really brought home
[00:00:16.560 → 00:00:22.080] the need for this video over the past week or so with two incidents. First of all I've been working
[00:00:22.080 → 00:00:28.200] here in my man cave with a friend of mine and we're building him an autonomous wing. He's just
[00:00:28.200 → 00:00:34.080] recently learnt to fly FPV and now he wants to have all that iNav goodness so he can do GPS return
[00:00:34.080 → 00:00:40.920] to home. He wants an on-screen display but we didn't have a model for him that would work like that.
[00:00:41.160 → 00:00:46.200] So what he asked was when you're building it can I kind of come and sit with you and you can explain
[00:00:46.200 → 00:00:50.120] what you're doing and how it all works. I thought you know what that's really interesting because I
[00:00:50.120 → 00:00:55.260] don't have a video for that and that was followed up only the other day by a patron of mine kind of
[00:00:55.260 → 00:01:00.240] getting in touch just saying look I love all the videos and stuff but the build videos I get
[00:01:00.240 → 00:01:06.300] completely lost. So if you know anything about flight controllers or have done any flight controller
[00:01:06.300 → 00:01:11.560] setups and you've followed along and done any builds then you know what this video isn't for you go and
[00:01:11.560 → 00:01:18.660] do something else and watch something more useful. If however you are one of those pilots that watch a lot
[00:01:18.660 → 00:01:26.700] are videos on things like flight controllers, iNav, Betaflight, ArduPilot with planes, quadcopters,
[00:01:26.840 → 00:01:32.520] multi-rotors and you're desperately trying to follow along but it's all not making a lot of sense
[00:01:32.520 → 00:01:37.100] then stay with me. This video is exactly aimed at you.
[00:01:38.800 → 00:01:44.560] Now let's first of all talk about what a flight controller does. Now normally in let's take an example
[00:01:44.560 → 00:01:50.700] of a radio controlled plane. The way it works is that we have the receiver and then all the servos
[00:01:50.700 → 00:01:56.140] and the speed controller for the motor if it's electric plug into the receiver directly. Now with
[00:01:56.140 → 00:02:00.380] a flight controller that is a little bit of electronics that sits between the receiver
[00:02:00.380 → 00:02:06.060] and everything else on the model and the flight controller is pretty clever. It actually controls
[00:02:06.060 → 00:02:13.080] all of the servos and ESCs and makes the model fly and what it's doing is it's listening to what you
[00:02:13.080 → 00:02:18.160] want the model to do from the signals coming in from the radio receiver so it knows where all your
[00:02:18.160 → 00:02:24.680] throttle, aileron, elevator, rudder and bits and pieces are and then it's feeling through its own
[00:02:24.680 → 00:02:31.280] onboard sensors how the model is moving and then translating that into what needs to happen with
[00:02:31.280 → 00:02:37.080] either the control surfaces or the speed controllers to actually give you what you're asking for on the
[00:02:37.080 → 00:02:43.060] controls. Now simple stabilizers for fixed wing kind of do a mini light version of that but flight
[00:02:43.080 → 00:02:48.660] controllers modern flight controllers in particular are much more capable of doing some pretty
[00:02:48.660 → 00:02:53.780] impressive stuff as well as basic flight stabilization. Some of the most advanced flight
[00:02:53.780 → 00:02:59.820] controllers out there so things that are running iNav flight and things that are running RD pilot
[00:02:59.820 → 00:03:07.280] can be set up to fly completely autonomously so you can upload a mission to it and then it'll just fly
[00:03:07.280 → 00:03:13.640] it all itself and do everything. So there's a broad range of stuff here and again don't worry about the
[00:03:13.640 → 00:03:19.020] jargon too much I'm going to try and keep it to a minimum as we go through the slides. So the flight
[00:03:19.020 → 00:03:24.520] controller itself is a little bit of hardware it looks like a little circuit board normally but if
[00:03:24.520 → 00:03:29.700] you're looking at the latest Pixhawk family it can look like a little black cube stuck on top of a board
[00:03:29.700 → 00:03:37.620] full of connections. Now this is actually a little computer it has a CPU it has memory it has IO ports
[00:03:37.620 → 00:03:43.380] so it is like a little computer that you would use every day to do your email or access the web or
[00:03:43.380 → 00:03:52.700] whatever but this hardware this little PCB board needs some firmware to run on it a program if you want
[00:03:52.700 → 00:03:59.400] to think of it like that that actually does all of the work. So the the flight controller has all of the
[00:03:59.400 → 00:04:04.340] pieces of a computer and you're loading the software on it that software because it kind of lives on the
[00:04:04.340 → 00:04:10.920] board is called firmware and that's what things like iNav, Betaflight, RD pilot are actually that's
[00:04:10.920 → 00:04:16.660] actually the firmware that you have to flash or load onto the flight controller. Very few flight
[00:04:16.660 → 00:04:21.640] controllers come with that stuff already on or if they do it's typically an older version that you need
[00:04:21.640 → 00:04:27.420] to update anyway and that's commonly what I do in my build videos in the very early part I kind of update
[00:04:27.420 → 00:04:33.520] the firmware or the software bit onto the hardware flight controller so that those two bits go together.
[00:04:33.960 → 00:04:40.940] The third part in this trinity is usually a program that goes onto your computer and that program is
[00:04:40.940 → 00:04:47.640] used to flash or upload the firmware onto the hardware flight controller but then is also used to set
[00:04:47.640 → 00:04:53.420] everything up and calibrate things like the radio and other pieces so when with those three things
[00:04:53.420 → 00:04:59.760] together the hardware the firmware that's loaded onto the hardware and the pc application that you
[00:04:59.760 → 00:05:04.840] run on your computer those three things work together to make the flight control system.
[00:05:05.560 → 00:05:11.220] Now there are loads and loads of flight controller options I started out in the very early days on this
[00:05:11.220 → 00:05:16.380] channel with something called multi-Wii which sound rude but it isn't. So things like the multi-Wii,
[00:05:16.380 → 00:05:25.320] APM, CC3D, NAZI32 they were stuff that was in vogue five six years ago you don't want to be using any of
[00:05:25.320 → 00:05:30.320] those don't touch them with a barge pole. These days you want to be looking at flight controllers that
[00:05:30.320 → 00:05:37.440] have a relatively modern CPU so that's an F4 based flight controller and that's what the F4, F7 is
[00:05:37.440 → 00:05:44.300] actually referring to it's how powerful the flight controller CPU is that's actually on the little
[00:05:44.300 → 00:05:51.640] PCB board and with modern flight control firmware it needs more and more processing power in order to
[00:05:51.640 → 00:05:58.040] run so these days an F4 board is kind of the minimum F7 and H7 which is even more powerful
[00:05:58.040 → 00:06:03.540] are becoming the norm so those are the kind of things that you need to look at. With the explosion of the
[00:06:03.540 → 00:06:08.340] multicopter revolution lots and lots of flight controllers these days are built so that you can
[00:06:08.340 → 00:06:15.820] attach the four ESCs on the corners and build a quadcopter and I've used quite a lot of them on the
[00:06:15.820 → 00:06:23.120] channel and some flight controllers need a separate power distribution board or PDB that you connect all
[00:06:23.120 → 00:06:27.900] the power into that's where the battery connects to and the ESCs connect to as well and it maybe
[00:06:27.900 → 00:06:33.140] passes the voltage around and also typically that board then plugs into the flight controller
[00:06:33.140 → 00:06:39.220] and the flight controller then can monitor the voltage and currents that are being used to keep
[00:06:39.220 → 00:06:43.620] track of how much battery is left so that's the other part of the system that you might come across
[00:06:43.620 → 00:06:50.840] but most modern flight controllers these days are what are called all-in-one or AIO boards they have
[00:06:50.840 → 00:06:56.420] that power distribution board they have all the flight controller bits all the pads that you need
[00:06:56.420 → 00:07:03.380] actually on board and some flight controllers are what are called all-in-one or AIO flight controllers
[00:07:03.380 → 00:07:09.580] and they have all the pieces on one little circuit board everywhere where you connect your servos or
[00:07:09.580 → 00:07:15.040] your speed controllers or things like the battery power and the power connections for the ESCs inside
[00:07:15.040 → 00:07:21.780] the model as well all-in-one boards make for really clean simple installations and I'm a big fan of those
[00:07:21.780 → 00:07:25.720] because it means you have one board that does everything rather than two or three boards that
[00:07:25.720 → 00:07:31.640] you have to try and fit inside your model there are different kinds of flight controllers and some
[00:07:31.640 → 00:07:37.720] of them are suited as I've just mentioned to some applications rather than others some of them are
[00:07:37.720 → 00:07:43.380] multi-purpose so if they've got lots of connections for outputs for things like servos and speed controllers
[00:07:43.380 → 00:07:48.560] then they could be used in pretty much anything but you tend to find that they tend to be specialized
[00:07:48.560 → 00:07:55.620] so the all-in-one boards typically tend to be aimed at multi-rotors but some of the matek boards are
[00:07:55.620 → 00:08:02.620] built specifically for wings so do watch the build videos on the channel for the ones that I'm using
[00:08:02.620 → 00:08:06.760] because I'm always trying to use the latest and greatest and use flight controllers that I haven't
[00:08:06.760 → 00:08:12.900] done before to show how they all go together some of the larger flight controllers that are designed for
[00:08:12.900 → 00:08:17.800] more complex installations where you're going to have things like GPS external compasses
[00:08:17.800 → 00:08:24.600] airspeed sensors lidar sonar sensors those kind of things will have lots of what are called UARTs
[00:08:24.600 → 00:08:30.600] I'm going to talk about some of the three and four letter acronyms on a slide in a minute and those are
[00:08:30.600 → 00:08:37.060] just places where you can plug stuff in typically the smaller boards will only have pads or pins for a
[00:08:37.060 → 00:08:44.640] very small number of those kind of UARTs or I squared C ports I squared C is a is another system again we'll talk
[00:08:44.640 → 00:08:50.100] about this in a minute but it's just the way that you connect all these external parts onto it it may
[00:08:50.100 → 00:08:55.200] be for a simple quadcopter you don't need any of that you just need to install the receiver on one
[00:08:55.200 → 00:09:01.820] side and then you can connect the four ESC motor connections on the corner of an all-in-one flight
[00:09:01.820 → 00:09:08.200] controller and you're done but typically you're going to add some FPV stuff and I'll talk about that
[00:09:08.200 → 00:09:14.680] towards the end let me talk a little bit about what flight controllers actually do so we've talked
[00:09:14.680 → 00:09:18.860] about the fact that the flight controller sits in the middle of the radio receiver and all of the
[00:09:18.860 → 00:09:24.960] flight control systems on the plane so speed controllers servos or whatever now the flight
[00:09:24.960 → 00:09:29.520] controller can do almost nothing and typically the way it works is the flight controller does all the
[00:09:29.520 → 00:09:36.540] mixing for you so if you have a V-tail plane or you have a quadcopter you're only sending
[00:09:36.540 → 00:09:42.200] that you want to maybe roll to the right via the radio the flight controller is then figuring out
[00:09:42.200 → 00:09:49.000] which motors need to slow down which ones need to speed up and feeling with its accelerometers and
[00:09:49.000 → 00:09:55.800] gyroscopes on board how that movement is happening and comparing it to how you said you want it happening
[00:09:55.800 → 00:10:00.700] in the software and all that comes together and it kind of does it now there are some common modes that
[00:10:00.700 → 00:10:04.740] you're going to come across when you're talking about flight controllers so let me talk about four of the
[00:10:04.740 → 00:10:12.780] basic ones first one is what's called angle mode now angle mode is like a self-stabilization mode if
[00:10:12.780 → 00:10:18.660] you want to think of it like that it usually has a limit on the pitch and roll of the aircraft so you
[00:10:18.660 → 00:10:24.460] can't turn it over you can't get into too much trouble and with angle mode if you take your hands
[00:10:24.460 → 00:10:30.400] off the sticks it will normally auto level the vehicle whether that's a fixed wing model or it's a
[00:10:30.400 → 00:10:37.500] multi-motor horizon is angle mode with extras so horizon will act like angle mode if you're just
[00:10:37.500 → 00:10:43.180] flying gently but if you push the sticks right to the edge of their travel on your radio then it will
[00:10:43.180 → 00:10:50.220] overcome that limit that you've got of pitch and roll and you're and it will actually then start to
[00:10:50.220 → 00:10:55.440] be able to flip and roll so angle is very much for beginners and for learning to fly I would suggest
[00:10:55.440 → 00:11:02.700] or I still use it sometimes these days for gentle cruising horizon is when you want to start being a
[00:11:02.700 → 00:11:07.540] little bit more aggressive maybe you want to do loops and rolls and flips in the model that you're
[00:11:07.540 → 00:11:13.680] doing next one is sometimes called manual mode or rate mode that's where you don't want any real
[00:11:13.680 → 00:11:19.420] help from the flight controller apart from the mixing that it's doing again you know you're only using one
[00:11:19.420 → 00:11:25.000] stick on the radio but it might be affecting several motors and a multi-rotor in fact it almost certainly
[00:11:25.000 → 00:11:31.960] will be or it will be moving particular controls on the on the fixed wing model and in rate and
[00:11:31.960 → 00:11:39.860] manual mode is doing the absolute basic for you so it's like the very basic stuff that a stabilizer
[00:11:39.860 → 00:11:46.880] would do in a traditional fixed wing model and then finally if you are adding things like a gps and
[00:11:46.880 → 00:11:53.660] using stuff like iNav or iDoPilot then you can do some really cool stuff you can do things like gps loiter
[00:11:53.660 → 00:11:59.420] where you can kind of park the vehicle in the sky with a plane it will just circle around a particular
[00:11:59.420 → 00:12:06.820] point it was at when you initiated gps hold or loiter you can also do gps return to home so in the
[00:12:06.820 → 00:12:13.260] event of a problem or fail safe it'll actually fly back to you and with a multi-rotor with iNav or
[00:12:13.260 → 00:12:20.800] iDoPilot it'll actually then land automatically and disarm itself as well so again you don't have to
[00:12:20.800 → 00:12:26.360] have really complicated systems with lots of things added onto it and plugged in you can be very basic
[00:12:26.360 → 00:12:31.820] the builds that i tend to do i tend to like to show how you add all those extra things and then if you
[00:12:31.820 → 00:12:36.500] wanted to you could and we'll talk a little bit more about the differences between things like
[00:12:36.500 → 00:12:43.280] Betaflight iNav and iDoPilot in a minute so let me cover some more of these three and four letter
[00:12:43.280 → 00:12:51.100] acronyms first one we'll talk about what called uarts these uarts are usually four pads on a flight
[00:12:51.100 → 00:12:55.780] controller these are the plus five volts of ground a transmitter receive typically you're going to plug
[00:12:55.780 → 00:13:02.760] things like gps or telemetry radios into them they are universal so you can have them running at
[00:13:02.760 → 00:13:08.020] different speeds with different protocols they are fantastic so some of the really big modern flight
[00:13:08.020 → 00:13:16.000] controllers have lots of uart ports available and you can plug lots of things into it the next one
[00:13:16.000 → 00:13:23.500] that you'll see me talk about is i squared c or iic it's a bus architecture that you can plug lots of
[00:13:23.500 → 00:13:31.020] different things in now external compasses tend to run on i squared c but other sensors can now you can
[00:13:31.020 → 00:13:37.200] have multiple things connected into one i squared c connection because it's like a little computer network
[00:13:37.200 → 00:13:43.560] with a uart that we've just talked about it tends to be a uart is dedicated for one specific peripheral
[00:13:43.560 → 00:13:49.480] whether that's a telemetry radio or a gps or something else but they're just both of them
[00:13:49.480 → 00:13:54.960] just ways that you can connect other devices to your flight controller and get them to work
[00:13:54.960 → 00:14:00.480] s bus is the most common protocol you're going to come across these days it's the protocol or the way
[00:14:00.480 → 00:14:05.180] that the receiver talks to the flight controller and sends the information about where all the controls
[00:14:05.180 → 00:14:13.880] are on the radio that's in your hand there are lots of other options available there's fpaw i bus crsf
[00:14:13.880 → 00:14:19.840] loads of other different ways that people can use but s bus is probably going to be the most common
[00:14:19.840 → 00:14:25.920] and s bus is really only used in these days to just get the signals from your receiver
[00:14:25.920 → 00:14:32.220] into the flight controller s bus is really good because it's a digital signal and that digital signal
[00:14:32.220 → 00:14:37.880] means you can error check and there's also extra things around all the channel positions so the flight
[00:14:37.880 → 00:14:43.880] controller can see when there's a problem an error or a fail safe condition and take appropriate action
[00:14:43.880 → 00:14:49.300] and that fail safe condition might be return to home fly back to you and land at your feet if you've got
[00:14:49.300 → 00:14:55.500] things like a gps connected so let me talk a little bit now about the different firmwares that you're probably
[00:14:55.500 → 00:15:00.240] going to come across if you watch any of the builds on the series let me talk about the three most common
[00:15:00.240 → 00:15:05.180] ones that you're going to bump into watching stuff on youtube the first one and probably this one's
[00:15:05.180 → 00:15:10.440] got the most video by far and away is going to be beta flight now beta flights been around for a while
[00:15:10.440 → 00:15:16.840] and it tends to be focused on multi-rotor racing so it's really aimed at that it's all about giving
[00:15:16.840 → 00:15:24.800] the most locked in feel and the fastest responses for flying a quadcopter typically very quickly
[00:15:24.800 → 00:15:30.700] it's not very good and lots of things outside of that so it doesn't really care about fixed wing
[00:15:30.700 → 00:15:38.140] it has very limited gps functionality but if you are looking for a quadcopter and you want to fly it
[00:15:38.140 → 00:15:45.620] without lots of extra sensors on it then beta flight with a little all-in-one flight controller is going to
[00:15:45.620 → 00:15:54.240] be a great choice next one is iNav flight commonly referred to as iNav now iNav and beta flight had a common
[00:15:54.240 → 00:16:02.060] ancestor and iNav rather than just focus on the quadcopter side went away to focus initially on
[00:16:02.060 → 00:16:09.900] all the gps flight modes so in iNav if you want gps functionality it has an awful lot of that stuff
[00:16:09.900 → 00:16:15.360] sorted out it's great for loitering return to home it'll even fly autonomous missions you can program
[00:16:15.360 → 00:16:20.080] that upload it into the flight controller and the flight controller will just take off and do its own
[00:16:20.080 → 00:16:28.160] flight it is probably not as polished as beta flight in terms of the high-end performance for
[00:16:28.160 → 00:16:35.360] things like quadcopter racing but it is absolutely great also at fixed wing and i tend to if i'm
[00:16:35.360 → 00:16:42.400] building a fixed wing these days use iNav if if i just want a nice clean simple installation that
[00:16:42.400 → 00:16:48.320] supports all the modern protocols the last one that you'll see on my channel is something called
[00:16:48.320 → 00:16:54.960] ardupilot now ardupilot originally was just for things like the apm hardware and pixfork and the
[00:16:54.960 → 00:17:02.560] ardupilot family consists of things like arducopter ardurover arduplane ardusub so there's lots of
[00:17:02.560 → 00:17:08.640] different versions of it depending on what you want to fly so whereas with beta flight it's really just
[00:17:08.640 → 00:17:16.800] quad well multi rotors with iNav it's fixed wing and multi rotors with ardupilot it is all kinds of
[00:17:16.800 → 00:17:21.440] stuff now iNav at the moment are developing also for things like rovers and other platforms as
[00:17:21.440 → 00:17:29.040] well which is exciting but ardupilot has been doing it for a very long time now in terms of bulletproof
[00:17:29.040 → 00:17:36.160] code ardupilot is right up there and i did a couple of builds last year putting ardupilot onto non-pixfork
[00:17:36.160 → 00:17:41.440] technology because they support third-party boards now things like the omnibus and the matek flight
[00:17:41.440 → 00:17:49.760] controllers and adding things like the uh telemetry radials adding things like the gps using things
[00:17:49.760 → 00:17:57.120] like uarts and i squared c ports have been a fantastic experience for me here i'm a big fan of ardupilot
[00:17:57.120 → 00:18:03.840] but it hasn't got the support for all the modern protocols and isn't as slick on things like fpv
[00:18:03.840 → 00:18:08.400] where you're adding some kind of contextual information over the view from the camera in
[00:18:08.400 → 00:18:14.960] your goggles all that stuff is relatively new and if you want to control your video transmitter using
[00:18:14.960 → 00:18:21.600] smartport or tramp or you want to support lots of the new technologies like crsf which is a low latency
[00:18:21.600 → 00:18:28.720] connection that team black sheep developed the other two support that stuff ardupilot doesn't yet
[00:18:29.280 → 00:18:33.040] if you're interested in knowing more about that hopefully that gives you a bit of context and you
[00:18:33.040 → 00:18:38.400] can go and watch the series on the channel go and have a look in the playlist and there's lots and
[00:18:38.400 → 00:18:44.080] lots of builds using all this technology to show you the differences last thing i'll talk about which
[00:18:44.080 → 00:18:51.280] i've touched on a little bit is fpv now fpv is where you are going to fly by looking out live through a
[00:18:51.280 → 00:18:58.080] little camera mounted at the front of the model now in planes or multi rotors you can just have the
[00:18:58.080 → 00:19:02.560] camera connected to a video transmitter that sends the signal to your goggles and you can watch it and
[00:19:02.560 → 00:19:08.720] fly it first person view which is fpv stands for most modern flight controllers though are smarter than
[00:19:08.720 → 00:19:16.240] that you connect the video from the camera into the flight controller and then you connect a video out
[00:19:16.240 → 00:19:22.160] from the flight controller into the video transmitter that then sends it to the goggles and what the
[00:19:22.160 → 00:19:28.000] flight controller does very cleverly is overlays key flight information so flight time battery voltage
[00:19:28.000 → 00:19:34.240] distance from home if you have things like gps ground speed all the the flight mode that you're in
[00:19:34.240 → 00:19:40.320] all that goodness can be popped around the outside of the image and it's great for keeping an eye on how
[00:19:40.320 → 00:19:47.200] much time you've got left or whereabouts you are related to way to cough some flight controllers are more
[00:19:47.200 → 00:19:52.400] advanced with this than others so one of the flight controllers that i really like for example is the
[00:19:52.400 → 00:19:58.720] brain fpv flight controller that has a graphical on-screen display but flight controllers from
[00:19:58.720 → 00:20:05.360] people like matek holibro all those guys actually have an on-screen display and again it's the on-screen
[00:20:05.360 → 00:20:12.400] display supported by all three of the firmwares i've just talked about that's inav beta flight and
[00:20:12.400 → 00:20:18.480] ardupilot as well couple last things to think about the dji air unit doesn't work in exactly that way it
[00:20:18.480 → 00:20:24.240] works slightly differently at the moment the only support is really for beta flight for the dji air
[00:20:24.240 → 00:20:29.280] unit i'll link to the video that talks about that and the last point in this video is there are some
[00:20:29.280 → 00:20:34.000] flight controllers that have been around for a long time things like the pixhawk family don't have in
[00:20:34.000 → 00:20:40.720] built support for an on-screen display for fpv so unfortunately if you want that kind of stuff with fpv you
[00:20:40.720 → 00:20:47.120] have to use additional boards again see my builds with pixhawk where i show you how to do that
[00:20:47.120 → 00:20:52.400] so i'm going to stop there hopefully that's enough information for those of you new pilots who are
[00:20:52.400 → 00:20:56.720] interested in flight controllers but we're just getting lost in the build series and enough context
[00:20:56.720 → 00:21:01.360] so that you can go and watch them and it will make more sense a flight controller is just a little
[00:21:01.360 → 00:21:08.240] computer running some firmware on there that is then doing a lot of the flying for you how much of that
[00:21:08.240 → 00:21:15.440] you can decide by flicking a switch on your radio that selects the flight mode it can be very basic
[00:21:15.440 → 00:21:21.840] and just do the essentially what a stabilizer would do if you use that in a fixed wing or it can be
[00:21:21.840 → 00:21:27.840] super duper complex with gps airspeed sensors lidar and all those kind of other things and fly
[00:21:27.840 → 00:21:33.840] everything autonomously and you can get stuff that will do everything in between so if you have any
[00:21:33.840 → 00:21:39.040] questions or comments please pop them down below and i'll put links down below to some of my most recent
[00:21:39.040 → 00:21:44.160] build series so now hopefully armed with that understanding you can watch them and they'll make more sense
[00:21:45.440 → 00:21:50.960] thank you for watching my video and watching right to the very end if you want to find out what i'm
