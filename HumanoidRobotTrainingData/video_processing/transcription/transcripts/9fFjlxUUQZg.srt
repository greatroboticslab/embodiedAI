00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Construction of a Zobel Network.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Zobel Network is a filter class, which takes care of for fixing the transfer impedance.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Initially this was used in telecommunications, and has multiple configurations, for a great variety of uses.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
On the amplifier's subject, this helps to protect the speaker output.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The Zobel Network consists of four components, like this.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
One resistor and one capacitor in series between themselves, that to his time are in parallel, with respect to the speaker of the amplifier.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Then see a coil and a resistance in parallel, that is found in series with the speaker output.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Zobel Network or oscillation, lock has several functions.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In first place, is used for that the amplifier, see to it output a load resistive, instead of the load inductive, that presents the speaker.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
In second place, avoids the step of current inverse, generated by the speaker, that can get to damage the amplifier outputs.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And finally, without being less important, helps to reduce the possibility, of oscillations of high frequency, that can get to reheat the amplifier.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then we will see how to build a network of Zobel, serving to many amplifiers.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Materials

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Printed circuit board, you can be made in fiberglass or bakelite.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In the video description, you can download the PDF file.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
2 resistors, of 10 ohms, to 5 watts.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
4 resistors, of 22 ohms, to 1 watt.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
2 capacitors, of 0.1 microfarad, to 250 volts.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And insulated copper wire, 16 AWG gauge.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Assembly

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We will begin by making the coils.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We take wire enameled copper, and around a half inch drill bit.

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We roll up 12 turns.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They must be well aligned, and without spaces between a turn and another turn.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We cut the excess wire.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The coil should be as perfect as possible.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, we must as the coil will be welded at the PCB, remove dielectric varnish of their terminals,

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
so that later the solder to stick.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
For this we use coarse grid sandpaper, in this case, grain 80.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We must be careful not to mistreat the coil, not to deform it, and also not to scrape the spirals enamel.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This work is done with great care.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We make 2 equal coils.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The resistor of 10 ohms to 5 watts, must enter perfectly inside of the coil.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Then fold our terminals downward.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We insert the set, formed by the coil, and the resistance, in the PCB.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We put the other set.

40
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We put the other set.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Now place the 22 ohm resistors in their respective place.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Remember that as the resistors are connected in parallel, they become a single resistor, of 11 ohms to 2 watts.

43
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And we put the 0.1 microfarad capacitor, in its respective place.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We place the other 2 resistors of 22 ohms, to 1 watt.

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And finally, we place the 0.1 microfarads capacitor.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Remember to use as a guide, the component mask, delivered in the PDF file.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We proceed to weld all the components.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Remember that the correct way to weld, is done, joining welding, soldering iron and parts to be welded at the same time.

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We cut off the surplus of the component terminals.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
With the aid of a nail clipper or a wire cutter, we cut off the surplus of the component terminals.

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Now, place the 6 pin terminals molex type, to which we have previously removed the pin in between, and in the opposite direction, so that when installing the circuit, it can only be connected in one direction.

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Finally, we weld the terminals with the PCB.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The welding should be plentiful, and perfectly surround each pin.

54
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We have ready our Zobel network, which we can use with a great variety of amplifiers.

55
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Success!
