Inspiring work

It is so sad that people misuse money on "neural" network to reproduce behaviors that robots were capable of 30 years ago. Just take as an example our best inspiration the human being. For instance, people can perform the same task in a completely dark room ...

Very good work. Very inspiring.

What about to train the robots in a virtual simulation to save energy consumption and money though?

Nice to know you.

very good work to solve real-world robot learning problems.

Recommendable

Money is so important for AI research!

In short time so many videos but this is most interesting topic 🌹😂😊😎

Excellent speaker. Looking forward to hearing from him in the future.

cool that's insightful i want to study machine learning but i have problem in setting up environment on windows 10

what does this have to do with the presentation

Briliant Nyoni use linux

Saeed Bin Hamad  Hi Saeed thanks let me save up and buy a new desktop thank you

Briliant Nyoni leave Windows.. get a Linux distribution like Ubuntu 16.04.

Carlos Segura  Thanks i will do that immediately

It's really not that bad getting stuff set up on windows... But I guess it's so easy to spin up a VM it's a fair point

Depending on his current Windows pc, a virtual machine could work fine.  I use both Ubuntu and Windows. On Windows, I just install 'Git bash'.  That way I have access to most (if not all) of the bash shell commands that  I commonly use on Ubuntu. If you use python,  you could also use anaconda (never used it myself, by I heard that it makes things easier with dependencies and stuff).

On windows 10 there something named Windows Subsystem for Linux, I really like this feature and I suggest to try it.

You can install conda environment from anaconda repo.  It will be a good start.
