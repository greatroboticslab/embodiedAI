00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Subideorockola

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Tone and volume control plus independent microphone pre-amplifier

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Next we teach to build a circuit, which very well complements your stereo amplifier, improving sound and performance.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A great advantage of this circuit, is that we can place the volume control, up to 30 meters away from the amplifier, without any noise being introduced.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This makes it ideal for video jukebox, making it easier to control them. Also, the microphone input, allows to convert your video jukebox, into a karaoke.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Materials

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The materials for this project are pretty economical and easy to get.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In the description of the video, you will find the link to the article, in which you can download a PDF file, with the PCB, electric diagram, bill of materials, and everything necessary to carry out this project.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Construction

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We will begin by placing all the resistors.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The resistor terminals, are banned with the help of a tweezers.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
They must remain straight, and of the same length.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then, the resistor is introduced into its corresponding place, taking care that it reaches the bottom, and is perfectly placed.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
With this same technique, we must place all other resistors.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Remember to use the component mask as a guide.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:13,000
After verifying that all the resistors are in their correct place, they are well.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Remember that the correct welding technique is done by joining, soldering iron, weld, and piece to be welded, at the same time.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The welds should be round, and perfectly surround each terminal.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Now we must cut all the leftovers of the resistor terminals.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
For this we can use a nail clipper.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Leftovers are collected, as they will be recycled.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
These wires are stored, then used as jumpers.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It is measured over the card, the length of the bridge to be made.

25
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Is bent one end of the wire.

26
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is measured again.

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And bend the other end, at the exact distance, so that the jumper enters the holes in the cart.

28
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The jumper is placed in its respective place.

29
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In the same way, we build and place the other jumpers, which go in the printed circuit board.

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We proceed to weld all the jumpers.

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The excess are cut.

32
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The excess are cut.

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We weld two missing points for soldering.

34
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And we cut.

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We already have correctly placed all the resistors and jumpers.

36
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,540
The polyester and ceramic capacitors have no polarity.

37
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:02,680
We place the capacitors in their respective places.

38
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,800
We place the polyester capacitors that are responsible for setting the frequencies, which

39
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,560
operates the tone control.

40
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,460
Doing this work, we realized that we were missing one of the jumpers.

41
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,740
We will place it later.

42
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,840
We weld the capacitors.

43
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,360
Now, place the 8-pin socket in the correct position.

44
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:37,320
And weld it to the PCB.

45
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,700
Then place the 16-pin socket.

46
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:48,140
Check the position in the component mask.

47
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:56,000
And weld the socket.

48
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,380
The electrolytic capacitors do have polarity.

49
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:04,180
Check at the time of placing them, that the strip that determines the negative pole, match

50
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:11,180
the drawing, in the component mask.

51
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:25,180
And weld the capacitors.

52
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:36,860
Now place the LM7812 regulator.

53
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,500
See close attention to polarity.

54
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:47,000
Place the molex connector of the signal input.

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,900
And the signal output connector, which will go to the amplifier.

56
00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:05,320
To the power connector, is remove the middle pin.

57
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:13,280
And put it in place.

58
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,300
We place the diode bridge, leaving it slightly raised from the PCB.

59
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,420
See close attention to polarity.

60
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:25,560
Place the potentiometer that controls the microphone volume.

61
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,820
The microphone jack.

62
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:32,280
The jack for remote volume control.

63
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,260
The volume potentiometer.

64
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,760
The potentiometer that controls the high frequencies.

65
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,700
The potentiometer that controls the low frequencies.

66
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:50,560
And the power indicator LED.

67
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,920
Now insert the 741 integrated circuit.

68
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,740
Check the position on the component mask.

69
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:06,600
In the same way, place the TA7630 integrated circuit.

70
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:14,740
We already have our tone and volume control, with independent microphone preamplifier.

71
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,500
Using a toothbrush and thinner, we proceed to wash the PCB very well, on the tracks side.

72
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:29,680
The idea is to remove grease and all metal particles and solder, which can generate short circuits.

73
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,680
With a piece of toilet paper, it dries very well the PCB.

74
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,680
And finish cleaning with a dry brush.

75
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,680
The PCB should be clean and shiny.

76
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,860
Measurements.

77
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,480
With the multimeter on the continuity scale, the AC power input is measured.

78
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,040
There should be no impedance or continuity.

79
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:08,660
Now, we feed the circuit with a transformer between 12 and 15 volts AC, and a minimum of 300 milliampperes.

80
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:17,660
Always, the first time the preamplifier is turned on, the series circuit should be used, with a bulb of between 5 and 1 0 W.

81
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,280
And then, connect to the public network.

82
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,280
And if everything is correct, the LED turn on.

83
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,840
Measure the voltage already rectified by the diode bridge and the 1000 microfarad capacitor.

84
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,280
There should be approximately 18 volts DC.

85
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,900
Now place the black tip on the bridge negative pole, and the red tip, on the pin 1 of the regulator.

86
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,900
There should be the same 18 volts DC.

87
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:55,520
Then, measure the regulator output, and there should be 12 volts approximately.

88
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:03,520
To measure the voltage entering the 741 IC, place the black tip on pin 3, and the red tip on pin 7.

89
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:10,520
Should measure 6 volts, which is half the regulator voltage.

90
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:17,460
Now, with the black tip on pin 3, and the red tip on pin 4, is measured minus 6 volts DC.

91
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,700
The voltage must be symmetrical.

92
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:30,960
You can also check the total voltage, on the jumper marked with 12 volts.

93
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,320
Connections.

94
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,520
For signal input, we constructed a cable with a double female RCA connector, one piece of

95
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:46,580
shielded stereo cable, and a 2.54 mm 3 pin molex female connector.

96
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,840
The signal output cable, has in the same connector of 3 pins, 3 wires, left signal, ground, and

97
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,300
right signal.

98
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,800
And it connects to the amplifier, bifurcated, in independent connectors, to send each signal to

99
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,000
each mono stage of the amplifier, thus keeping the stereo sound.

100
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,200
Our tone control with microphone preamplifier is ready to be used.

101
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,400
In the following videos, you can see how to do remote volume control for this project.

102
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:30,600
And a 400 watts stereo amplifier, with which the sound test was performed.

103
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,460
Now listen to the live sound test.

104
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,800
¿Qué tal amigos?

105
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,640
Now listen to the sound of our control of tones

106
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,240
control by tension

107
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,120
with the additional microphone input.

108
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,760
We will amplify it

109
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,320
with our 400W stereo amplifier.

110
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,680
Listen to it.

111
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
The volume.

112
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Now let's see the bass.

113
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,720
Now İndia's bass.

114
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,920
Notice that small tune.

115
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:27,400
And the score of both the bass.

116
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:36,880
And now listen to audio

117
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,020
quickly at insert recordings

118
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,240
Hi there is the microphone

119
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:50,060
It is interesting that you can dab the sound

120
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,380
with the music

121
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:04,400
We hope this project is of the best of all.

122
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
