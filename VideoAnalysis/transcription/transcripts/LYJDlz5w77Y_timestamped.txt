[00:00:00.160 → 00:00:06.480] hello and welcome to the channel once again and in today's video we are going to have a look at the
[00:00:06.480 → 00:00:13.200] functions of the flysky fsi 6x transmitter that what is in there and what is it for so let's move
[00:00:13.200 → 00:00:21.520] into it so here on our transmitter we have got six to ten channels if you don't watch the introductory
[00:00:21.520 → 00:00:30.240] video please just click up in there on the i button so if we want to turn on the transmitter just simply
[00:00:30.240 → 00:00:37.840] turn on the power button and here we have got our home screen uh this is this indicates our battery
[00:00:37.840 → 00:00:43.920] this is our fly sky the model which we are using right now the name of the model and this is the
[00:00:43.920 → 00:00:51.760] number of the model and here the protocol of the transmitter is work is mentioned that upon which
[00:00:51.760 → 00:00:59.040] protocol is it working right now here we have got the voltage of the transmitter the that is 4.67
[00:00:59.040 → 00:01:07.600] volts right now and down below when we connect it to our uh our receiver so here we get the voltage of
[00:01:07.600 → 00:01:17.440] our receiver and the signal strength so if you want to enter the uh setup menu so just press and hold
[00:01:17.440 → 00:01:29.280] ok for two seconds and here we enter to our menu setup so uh here are four buttons two are for the up and
[00:01:29.280 → 00:01:37.360] down and here we have got a cancel button so if you want to quit uh uh settings so we just press the
[00:01:37.360 → 00:01:45.680] cancel button and ok button is to enter uh settings and to save a setting we just simply have to press
[00:01:45.680 → 00:01:53.600] and hold the cancel button for example if i just enter into the system and i just want to select a model
[00:01:54.240 → 00:02:01.520] i want it on model 6 and i want to save it so i am just going to have press and hold the cancel button
[00:02:01.520 → 00:02:10.400] and it is saved uh now just i just want to counter check it so press ok button it entered into it and
[00:02:10.400 → 00:02:18.560] it is now on model 6 and it is saved and if i want i don't want to save anything i just want to quit the
[00:02:18.560 → 00:02:25.360] same settings as it was before so if now if i change it on model 5 and i don't want to save it
[00:02:25.360 → 00:02:34.080] i'm just going to press the cancel button once and i'm the settings will be just quit now i check it so
[00:02:34.080 → 00:02:43.200] it was saved on model 6. so now here we have got uh two kind of setups that one is the system settings
[00:02:43.200 → 00:02:49.760] and one is the setup so in the system settings we basically have got the model settings that which
[00:02:49.760 → 00:02:58.640] model you want to copy a model and the receiver setups and that is actually mostly related to the
[00:02:58.640 → 00:03:04.640] use of your transmitter the basics use and in the function and in the setup menu the functions of
[00:03:04.640 → 00:03:10.640] the transmitter are concerned that how much will be the sensitivity which switch to use for uh which
[00:03:10.640 → 00:03:17.600] function so now let's start from the system settings and in the system settings the first one is the
[00:03:17.600 → 00:03:24.400] model setup the model select so in the model select we just have to select our model here are i think
[00:03:24.400 → 00:03:33.600] so 20 models that you can have for different kind of uh airplanes or quadcopters you want so you can
[00:03:33.600 → 00:03:41.120] select each for one i don't think so one would use all these 20 in the second one there is a model name
[00:03:41.120 → 00:03:52.160] so if you want to name a specific model uh for a plane you want so you can do it in here for example in
[00:03:52.160 → 00:04:02.640] the model uh for model 6 i just wanted to fly sky here here as i change it in here so with the down
[00:04:02.640 → 00:04:10.400] button the name also changes in there and if i press ok so it changes shifts to another alphabet and if i change
[00:04:10.400 → 00:04:18.960] one of the way as t or s so here it is and if i want to save it so press and hold cancel and here we
[00:04:18.960 → 00:04:29.920] have got saved the um the alphabet with which we enter in there and the next one is a model name model type
[00:04:29.920 → 00:04:38.080] that for which purpose you are using that specific model for an airplane for a helicopter or there are
[00:04:38.080 → 00:04:47.760] many more setups i don't even use those i'm just using the airplane which works for a quadcopter and our
[00:04:47.760 → 00:04:55.840] airplane model too the next one is a model copy so if you want the settings of one model into another
[00:04:55.840 → 00:05:05.040] so you just use the settings uh if you just set model 5 for example for an airplane and if you are
[00:05:05.040 → 00:05:11.840] making another airplane and you want the settings of model 5 to be there in model 6 so you just use
[00:05:11.840 → 00:05:18.560] this function the next one is the model reset if you want to reset a model for example i want to reset
[00:05:18.560 → 00:05:27.840] the model 6 which i which i just renamed right now so i press ok and it asks for uh permission i'm going to
[00:05:27.840 → 00:05:35.040] press yes and press ok button and the model will be reset now if i enter into it so the name is again reset
[00:05:35.040 → 00:05:44.320] to its default uh name the next one is the rx setup that is actually related to your receiver setup that
[00:05:44.320 → 00:05:53.600] what your receiver uh setups will be so the first one is the rf standard which means that on which protocol you want your
[00:05:53.600 → 00:06:03.440] receiver to work for example i'm just using this receiver the flysky fsia6b which works on the protocol
[00:06:03.440 → 00:06:13.840] of the afhds2a you also have some receivers which are working on the protocol of afhds for example i have
[00:06:13.840 → 00:06:23.280] got this receiver uh which works on the protocol of afhds so uh here we have to mention that which
[00:06:23.280 → 00:06:34.160] protocol you want to use the next one is the rx battery that uh on which voltage you want an alarm
[00:06:34.800 → 00:06:42.000] and on which you want a high setup so uh you just set it from here you also have the option to select
[00:06:42.000 → 00:06:48.880] an external sensor which is i think attached in here i don't know i never used it the next one is the
[00:06:48.880 → 00:06:57.520] failsafe in the failsafe in the failsafe you just uh tell your receiver that what to do upon failsafe if
[00:06:57.520 → 00:07:05.840] it disconnects from your transmitter so for example i just want channel 3 to be set up on a failsafe i
[00:07:06.480 → 00:07:17.120] first uh enter into channel 3 i put uh i just press the uh up button to turn it on and the position i want
[00:07:17.120 → 00:07:24.960] channel 3 to be upon failsafe that for example i want channel 3 my throttle to be on 50 percent upon the
[00:07:24.960 → 00:07:35.040] failsafe so i put my throttle on 50 percent and press and hold the cancel button so now it is on zero which
[00:07:35.040 → 00:07:46.720] means that uh my here my throttle is minus 50 percent here is zero and here it will be uh 100 so that is
[00:07:46.720 → 00:07:57.120] upon zero in the middle and uh my throttle will be on zero or if i just uh get a feel safe some somewhere
[00:07:58.000 → 00:08:03.600] the next one is the sensor list in which we get a list of the sensors that which sensors are there and
[00:08:04.560 → 00:08:13.520] for example right now we just have a sensor which tells us the internal voltage of our transmitter we also
[00:08:13.520 → 00:08:23.120] have the receiver uh voltage when it is connected to the esc so uh you have the option to connect some
[00:08:23.120 → 00:08:31.280] other sensors so you will just get it here listed the next one is two sensors you can have three sensors
[00:08:31.280 → 00:08:40.480] connected to it i think somehow some sometimes you need uh altitude sensor or i never use that so i don't
[00:08:40.480 → 00:08:47.200] know too much about this but it is actually for the sensors use the next one is the speed distance that
[00:08:47.200 → 00:08:54.000] you want to use a speed sensor a rotation length or there are some kind of auto meter device which are
[00:08:54.000 → 00:09:00.480] used for the measurement of the speed so if you have connected that one to it so you'll get a data of that one in here
[00:09:02.000 → 00:09:10.000] you can just select and set up from here the next one is the esl pressure which means above sea level pressure
[00:09:10.000 → 00:09:20.560] that is actually used for an altitude sensor you just have to calibrate the pressure uh that upon which
[00:09:20.560 → 00:09:29.200] the zero position of the altitude sensor must be so here you put the value in and that works according to
[00:09:29.200 → 00:09:36.640] this the next one is the output mode that upon which more you want your receiver to work that is actually
[00:09:36.640 → 00:09:45.840] too much important because sometimes you use a ppm input sometimes you use a pwm output of this receiver
[00:09:45.840 → 00:09:54.160] sometimes you use it in ibis or espus so you just set it in here so the next one is our ibis setup that
[00:09:54.800 → 00:10:06.560] our ibis setup which will be on which of the uh receive receiver port on here so we just set it on here
[00:10:06.560 → 00:10:13.760] the next one is the server frequency that how much times you want the server to get input each second
[00:10:13.760 → 00:10:20.880] actually frequency means that so uh you want to calibrate or set this value according to your
[00:10:20.880 → 00:10:30.320] server manufacturers give you or you can just put it on 50. uh i never got a problem um regarding this setup
[00:10:30.320 → 00:10:38.320] so that was that was all about the setup menu and now we will move to the function setup so in the
[00:10:38.320 → 00:10:45.280] function setup the first one is the reverse reverse means to reverse a channel the the movement of the
[00:10:45.280 → 00:10:56.480] channel uh for example i want this stick to uh to pitch down when i move it downwards so uh and and it
[00:10:56.480 → 00:11:04.560] moves upwards so i just reversed the channel on which this stick is this stick is i think so on channel
[00:11:04.560 → 00:11:11.760] three no no channel four so i don't actually remember that but you just have to reverse that channel
[00:11:11.760 → 00:11:19.520] that specific channel which you want to to move on the opposite side so the next next one is the display
[00:11:19.520 → 00:11:24.960] settings i want the display to tell you first and then i'll come to the end points so in the display
[00:11:24.960 → 00:11:32.560] settings you get a display of your moments for example i am moving the aileron here we have got moment of
[00:11:32.560 → 00:11:39.040] channel one here we have got the channel three movement which is a throttle so always when you move
[00:11:39.040 → 00:11:48.160] something you have got a display of that in the display menu so when we move to the end points in the
[00:11:48.160 → 00:11:55.840] end points you actually have got the limit of your moment of a specific channel for example i've got my
[00:11:57.360 → 00:12:04.640] aileron on channel one and i want its throw to be more the throw is actually the moment the area of the
[00:12:04.640 → 00:12:13.920] moment of your control surface so i want the aileron to move more so i will increase it up to 120 that is the
[00:12:13.920 → 00:12:24.480] highest limit so in the display actually your uh upon your full moment of your stick it moves up up
[00:12:24.480 → 00:12:33.280] up till this line but when i want i set it on uh limit up till the 120 then upon the full stick it goes to
[00:12:33.280 → 00:12:42.000] here up till the end so that is the most like on this side it was 100 so it will move up till this line
[00:12:42.000 → 00:12:50.000] and the side which was moved to 120 it moves up till the extreme position so that is actually that is
[00:12:50.000 → 00:12:55.920] actually the end point the next one is the aux channels that which are which channel which switch
[00:12:55.920 → 00:13:04.320] you want on which channel for example for channel 5 i want the uh switch a to be working switch a that is
[00:13:04.320 → 00:13:10.720] actually mentioned here so i'll just change it to switch a and i'll press and hold cancel button the next
[00:13:10.720 → 00:13:19.520] one is the subtrim subtrim is actually the settings of your uh control setting that is actually the tuning
[00:13:19.520 → 00:13:29.440] of your aircraft for example your rudder or your specific control surface is not aligned so you can just
[00:13:29.440 → 00:13:40.480] align it here on the sub trim settings that your control sticks will be moved without uh holding your
[00:13:40.480 → 00:13:48.160] control sticks so it is that kind of setup the do the next one is the dual rate and exponential settings
[00:13:48.160 → 00:13:55.360] which is actually the the the sensitivity of your controls i'm going to explain it in detail in a
[00:13:55.360 → 00:14:01.280] later video the next one is a throttle curve it actually means that how much your throttle increase
[00:14:01.280 → 00:14:10.080] upon this movement like for example you want your throttle to be less uh increasing from 0 to 25
[00:14:10.080 → 00:14:16.880] so you actually increase decrease the value of 25 and the graph will change so it will move
[00:14:17.760 → 00:14:27.280] from here to 0.1 your throttle will be increasing less and then your throttle will have more ratio of increase
[00:14:28.240 → 00:14:32.560] the next one is the mixer setup and mixer setup you actually make one channel the
[00:14:32.560 → 00:14:42.080] the master and any other the slave and if you want for example there is a phenomenon called uh adverse heel
[00:14:42.080 → 00:14:52.800] and you want uh your rudder to move automatically upon rolling so you just set the master channel one which is
[00:14:52.800 → 00:15:01.040] your aileron and the slave as channel two which is your channel four which is your rudder so that will move
[00:15:01.040 → 00:15:09.120] accordingly the next one is the le one if you want an le one setup of an aircraft you just get it from here the next one is the
[00:15:09.120 → 00:15:18.800] retail which is also a an aircraft setup so if you want an aircraft to be set up as a a retail aircraft so you set up at
[00:15:18.800 → 00:15:28.800] set it set it up from here the next option is the assigned switches which means that which switch to assign for which purpose for example i want
[00:15:28.800 → 00:15:38.080] switch a to be functioning as a throttle hold switch so i select switch a here and i press and hold cancel
[00:15:38.640 → 00:15:48.320] and when i see here so upon switch a i turn in off the throttle hold function so the next one is a throttle hold and in throttle hold actually we have a
[00:15:48.880 → 00:15:55.360] a functionality or a control over our throttle that if we activate it so our throttle will be
[00:15:55.360 → 00:16:03.600] at the specific position we want for example upon activation of the throttle hold uh function i want
[00:16:03.600 → 00:16:14.240] my throttle to be at 50 percent or at 60 percent so i want i will set it x at 60 percent and i'll press and
[00:16:14.240 → 00:16:22.320] hold cancel button to save it so now if i go to the display settings and i want to see its functionality so upon
[00:16:22.320 → 00:16:28.080] activating the throttles which for example my throttle is at zero right now and if i activate it so my
[00:16:28.080 → 00:16:35.520] throttle would actually automatically move to 60 percent even if i move at my throttle right now it will not
[00:16:37.360 → 00:16:45.840] move from its its location which we set in the settings that is 60 percent and if i just deactivate it
[00:16:45.840 → 00:16:53.920] so even we can move that again okay so that was all about the flysky fsi 6x transmitter functions if you
[00:16:53.920 → 00:16:59.440] like the video please like share and subscribe to the channel and if i miss something please tell me
[00:16:59.440 → 00:17:01.760] down in the comments thank you and see you
