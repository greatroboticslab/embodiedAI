Your code NOT working! Please fix it

Hello, I really appreciate your tutorials, they helped me a lot. I have one problem, I'm faced with the fact that it gives out little fps. I read articles that say it depends on the system, but I have a 3060, i5 10400f and 16 ram. Is this really not enough? If not, what else could be the problem?

Hi there  If I want to make a 3d model to float over a picture what should I do

in which videos do you write the hand tracking module?

Please tell me which coding application sir was using. Please.

can someone pls reply to this comment with the link  of the video where he teaches the fingers up nd down method

can you help me i cant install autopy

Attribute error... HandDetector is not an attribute of handtrackingmodule..

That is a shit project. Your code doesn't work at all

To prevent the error when your finger exits the rectangle, add the following code just above autopy.mouse.move  x3_flip = min(screen_width - x3, screen_width - 0.01) y3 = min(y3, screen_height - 0.01)  and replace autopy.mouse.move(screen_width - x3, y3) with autopy.mouse.move(x3_flip, y3)

God tussi great ho, thank you dear.

Please help sir Which python version will support both mediapipe and autopy

if u r unable to install autopy degrade the version of mediapupe to 0.8.8 and python to 3.7 it will work check it out

portbuf of 3.20.1 version

works perfect mine is Mac too initially I faced many issues but tried solving one by one by copy pasting errors in google and solving accordingly , now this perfect works fine in my Mac book

Hello Bro... Please Help Me I Got Some Error

exactly 3.7 or above 3.7?

@DosawadaAdithya  exactly 3.7

There is no 0.8.10 in mediapipe it shows only 0.8.11  What can I do?

Can you please share your code?

Plss tell me bro

How will i corecct my  No module named'autopy' error bro ?

why is detector = handDetector() giving an error?

For anyone trying to do this project now, don't. The current code that he's using is outdated and does not work with the new framework of mediapipe, even if you roll back your interpreter to an older one, such as in this video it still won't work so you are wasting your time here. I spent 2h trying to figure out why the code doesn't work just to find a bunch of one year old messages on Stack Overflow that this way of writing code is outdated and is no longer supported or valid.

I wrapped code in fingersUp  if len(self.lmList):       ...... else:      fingers=[0,0,0,0,0]  Or just place code #3-10 in main file under `if len(lmList) != 0:`

Hello Cannot install autopy now....says error while installing Please help me out. Thanks

I don’t get a setting option

When I launch python it looks different from this

For those getting "indexerror: list index out of range" when your hand is off camera. Try adding a Try:   Except: to the if statements in the fingersup function and put fingers.append(0) in the except

I hope you would get in future billions of subscribers.

Its really amazing but its painful

Its good, but if we move hand everyday like this it will more pain full then keyboard and mouse

autopy error how to fix that , i cant install autopy

can we add more functionalities to this project like adding the right and left clicks of mouse , scrolling , etc ... can u give some ideas for that ????

Here are some fixes for common errors:  1. Can't install autopy: Update python OR Instead install pyautogui and change the following in AIVirtualMouseProject: autopy.screen.size() to pyautogui.size() autopy.mouse.move to pyautogui.moveTo pyauto.mouse.click() to pyautogui.leftClick()  2. cv2.cvtColor error: change VideoCapture(1) to VideoCapture(0) or to where your webcam input actually is. Both in HandTrackingModule and AiVirtualMouseProject.  3. Out of Bounds error in "self.lmList" and error in "fingers.detector.fingersUp()" In HandTrackingModule before line 73: check if lmList is actually filled with values by adding "if self.lmList:" before everything. Don't forget the indents, but leave return as is. In AiVirtualMouseProject: after "fingers = detector.fingersUp()" make a two-liner with "if not fingers: continue" so it will try to find your hand again and again, but doesn't return an error if your hand leaves the screen, is moved too fast, or simply not recognized.  Hope that helps!

@Chronicsco  I already completed my project, thanks!

@mdhuzaifapatel  congrats brother

Which version of python you have used to complete your project. Please help me. I am unable to install Mediapipe on my pc with python 3.7.9.

@bivasmajumdar7612   I don't remember, but mostly it was 3.7.9 What error are you facing?

The same error occurred to me but don't worry You may be using Python 2.9 or above version but autopy supports till Python 3.8 version you can see on the pypi website. I resolved the issue by downloading version 3.7.9  Hey, don't worry about older versions you can install both the versions on your pc to use them just switch the path of your compiler. You can follow tutorials to install older versions. Best of LUCK.

Thank you so much for your sharing. I have a question relating to installing autopy. How could you solved the problem with error when installing autopy as your first tried. Thank you so much in advance

can we make a virtual keyboard sir?

Thanks Murtaza

i cant install autopy extension :(

How did you install autopy? It gives me the same error you recieved the first time, but it's not going to be fixed just by clicking another time. I've searched both stack and github for a solution, but apparently nobody knows how to fix this.

Sir I am getting this error -  Traceback (most recent call last):   File "H:/Pyhton Projects/OpenCv/main.py", line 36, in <module>     fingers = detector.fingersUp()   File "H:\Pyhton Projects\OpenCv\HandTrackingModules.py", line 65, in fingersUp     if self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]][1] > self.lmList[self.tipIds[0] - 1][1]: IndexError: list index out of range    Please help!

I got an error. Can somebody help me? AttributeError: module 'HandTrackingModule' has no attribute 'handDetector'

HandTrackingModule.py", line 73, in fingersUp     print(self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]][1]) IndexError: list index out of range  Why does this error occurred every time?

I can't install autopy in python 3.9 please help

It shows me some kind of errors

I'm unable to install mediapipe package.... Can somebody help me to install this  package

I have signed up on your site, and was following this AI Virtual Mouse. however, i'm not being able to install "autopy", it's keep giving error. tried to follow instruction from autopy site, but no luck. can u advise any workaround please. thanks in advance

I have difficulty to install AutoPy, it tells: import AutoPy.bitmap when I install it, I use a MacOS Catalina, I need your help cause I like control gestures.

AttributeError: module 'HandTrackingModule' has no attribute 'handDetector' plz help me

I am getting AttributeError module HandTrackingModule has no attribute handDetector(maxHands=1)    Pls help....

It's better that you use a different module like pyautogui or pynput

@krishnaagarwal895  Thank you so much!!!

i am also having problem installing auto py

The same error occurred to me but don't worry You may be using Python 2.9 or above version but autopy supports till Python 3.8 version you can see on the pypi website. I resolved the issue by downloading version 3.7.9  Hey, don't worry about older versions you can install both the versions on your pc to use them just switch the path of your compiler.

I got the same error bro. But he says there're a lot of module, and he use the "Autopy". Finally I Looked for the other module, and I got "pyautogui". It has the same function with "Autopy", but the command are different. So, better if you read the instructions command in pyautogui website.  Hope this help you bro 😁

fingers = detector.fingersUp() keep inside if loop

I'm having the same problem. couldn't find the solution. if anyone can help with this?

It has been solved by installing new module called "HandTrack" instead of "HandTrackingModule"~.

That also works:  Go to the link: https://www.computervision.zone/courses/ai-virtual-mouse/  (it is in the video description itself)  Since this is the platform where these courses are held, if you subscribe (for free) you can access the codes, including this one that is giving you a problem.  Just copy and paste the 2nd code (HandTrackingModule.py) into your own HandTrackingModule.py file and everything will work as it should.  I was having the same problem just now.

@ddtdilireba  please elaborate how to solve this error!!!

Finally, I finished my First AI Project in 2 days 😁. But, I had a low fps issue. I tried to solve this with some  Metho, one of them is With CUDA. But, My GPU is AMD Radeon RX 570. Any one know the other method(to increase fps/to use opencv with GPU) ? Hope your Helps 🙏. Thanks

You got solution?

It occurred to me too and I solved it by installing Python 3.7.9 version. Have you solved it?

unistall cvzone and down grade it's version to 1.4.1 then the program should work just fine, handDetector attribute has been removed frrom HandTrackingModule in later versions of cvzone 🤓

@shreyanshmalviya4968  I quitted opencv as I couldn't find more resources on it. And I know that by conda I can install multiple environments

@shreyanshmalviya4968  but do u know any further resources

​ @Ary0n  The whole internet can be used as a resource all you need to do is to learn to properly use a web browser and discover what you are passionate about.  Set goals with determination so that you have a goal to work upon with your interest.  I'm learning OpenCV because I want to convert the ironman hologram into reality I have been working on it for around 3 days before that I only knew c++ and today I have decent knowledge about python. I learnt everything from the internet.  BEST Of Luck.

@shreyanshmalviya4968  buddy there is a difference between more common thing's like python whose courses who can find in abundance. But niche topics like opencv they have only a 3 hour tutorial with some project

@Ary0n , You are right bro OpenCV has limited support but it isn't that less, you can read many documentations that are a lot better than tutorials. Python also has a PyPI website to support modules. stack overflow is always available for our errors .opencv. org is a lot better than tutorials. I think we don't have good resources to learn Opencv but we can just start making our projects directly using the OpenCV .org website. these resources are still enough as we have many examples like Murtaza who utilized these resources to become better. I hope you got my point.

It needs an if statement to check if the hand is available. You can check out the latest version of the cvzone package it contains the fix of this bug.

@murtazasworkshop  you solve ? i have same problem

It is enough to put try except in the parts that give error.

The same error occurred to me but don't worry You may be using Python 2.9 or above version but autopy supports till Python 3.8 version you can see on the pypi website. I resolved the issue by downloading version 3.7.9  Hey, don't worry about older versions you can install both the versions on your pc to use them just switch the path of your compiler.

@shreyanshmalviya4968  TNX bro to inform me

I am also getting the same issue bro!! Have you got solution??

I am having problem in installing autopy sir please can I get help🥺

Hey! I got an error in this. I have been working on this for quite long now and it isn't solving. While running AiVirtualMouseProject.py,  it gave an error in " if self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]][1] < self.lmList[self.tipIds[0] - 1][1]: IndexError: list index out of range" I understand its meaning, but somehow i am not able to sort this out. If someone could tell me how to correct it, or connect somewhere to clarify, that would be great.  Thakyou ❤️

Hey guys, so most of u facing issues with autopy and i also faces this issue. All u need to do is install python 3.7 and select that interpreter in project and then it will be installed. I am using PyCharm for this :) Let me know if u have nay doubts :)

I do not know it is not working

Does it use an algorithm?

Can someone please help me with installing autopy? ... i have install rust.. now it says it cannot find rust compiler "error: can't find Rust compiler"

Can you share code of showed in the video?

Does this work in MacOS. I mean all libraries used are available for Mac?

Whic IDE Or Twxt Editor You are Using

Autopy cant install ?

Sir there is an error in the code plz help

Greetings from Peru excellent video you are a great programmer I wish you many successes in your career Thank you for the explanatory video

I can't install the autopy library

Please help I got stuck in list index error for fingersup function...🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Have you got the solution?

I have the same problem

I am getting the same error, have you solved the issue??

@batulbohra4431   have u find the solution? Please tell me

@Urmila Singh do you got any solution please post it would be really helpful..

I found that this error fires when it can't find fingers (maybe hand out of camera), so lmList is empty.  I wrapped code in fingersUp  if len(self.lmList):       ...... else:      fingers=[0,0,0,0,0]

@Sherevv  Bro, did the problem get resolved after wrapping up with what you commented. I am facing the same issue, Could be great if you help

def fingersUp(self):         fingers = []         if len(self.lmList):             if self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]][1] > self.lmList[self.tipIds[0]-1][1]:                 fingers.append(1)             else:                 fingers.append(0)              for id in range(1,5):                 if self.lmList[self.tipIds[id]][2]< self.lmList[self.tipIds[id]-2][2]:                     fingers.append(1)                 else:                     fingers.append(0)         else:             fingers = [0,0,0,0,0]         return fingers

@Sherevv  could you explain it how did you resolve this issue

Take from..."fingers = detector.fingersUp()" .... to ...." autopy.mouse.click() " under if condition

I  have same problem.Could this problem be related to access on macos?

Just install python 3.7, it worked for me. I am using PyCharm I hope it will help you too :)

@nbjayson1947   i am using python 3.7

@alladayeshwanth9340  so what is the problem u r facing?

Follow the link in the description

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1) change the 1 to 0

Incase you get this error  "x1, y1 = lmList[8][1:] ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)"  Solution check you HandTrackingModule file and update this line of code   self.lmList.append([ px, py]) to    self.lmList.append([ id,px, py]) Hope this helps someone

lmList, bbox = detector.findPosition(img,handNo=0)  ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)  Can someone help me to fix this error?

bro, same error occurred

Not sure if it helps now but I had the same error. It happens because, for example, if your screen is 1280x720p you can't move the mouse to the point (1280, 720), the "maximum" point that it accepts it's actually (screenWidth - 1, screenHeight - 1) or (1279, 719)p in this case.  So to solve the problem you just have to redefine wScreen and hScreen as [wScreen = (wScreen - 1)] and [hScreen = (hScreen - 1)]. I hope that helps, it was actually kind of hard for me to explain it in english.

i creat a developement environnement with anaconda, and install all what i need. than i use this env as interpretor , and when i need new dependencies, i just go to anaconda prompt, conda activate nameOfMyEnv and than pip install whatINeed  my env use python 3.8 and everything works, but i see peoples resolving this with changing to python 3.7

bro the autopy library is not working

Can you make a video on how to detect specific mouse movement patterns ? such as detecting if I make the pattern of a number 4 or whatever.

It installs on Python 3.7.9

@nomad4253  Thank you, but I found its alternate (pyautogui)

Download python 3.7.9, install it, and select that exe file as the interpreter in pycharm settings. Then install all necessary packages

@nomad4253  that doesn't help as i have to manually install packages through cmd

@yuvrajjadhav8270  No u don't have to. I think you are selecting interpreter 3.9 but use 3.7 let me know if it works :)

@nomad4253  Thanks a lot bro... It actually worked for me

Just install python 3.7, it worked for me. I am using PyCharm I hope it will help you :)

Plz reply

Install an older version of python, recommended is 3.8. Use py -3.8 to choose the version.

@tigerz777  thanks bro

same with me, does it installed for you yet??

You can use pyautogui library instead of autopy

@lakshitrustagi8531  does it have the same functionality and objects of autopy?

Yes

This guy uses pretrained  models

I wanted this yaar thx

His would be very useful in AR desktop applications.

- - DOUBT - -  First of all your videos are really awesome and informative. When I wrote the 'AiVirualMouseTracking.py' file for that file I had to install 'autopy' but even after every method of installation it still somehow seems that autopy is unable to download in my visual code studios and I think the error everytime comes when the "building wheel" starts. I tried using 'pip install autopy' and download the .whl file from the pypi.org and tried github sources and their zip files but nothing seems to work. Can you please tell what the problem might be or if there is some other module that we could use for instead of the autopy module ?  - - DOUBT - -

Use python 3.7.9

dude just change your python version to  3.7.9   it worked for me

@shethridham23  youre a savior man. I too had the same issue. But this version of intrepretor works like a charm. Thank you

creat your own developement env and than install in what you need i did that with anaconda, i just go in my env with anaconda "conda activate nameOfEnv than pip install what you need  use this env as entrepretor for all your python project

@shethridham23  bro if I change to 3.7.9 I'm unable to install mediapipe and when I switch to 3.9 I'm unable to install autopy  Plz help

If you are using virtual env. then you have to install it for every new project. Or you can install opencv on you system once and use it in any project by importing it.

Thank you

Go though the "Learn Opencv in 3 Hours" Course to get started with Computer Vision.

Thank you for your kind words. With you solid support it does not feel far away.

how did your autopy worked ? I am getting problem in installing it.

@visheshmalhotra4448  you can go to your command prompt and write pip install autopy, or terminal if you use Mac

@moking8646  not install dude

Just write HandDetector instead of handDetector(H is capital) also install cvzone 1.4.1 for resolving any further errors

I will be listing down some books on my website very soon .

Was wondering if you could show how to see the methods inside of a package like mediapipe so we know some of the options  that are available. Thanks.

Thanks man for making this video

I did it before you but it was very slow and noisy  Thanks it is very helpful video

You are so amazing.. teaching all the complex things super simply.. i have learned a lot from you.. thank you..

Super tutorial sir but how to see the code as the link does not gives the code for anything pls do help

It was an awesome video. Your ideas are brilliant. I am expecting some more videos on object detection, tracking, objectron from the mediapipe library. Keep up the good work.

Sir/brdr, you'll not believe I was thinking how could I develop hand tracking to mouse hovering, since past few days, and I just opened YouTube, and there you were  Come on!! You read my mind

Bro am facing problem in installing autopy, how to fix it  .

@bhavanap1140  same here

If you are facing a problem with installing autopy,  then use python 3.6.  Or you can use an alternative of it. Like Pyautogui. It works like a charm when I first tried.
