1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,680
I swear I'll spend more time looking for the parts I need than actually building anything.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:28,180
Hey what's happening guys in our last video we used an op amp TLO72 as a gain stage in an

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:37,820
oscillator. Today we're going to use a different op amp the LM386 as what it's intended for an audio

4
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:45,600
amp. So I don't know if this exactly fits into the classic circuits you should know mold but we're

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,980
going to show you how to set up an LM386 super easy using its internal gain to make yourself a basic

6
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,940
little audio amplifier. So the first thing we need to do to do that is we need an audio source.

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:08,420
I got all kinds of options for audio sources but I like to keep things simple and if you've been

8
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:17,460
watching the channel for a while you know my favorite IC of all time is the 555 timer. So I have set up

9
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:28,740
here a simple bi-stable 555 timer I'm sorry a stable 555 timer and it is oscillating at about a kilohertz

10
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:37,940
which we can take a look at here. The 555 timer as you know outputs a square wave but square waves

11
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:41,300
don't sound good you know frankly they're not good for speakers they're not really audio

12
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:51,940
they're actually digital. But what I've done here is I simply set up a low pass filter these are 150

13
00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:00,100
ohm resistors one microfarad capacitors three stages should give us an approximation of a sine wave.

14
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,500
No we're not going to look at it on the scope because you know what very few people actually have scopes

15
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,220
and I want everybody to be to know that they can do these kinds of projects and experiments at home

16
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:20,820
you don't have to have a scope there's other ways so we're going to use this cheap Zotec ZT-M0

17
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,220
auto manual meter in frequency mode

18
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:41,540
and if we come up here and we put her on pin three you see we get 1.075 kilohertz close enough to

19
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,460
one kilohertz for government work and after our filter

20
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,020
well that's showing 16 hertz but that's not true that's just because the voltage is so low

21
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,460
so you're not getting anything there at all

22
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,940
yeah don't worry we're still getting it and I'll show you that as well

23
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,300
again without the use of a scope all we need is a speaker

24
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:20,180
so we'll plug the negative lead of the speaker into our negative rail and we'll touch its pin three

25
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,820
and you can hear the one kilohertz tone we'll touch it here after the first stage

26
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,340
it's much quieter more of a sawtooth

27
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,780
smoother it's a triangle wave there and now this is going to be extremely quiet

28
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,780
I don't know if you're gonna be able to hear it or not but there is sound there

29
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:52,740
so listen carefully and you should be able to barely hear the sine wave try and get this up

30
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,260
as close to the camera as I can here we go

31
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:14,260
there we go so that's our sine wave but the amplitude has been limited by our low pass filter

32
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,620
so what we want to do is we want to amplify it we're going to use an lm386 audio amplifier let's

33
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,980
be bop over to the computer and have a look at the data sheet

34
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:34,580
all right so here is the data sheet for our lm386 low voltage audio power amplifier

35
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,540
and we have it in the 8 pin dip package and there's some information tells you works on battery

36
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,460
operation with minimum external parts and that's the truth and a supply voltage of 4 to 12 volts which is

37
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,660
excellent we're going to be using that it has low quiescent current drain that means when it's not

38
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:02,900
active that's your your gain now your voltage gain here from 20 to 200 ours is going to be 20 which is

39
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,580
the built-in internal gain okay and then we have some applications here

40
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:18,740
what's ours going to be portable tape tv sound line drivers yeah just a small audio amplifier i guess they

41
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:24,820
don't list that here you can see the schematic of how it's built and if you take a look here

42
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,340
i mean what is it made up of

43
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,380
i know you're all yelling it's made up of transistors i know but check out how many transistors

44
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:52,020
are in here if i get them all one two three four five six seven eight nine ten transistors

45
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:13,060
one two possibly three diodes is that a diode that's strange one two three four five six seven resistors

46
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,340
so i mean that's pretty cool there's a lot of stuff there

47
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,460
come down here and you get your basic information there is our pin out

48
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,340
input minus input plus ground bypass blah blah blah

49
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:39,460
tells you what your pins are here inverting input non-inverting input

50
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,820
absolute maximum but we're going to roll on down here

51
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,620
to the application circuit typical application this is the lm 386 with an internal gain of 20

52
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:00,580
and this is what we are going to set up here today just super simple we're going to put it together and

53
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:08,100
we are going to make it work now you see this will be a non-inverting amplifier because the inverting pin

54
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,980
is grounded we have a volume control here on the non-inverting pin

55
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:24,820
other than that we have a nice big dc blocking capacitor going to our speaker a little filtering going

56
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,180
on here and that's all she wrote let's do it

57
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:41,700
okay i think we're ready to go and get started you can see we have our circuit diagram here and

58
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,180
there are three pins we will not be connecting one eight and seven one and eight are where you can

59
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:52,740
connect i believe it's a capacitor for uh external gain and then seven is a bypass that we're not going

60
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,420
to be using either so we shall bring in our circuit

61
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:10,980
and avail ourselves a lovely lm 386 who will it be who will be who wants to come out and play you okay

62
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
so you know ic's always have splayed legs

63
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:24,420
they make tools for this but hey we don't like tools just put them on your bench give them a little

64
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,580
bendy bendino and you're good

65
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,260
we'll put him way over here

66
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:43,460
all right so let's start by hooking up our power supply that's the pix that's the pittsburgh way to

67
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:54,580
say power power like former steelers coach bill cower car we have some nice breadboard jumpers the reds are too

68
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,140
long so we'll go with an orange

69
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:11,540
and that's pin six one two three four five this is pin six right here so pin six goes to power

70
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:23,300
the pin four is our ground

71
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,660
we use gray for ground

72
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,020
i just want to make sure that you're hooking your pins up correctly

73
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:43,380
that's why an old guy like me has one of these doohickeys on his head

74
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,220
okay so that's pin four that's that pin eight

75
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,380
is our output so let's grab a longish

76
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,580
connector

77
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,340
and go from pin eight

78
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,180
over to here

79
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,660
then we need a 0.05 microfarad why would you say 0.05 microfarad why would you do that

80
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,060
because now you got to make me do internal head math

81
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,740
it's 50 nanofarads i think i'm sure somebody will correct me if i'm wrong i don't probably don't have

82
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,140
50 nanofarad but i probably have 47 nanofarad

83
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,060
and you know what they say close enough for government work

84
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,620
unless of course you work for nasa in which case you should probably use

85
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,740
the specified value there's no reason

86
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:59,380
that i'm going to this way you could go that way it'll be just fine and now it says we need a

87
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:07,460
resistor to ground 10 10 what well since they put a k over here let's assume that's 10 ohms

88
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,060
so let's see if we got a 10 ohm

89
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:20,180
15

90
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,780
there's one we could twist 10 of them together if nothing else happens

91
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,700
100 10 r yeah

92
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:48,580
enough for government work

93
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,060
get that guy out of there

94
00:11:53,060 --> 00:12:05,060
one reason to have three foot long leads so we'll just trim them a little bit

95
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,820
and there is our 10 ohm

96
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,300
resistor to ground

97
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:31,700
get in there come on all right 10 ohm resistor to ground next we need a large

98
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,940
capacitor we're going to use an electrolytic 250

99
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,700
microfaradays

100
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,580
i got 220

101
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:49,060
220 or 330

102
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:55,780
let's go 330 when you're doing capacitors you should always err on the size

103
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,940
caution 330

104
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,260
capacitors of course long leg positive

105
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,980
but i like to trim mine to the same length because that's how i roll

106
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,340
the same length so i'm going to go

107
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,420
and that guy

108
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,740
go there like that

109
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,260
yeah nice

110
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,780
okay pin two

111
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,420
which is our inverting input

112
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:41,060
also needs to go to ground

113
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:43,540
i'm looking for another

114
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,820
gray one here

115
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,460
come on

116
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,140
my fingers are far too large

117
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,620
to reach in there without some manner of assistance

118
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,780
so pin two

119
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,340
one two two and four

120
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,180
four two both going to ground

121
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,100
okay

122
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,140
okay

123
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:30,100
okay there's our first mistake that's pin eight our output is in fact pin five

124
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:38,260
i know some of you guys are sitting there screaming at me

125
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,300
you put it in the wrong hole

126
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,460
not like i haven't heard that before

127
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,340
only one golfing of course

128
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,460
okay let's try this again here

129
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,260
pin five that's much better

130
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,460
and make sure yep going the right direction there

131
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,700
so next we need a 10k pot i have a 10k pot right here

132
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:38,020
get her to plug in nice and neat like

133
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,700
yeah success

134
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:48,980
that is

135
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,300
okay that is fully on

136
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,620
that's off

137
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,460
hopefully we'll put it about

138
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,660
halfway to start out with

139
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,420
so the middle pin our wiper needs to go to pin tree

140
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,860
one two three oh look at that

141
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,820
i almost got it right

142
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,180
story of my life

143
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:28,900
okay

144
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,380
and this one needs to go to ground

145
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,620
hey caramba i gotta find another gray ground pin in here

146
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,700
hey we got lucky

147
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:49,780
these cheap bread boards sometimes just require a little

148
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,460
massaging to get them to go in right

149
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,820
definitely want to make sure you have them seated properly

150
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,620
okay

151
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,900
and then this one is our connection

152
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,460
over

153
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,140
so

154
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,020
trying to see if i have

155
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,140
something of the proper length

156
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:22,580
not really

157
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:22,660
not really

158
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,020
what we'll do

159
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,860
we'll take one of these

160
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,700
longer gray ones here

161
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,780
and we'll just give it the old bendaroonie

162
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,340
just like that

163
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,100
now

164
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,940
assuming that i put everything together properly

165
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,180
we should be good to go

166
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,340
oh

167
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,580
we must hook up our sprecker

168
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:09,620
spreckens the electronics

169
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:19,300
the negative

170
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:22,420
positive

171
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,580
and

172
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,020
the power

173
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,220
i'm putting about 5.5 volts in from my

174
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,300
bench power supply what do you think

175
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,420
will she make noise or will she go kablooey

176
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,100
one way to find out

177
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,940
okay seven eight and one are not connected

178
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:54,100
everything else is connected

179
00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:01,460
and we have no sound

180
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:04,980
hmm

181
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,340
wiper pin three

182
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,260
pin six is positive

183
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,740
not getting warm

184
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,620
like this there

185
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,980
all right let's uh

186
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:37,620
make sure we are still oscillating

187
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,540
okay

188
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,860
you know why is that showing me 50 hertz

189
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,220
that hold on or something

190
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,900
what is going on here

191
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,220
well first problem was

192
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,700
i had it on square wave out

193
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,340
and not hertz in

194
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,140
so yeah we are still getting

195
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,620
our oscillation

196
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,460
good

197
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:33,780
but why

198
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,260
are we not getting

199
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,660
an output

200
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:55,380
to the speaker

201
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,740
what have we done wrong

202
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:09,540
hmm

203
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,060
all right i'm gonna shut off the power here

204
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,420
shut that off

205
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,940
all right let's have a think

206
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,820
all right pin one

207
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,300
not connected

208
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,580
pin two

209
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,420
connected to ground

210
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,380
pin three to the wiper

211
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,860
one two three

212
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,580
pin four one two three four to ground

213
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,020
pin five is our output

214
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,860
which goes to our blocking cap

215
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,300
and also

216
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,380
to this filter

217
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,500
pin six is our voltage supply

218
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,100
seven is not connected

219
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,580
eight is not connected

220
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:10,500
all right turn the power back on

221
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,660
i'm gonna put this guy over here

222
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,060
set for six volts dc

223
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,820
let's see

224
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,260
we are getting at the pins

225
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,860
five point two five point six two

226
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,660
and our power supply is showing five point sixty so that's good

227
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,140
all right let's look at six volts ac

228
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,820
and see what we're getting out

229
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,940
yeah we're getting oscillation out

230
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,060
as you can see

231
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,900
hard to do and not block the camera at the same time

232
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,140
well we were getting it or we're not getting it now

233
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,780
try and put it here

234
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,180
and here

235
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:26,820
no

236
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,140
now let's just connect the speaker

237
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,860
here

238
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,020
now you see

239
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,740
we're getting dc out

240
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,940
this should actually be blocking dc so

241
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,300
shouldn't get anything at all here

242
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,620
we've got an offset here because this is actually

243
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,340
the dc

244
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:07,700
all right

245
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,820
just for um s and g's

246
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,740
let's take out

247
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,460
our blocking capacitor

248
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,980
yeah if it's blocking

249
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,140
all of the dc we're not going to hear anything

250
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,780
so let's see what we get now if we turn it on

251
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:38,260
okay

252
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,020
still nothing

253
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:52,980
have a look here

254
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,340
yeah i'm seeing two and a half

255
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:07,860
hmm

256
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,580
to the data sheet robin

257
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,900
so unfortunately the data sheet didn't give me any clues

258
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,620
i guess it's not on right now

259
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,580
unless that pot's bad

260
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:27,140
uh resistance resistance resistance

261
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,340
10k pots we'll put it on

262
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,900
60

263
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:40,020
we'll be

264
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,060
reading zero

265
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,180
reading eight

266
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:49,320
close enough for government work.

267
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,840
Let's flip on the power supply again.

268
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,820
I'm going to take you out of here so you can see.

269
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,080
Oh.

270
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,240
Did you hear that?

271
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,100
Did you hear it?

272
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:21,100
It appears to be working.

273
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,460
Turn it up.

274
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,740
Well, ain't that a miracle.

275
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,460
All right, boys and girls.

276
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:55,320
I have no explanation of why it didn't work before, but now it works.

277
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:05,960
Anyway, the whole point of this was to show you how to set up the LM386 audio amplifier.

278
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:14,920
We set it up as prescribed in the manual for the internal 20x gain.

279
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:27,560
And after, I don't know, I just, I don't get it.

280
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,200
I don't get it.

281
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,280
I don't get it.

282
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,620
But whatever.

283
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,140
Sure works.

284
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:36,780
I don't get it.

285
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,140
I don't get it.

286
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,780
I don't get it.

287
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
I don't get it.

288
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,380
I don't get it.

289
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,240
I don't get it.

290
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,400
I don't get it.

291
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,880
give me a thumbs up give me two thumbs up sometimes life's just a mystery that's it I'm out

292
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,500
