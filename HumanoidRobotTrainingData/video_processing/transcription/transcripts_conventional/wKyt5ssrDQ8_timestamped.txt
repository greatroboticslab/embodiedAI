[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:01.880] Hey pilots, it's Nick here from Part-Time Pilot.
[00:00:02.040 → 00:00:03.800] Today's video, we're going to talk about stalls.
[00:00:04.840 → 00:00:08.140] So this is part of my Fundamentals of Aerodynamics video playlist.
[00:00:08.640 → 00:00:12.740] If you click the icon popping up in the top right of your screen,
[00:00:12.900 → 00:00:15.440] you can be able to check out the other videos in that playlist.
[00:00:15.640 → 00:00:16.480] And it's only growing.
[00:00:16.720 → 00:00:18.560] And if you want to know when I add a new video,
[00:00:18.920 → 00:00:21.960] be sure to subscribe by clicking the subscribe button in the bottom right.
[00:00:22.040 → 00:00:24.700] Before we get started, I just want to mention there's a link in the description
[00:00:24.700 → 00:00:28.520] to a free study guide you'll see forward slash free study guide.
[00:00:28.520 → 00:00:30.020] It takes you to my website.
[00:00:30.280 → 00:00:31.860] All you got to do is enter your email.
[00:00:32.000 → 00:00:32.940] That is all you have to do.
[00:00:32.980 → 00:00:33.840] And it's completely free.
[00:00:33.940 → 00:00:38.500] You'll get a study guide with over 170 plus slides of stuff like this.
[00:00:38.580 → 00:00:40.900] It's perfect for studying for the FAA private pilot written
[00:00:40.900 → 00:00:42.880] or your oral checkride coming up.
[00:00:43.300 → 00:00:45.380] Okay, let's get to stalls.
[00:00:45.800 → 00:00:51.100] So here we have a chart of lift, coefficient of lift,
[00:00:51.180 → 00:00:57.400] which for our purposes is going to be lift versus angle of attack on the x-axis.
[00:00:58.520 → 00:01:07.400] Now, as the angle of attack increases from left to right on the chart,
[00:01:07.820 → 00:01:11.600] you see that lift has a linear relationship with it.
[00:01:11.600 → 00:01:15.180] So as angle of attack increases, lift increases.
[00:01:15.180 → 00:01:23.940] However, lift only increases until a certain point before it rapidly turns around and starts to decrease.
[00:01:24.180 → 00:01:31.120] This point is a certain angle of attack, okay, called the critical angle of attack.
[00:01:31.120 → 00:01:37.260] Once the critical angle of attack is reached, again, lift is reduced rapidly.
[00:01:37.400 → 00:01:39.400] This is what's happening during a stall.
[00:01:39.860 → 00:01:46.800] You're going past that critical angle of attack and your lift is being diminished in a snap.
[00:01:47.180 → 00:01:49.520] And that's why your aircraft's nose is going to drop.
[00:01:49.520 → 00:01:54.900] Let's look at what this looks like on an aircraft's airfoil.
[00:01:55.660 → 00:01:56.960] So here we have an airfoil.
[00:01:57.320 → 00:02:03.120] We have the angle of attack, which is between the free stream air here and the cord line here.
[00:02:03.660 → 00:02:06.060] Let's say the critical angle of attack is 20 degrees.
[00:02:06.180 → 00:02:08.640] So right now we're at an angle of attack of 20 degrees.
[00:02:08.820 → 00:02:11.120] So we're at the critical angle of attack.
[00:02:11.120 → 00:02:18.920] Again, a stall is caused by the airfoil of an aircraft's wing exceeding the critical angle of attack.
[00:02:19.000 → 00:02:20.900] So we're at that point here on our diagram.
[00:02:21.860 → 00:02:27.280] When the critical AOA is exceeded, flow can no longer stay attached to the top of the wing and become separated.
[00:02:27.740 → 00:02:29.880] So usually you have flow coming here.
[00:02:30.420 → 00:02:36.520] Usually the flow stays attached to the wing and follows the shape of the wing like it's doing here on the bottom of the wing.
[00:02:36.520 → 00:02:42.700] But when you exceed the critical angle of attack, the flow can't turn the corner sharp enough.
[00:02:42.780 → 00:02:43.720] It can't go like this.
[00:02:45.180 → 00:02:50.520] Instead, it separates from the wing and starts to make these vortices behind the wing.
[00:02:51.020 → 00:02:53.320] This causes a huge reduction in lift.
[00:02:53.960 → 00:03:00.020] To recover from a stall, the key thing is obviously to get the AOA back under the critical angle of attack.
[00:03:00.100 → 00:03:03.160] So the flow becomes reattached over the wing.
[00:03:03.640 → 00:03:05.660] So you want the flow to reattach over the wing.
[00:03:05.660 → 00:03:12.040] So this is why you want to pitch down as soon as you stall to get back below that critical angle of attack.
[00:03:13.040 → 00:03:21.660] Alright, so now that we've seen it here, I want to show you a cool little gif that shows you how the flow stays attached when you're below the critical angle of attack.
[00:03:21.820 → 00:03:24.380] And once you exceed that, it no longer is attached.
[00:03:24.380 → 00:03:32.560] Okay, so here we have an airfoil that is slowly increasing until it reaches that critical angle of attack.
[00:03:32.640 → 00:03:38.820] And at first you can see these white streamlines are flowing over the top of the airfoil.
[00:03:38.820 → 00:03:42.200] And they're almost reaching to the trailing edge of the airfoil.
[00:03:42.200 → 00:03:46.920] But then you can see there's a point where you get all this black space behind the airfoil.
[00:03:46.920 → 00:03:50.740] And almost the white streamlines turn smoky.
[00:03:50.740 → 00:03:57.020] And this is the point at which you exceed the critical angle of attack and you get a stall.
[00:03:57.020 → 00:03:59.520] Thanks for watching guys.
[00:03:59.660 → 00:04:01.160] I hope you learned a lot.
