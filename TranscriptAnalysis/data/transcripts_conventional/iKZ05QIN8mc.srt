00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,040
Greetings everyone and welcome back to the bench. This is your weekly dose of

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:14,760
AudioTech. Okay, on the bench today we have two audio amplifier ICs, the LM1875

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:23,400
and the TDA2050. My all-time favorite audio ICs. Really love these things.

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,680
Should be obvious. I've done videos on these before, but I want to do an in-depth

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:38,320
comparison of these to see which one stands on top. Well, let's start off that

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,560
they're both pretty good, but there are some differences in them, and that's what

7
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,640
we're going to take a look at today. But first of all, why do I like these chips so

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,200
much? Well, they're simple 5-pin T0220 type packages. They don't require a lot of

9
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,080
extra components to make a nice little amplifier. You know, there's no mute or

10
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:08,500
standby pins that require extra components. And you know, on some of the chips with

11
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:14,160
the mute and standby, you have to use Zener diodes that hold the voltage in a

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:22,420
certain range so the chip stays in play mode. Like the TDA7264 has that type of

13
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,420
arrangement. It's kind of annoying. But with these, there's no mute or standby pin to

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,820
worry about. They're designed to have very good audio quality, low distortion, no

15
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,820
stability issues. And with some of these chips, I've seen in the step response

16
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:46,640
tests, which we'll look at today, that some of them did oscillate. They were easier to

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,080
make oscillate. And, well, I still have to test the TDA2050, but the LM1875 had no

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:00,400
problems in that test. Like I said, I do have to test this TDA2050, and we'll

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:07,960
check that out today. You can set them up for single supply or dual supply operation.

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,720
In my experience, they're reliable. You know, my main listening amp has the TDA2050 in it,

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:23,400
and it's on constantly for 10 years straight, and no problems with it. I never turn it off.

22
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:32,100
So as long as you use a good layout and big enough heatsink, it'll be just fine. Now these are what I

23
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:40,100
call the 20 watt class amplifier ICs. I mean, you can squeak more power out of them. In one of my

24
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:49,840
videos with the LM1875, I was able to get 40 watts, actually a little over 40 watts out of it. But that

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,760
was running it at its maximum supply voltage, which I would normally not do. But still, yeah, you can get

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:06,100
25, 30 watts out of these things. Okay, so I have first off the LM1875 here on these little boards.

27
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:15,420
I talked about these kits before. Have a really nice, well laid out board. Nice ground layout here.

28
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:22,720
You got the ceramic caps, bypass caps for the power supply. We're pretty much right at the

29
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,820
pins of the chip. And they go right into the ground plane here. And yeah, these are just excellent boards.

30
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,360
And because the TDA2050 has the same pin out, I can use it on the same board. Though I will have to

31
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,780
change the Bougereau cell components because they require a different value. We'll take a look at that

32
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,140
as well. I'm going to start out doing a power test. I'll measure it at three different voltages. If you

33
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:04,500
want a more comprehensive power test results, well, a few years ago, I did a test of the LM1875. I tested

34
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,420
it at a bunch of different load resistances and supply voltages. But I'm just going to do three

35
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,420
different ones here to compare the two chips. As always, I have my signal source going into the

36
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:30,180
preamp so I can control the level. That goes into the amplifier here. Non-inductive 4 ohm load on the

37
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:39,860
output. And the power supply is hooked up. I have these reservoir capacitors. You know, they're connected

38
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:49,060
here close to the chip. And the power supply is set up. And we'll run a few power tests. I'm actually

39
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:58,580
going to start out at plus or minus 12 volts. So we'll dial that in. And what I'll do here, I'll take

40
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:07,860
one measurement on camera and then I'll do the rest off camera to save time. Okay, power measurement time.

41
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:21,060
So we can dial out the clipping there. Right about there. And I have to put more waveforms on the

42
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:28,980
screen to get an accurate measurement. See, it always stays the same. But if I don't have enough

43
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:36,340
waveforms, you get a different number here. You get a higher number. So you get the wrong information.

44
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:50,180
Okay. So we have 6.61 volts RMS squared divided by 4 ohms. So 10.9 watts. That's plus or minus 12 volts.

45
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,780
Okay, power test.

46
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,740
7.18 volts RMS.

47
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:14,020
By that by 4 is 12.8. Actually, 12.9. The 1875 was doing 10.9. And this one is doing 12.9.

48
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:22,820
So it's delivering a little more power than the LM1875 at the same supply voltage. But I'll run through

49
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,660
some more supply voltages and take some more measurements here and see how it stacks up at the

50
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:39,460
end. Okay, so now I'm looking at a condition called rail sticking. That's when you send the amplifier into

51
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:45,860
clipping. And you'll notice that it wants to stay stuck to the rail a little bit. You can see a little

52
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:52,100
notch there on the top and bottom, especially on the bottom. See how it's sticking to the rail a little

53
00:06:52,100 --> 00:07:04,260
bit. So I'm using a 10 kilohertz signal. So we can see that clearly. And with the LM1875, you can see that

54
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:11,540
there is a little bit of rail sticking. That's because the transistors don't want to come out of

55
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:23,140
saturation or well, at least clipping. What that can do is when you do clip, that can make the clipping

56
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:31,780
sound a little bit more harsh. So the less you see it, the better. And we are running at 4 ohm load,

57
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,980
so it's going to be harder for the amplifier not to do that with the lower impedance load.

58
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,380
Okay, let's check rail sticking. This is 10 kilohertz with the 4 ohm load TDA 2050.

59
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:56,900
Oh yeah, pretty bad. Look at that rail sticking. Much worse than the LM1875.

60
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:06,420
So I'll stop that so I can turn off the amplifier. So they might be optimizing the chip to give more

61
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,460
output. But whenever you do stuff like that, you might be giving up something like stability or,

62
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,980
you know, something like this rail sticking. And it's pretty bad here. And we have Snickers here.

63
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:29,300
I'm going to pass through here. I don't know where he's going. I think he's going to lay in the corner there.

64
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:36,820
Yeah, whatever. What you're going to do? Oh, grab the camera here. He's going to knock the camera over.

65
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,620
He's going out.

66
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,100
Okay, I think we're safe now.

67
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,500
Okay, now I'm going to do a frequency response test. In a way, it's kind of a pointless test,

68
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,140
because it really depends on the external component values that you use. If I don't run the test,

69
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:05,380
people will complain about it. So anyway, we'll go ahead and run it. So we're at one kilohertz

70
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:14,100
at four volts. Normally, you test the amp at around one watt, but I'm testing four watts with the four ohm load.

71
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:24,260
We'll see what the frequency response turns out to be. I'm on the Fieldtech function generator here.

72
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:38,580
Okay, I'm at 20 hertz, and it's still completely flat. Let's take it down until it starts to roll off.

73
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:50,660
Okay, it's starting to roll off. We're at eight hertz. Okay, let's go up. That's three hertz.

74
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:02,020
Right there, we're about three dB down, and that's four hertz. I would say that's, uh,

75
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,980
for audio purposes, that's more than good enough.

76
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,580
Okay, we're at 20 kilohertz, and of course, it's flat. Like I say, just to make people happy,

77
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,460
we'll go higher. Okay, that's 70. 70 kilohertz.

78
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,100
Starting to roll off a little bit.

79
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:47,380
100 kilohertz. Ever so slightly off, but I mean, it's flat. This amp is completely flat,

80
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:54,980
way beyond the audio spectrum. Okay, we're going to do another test. What test is this?

81
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,940
Ah, we're going to do a frequency sweep here, using the ol' field tech.

82
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:11,140
So we're at, again, we're at this Graticule, upper and lower is zero dB. So we'll turn this thing down.

83
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,580
Again, probably a pointless test. These are going to be

84
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:22,900
flat throughout the frequency response here.

85
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:30,820
Okay, that's 20 hertz, and you know, it's pretty flat. It's still there.

86
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:38,980
That's 10. It's just like the LM 1875. It has the same capacitor values on the input

87
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:44,500
and the feedback. So you're going to see the exact same result. So we'll go ahead and

88
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:54,740
sweep this up to 20 kilohertz. Turn that off a second so I can get this set.

89
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:09,380
Well, we're there already. 25! Crink it up. Crink it up to something crazy. Yeah, it's flat. I'm not

90
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:17,540
a monkey with it anymore. So now I'm going to do step response tests. I have this microcontroller

91
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:25,700
programmed to give me a 10 kilohertz square wave. The reason I'm using that, it's the fastest square

92
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:32,420
wave or the cleanest square wave I can produce here on my bench. So yeah, the microcontroller does that.

93
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:42,180
It goes into the input. And I had to rig up a little thing for the scope. Set the probe to 10,

94
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:54,260
or yeah, 10 times. And I'm plugged into here. Problem is, if I scope at the load, I get a very small ring.

95
00:12:54,260 --> 00:13:00,900
You know, it's on the scope. It's only, you know, like a couple pixels tall on the scope screen there. But

96
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:09,060
when I set this up, it's a lot better. It'd be better to hold it here, but it's kind of inconvenient. So

97
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:15,300
I'm going to rig this little connection up here, and it seems to work okay.

98
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:25,780
Okay, we're looking at the square wave here. We have the 4 ohm load and a little bit of undershoot.

99
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:31,780
That could be from the microcontroller. But it's a pretty nice looking square wave.

100
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,740
I'm going to magnify it a little bit.

101
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:47,380
I have to test this at different signal levels. The idea is to put a capacitance across the output,

102
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:54,340
a pure capacitance, and see how the amplifier handles it. If it rings or oscillates. Of course,

103
00:13:54,340 --> 00:14:00,900
it's going to ring somewhat. It's just natural. But as long as it doesn't break out into an oscillation,

104
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:08,980
we're okay. Or, you know, excessive ringing as well. So let's get on with it here.

105
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:17,620
Okay, we'll start with a 10 nanofarad cap across the output.

106
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:29,460
And I'm not really seeing anything. I probably should turn this up the other way. See, there's

107
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:37,540
clipping. I'm going to get into clipping. You can get a little bit of a wiggle there. But that's not

108
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:45,620
really caused by the capacitance. Because I take it out. It's still there. So I'll turn that down

109
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:57,060
between tests so I'm not dissipating excessive power. Next, I'll plug in this 0.1 microfarad or 100

110
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:07,700
nanofarads. See, that's causing a little bit of an overshoot on the negative side. And that's a little

111
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:15,460
little bit of a ring. Very, very light. Let's unplug that.

112
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:28,020
See, it goes away when I take it out. So let's see if I can zoom in on that a bit.

113
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,860
Examine that.

114
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,860
See, that's why you have to test at different levels. Because see, it's

115
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,780
not doing it there. It might be

116
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:54,420
an oscillation, considered oscillation, because it goes on long enough. But just not sure it's

117
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:02,740
enough to worry about. It could be an inductance thing too. Let me touch it right at the output

118
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:13,060
terminal. Yeah, it's still there. It's not really breaking out into an oscillation continuously.

119
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:21,380
Okay, step response test with a 220 nanofarad.

120
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:36,740
Yeah, that's somewhat bothersome. I'm seeing this oscillation here on the bottom rail.

121
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:46,820
Note they say, thou shall scope the supply rails. See if that appears there. If it does,

122
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:54,420
we're having filtering issues of the supply rail. So let's see what it looks like.

123
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,020
And it's not too bad, but I am seeing that. It's glitching.

124
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:15,940
You know, just my trigger thingy up there. See that's showing up on the supply rail. It's not

125
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:20,500
nearly as much as what I had it set to.

126
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,420
100 millivolts per division. That's pretty significant.

127
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,860
I'm being let down by my supply bypass filtering.

128
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,700
I want to see maybe if I can fix that.

129
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:48,580
Okay, I installed 0.22 microfarad ceramic caps, X7R 100 volts.

130
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,740
Always use the X7R type. Always use at least double the supply voltage.

131
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,580
Good reason for doing that, which I won't get into here.

132
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,780
I'm going to see.

133
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,860
And it did not fix it.

134
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,340
Still there.

135
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:18,020
I had to go with my intuition and what you think is right, but this time I am not correct.

136
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:24,900
Apologies for the glare on the scope. That's just what it's like shooting in the daylight.

137
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm going to have to throw a towel or something over this window.

138
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,900
I have blinds, but they're not good enough.

139
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,980
Well, I'm going to install what's known as a teal network.

140
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,740
I think the name comes from Neville Teal,

141
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,100
of the teal and small fame, the loudspeaker people.

142
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,180
I guess that's where that comes from.

143
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:52,500
What it is, it's a coil in parallel with a resistor.

144
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:59,860
It's on the output of the amplifier, and it reduces the effects of capacitive loads.

145
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,980
Amplifiers do not like to drive capacitive loads,

146
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,300
and that's one reason why we're oscillating with that capacitor.

147
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,300
In real life, you would probably never see that kind of capacitance on the output.

148
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,780
You know, pure capacitance at that level.

149
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,900
But still, I don't think the amplifier should be oscillating.

150
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,220
So I'm going to put this in series with the output and see if it does anything.

151
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,980
Okay, let's see what happens here.

152
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:40,420
It's still there, but it's almost diminished.

153
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,340
It's a lot less than it was.

154
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,220
So what I'm doing there, I have, I don't know, about 12 turns around that resistor.

155
00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:00,500
I'm guessing that's probably like .3 microhenries of inductance on that coil.

156
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,700
Um, probably could use more like .7.

157
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,860
You really shouldn't have to go above one microhenry.

158
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:15,140
So yeah, I'm not going to monkey around with it anymore.

159
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I can see that this is already working.

160
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:23,380
All right, for crying out loud, I'll try a bigger coil.

161
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,820
No one would like to see that oscillation removed as much as I would,

162
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,380
or at least diminished more.

163
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,100
And, uh, you don't have to wrap it around the resistor.

164
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,860
I just do that out of convenience.

165
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,060
It makes it more compact like a single component.

166
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,260
So, let me get this set up and see if it works or not.

167
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,380
All right, here goes nothing.

168
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,580
Ah, much better.

169
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,940
This is what you want to see.

170
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,900
Just a little bit of ring that diminishes to nothing.

171
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,460
And yeah, that cleaned it up.

172
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,380
A little bit of overshoot.

173
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,900
A little bit of ring, but it's not oscillating like it was.

174
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,540
So that took care of the problem.

175
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,980
The value of that coil is probably closer to one microhenry.

176
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,180
I don't think it's over that.

177
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,700
There's a calculator where you can measure the diameter,

178
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,660
number of turns, and the length of the coil.

179
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,020
And it will tell you how much inductance that is.

180
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,300
But, hey, I'm guessing it's probably around one microhenry.

181
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,460
Step response test.

182
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,540
This time it's with the TDA 2050.

183
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I mention that so when I'm editing the video,

184
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,060
I get all the clips in the right place.

185
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,580
Okay, we don't have any capacitor.

186
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:58,500
We're getting a little bit of ring on the bottom.

187
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
A little overshoot here, a bit of ring.

188
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,780
So the TDA 2050 is not nearly as stable.

189
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,780
Well, we can't say that yet.

190
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,980
It's not unstable.

191
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,460
I mean, some ringing doesn't mean it's unstable.

192
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,460
Until we pop those caps in and see what happens.

193
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,700
So let's try that.

194
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,740
Okay, this is the 10 nanofarad.

195
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,700
And it looks like it's not going to have any effect.

196
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,580
No, it doesn't do anything.

197
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,820
It's pretty much the same.

198
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,140
So you unplug it here and there's no change.

199
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,780
Okay, we have the 100 nanofarad end.

200
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,540
Oh yeah, it's starting to affect it.

201
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,900
Getting a longer ring there.

202
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:49,740
Okay, now it's the 270 nano.

203
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Ooh, she broke out into some mean oscillation.

204
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,660
Yeah, this is really...

205
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,060
The TDA 2050 is a lot less stable than the LM1875.

206
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,820
So let's see if that little coil...

207
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,500
You know, it's not in the circuit right now.

208
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
So I'll put it in the circuit and see if that corrects the problem.

209
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,860
Okay, the coil is put in.

210
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,140
Yeah, that makes quite a difference.

211
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,060
It's not completely going unstable like it was.

212
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,460
Yeah, it's kind of a long ring there, but it damps out.

213
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,860
It's not totally freaking out like it was before and oscillating.

214
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,060
That makes a big difference having that teal network in there on the output.

215
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
That's why you see it in audio amplifiers.

216
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,060
Pretty much all consumer and professional.

217
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,860
You really need that to keep the amplifier stable.

218
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:04,460
Now again, would the amplifier really see that much pure capacitance and everyday use?

219
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,660
Probably never.

220
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,020
But if you want to be sure your amplifier is going to be absolutely stable,

221
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,940
you really need to have that coil there.

222
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,100
Okay, I'm hooked up to the computer through an attenuator.

223
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,460
So, let's see if we're going to be able to see the signal.

224
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,060
And we're looking at the distortion.

225
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,220
We're at 1 kilohertz.

226
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,980
That's the fundamental right there.

227
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,380
This is my pilot signal.

228
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,620
It's at 4.5 kilohertz at 1%.

229
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,420
And if you look at the total harmonic distortion plus noise, it's exactly 1%

230
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,740
because that's that large node it's measuring.

231
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:51,580
It's also seeing this, but since this node is many dB higher, that's going to dominate that reading.

232
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:52,940
So, 1%.

233
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,380
And you see the total harmonic distortion is 0.02 something.

234
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,140
It's flipping around there.

235
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:10,380
But, you know, the biggest peak here is about minus 80.

236
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,140
Now, this is not quite at 0.00.

237
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,660
So, it's relative to that.

238
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:20,940
So, it's about minus 80 dB down at one peak.

239
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,500
That looks like a third.

240
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:27,180
So, distortion is very low.

241
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,260
This is the TDA2050.

242
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,340
I'm measuring here.

243
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,820
And now I want to try an intermodulation distortion test.

244
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,660
Okay.

245
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,580
I'm looking at the intermodulation distortion of the TDA2050.

246
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,660
I have an 18 kilohertz and 19 kilohertz signal.

247
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:51,100
And you'll see these little sideband nodes here.

248
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,500
Well, the highest ones are down around minus 80.

249
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,740
And there's really nothing else showing up in the spectrum.

250
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,860
So, you know, that's pretty low.

251
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,060
And I'm using the high frequencies.

252
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:12,060
I'm way up in the audio band because that's where solid state amplifiers will produce more distortion.

253
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,260
But, yeah, there's nothing to worry about here.

254
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,220
Okay.

255
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:22,620
We're looking at the harmonic distortion of the LM1875.

256
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,860
One kilohertz fundamental pilot signal.

257
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,140
And, well, I'm a little bit surprised here.

258
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,940
Look at the second order harmonic.

259
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,980
That's sticking up pretty high here.

260
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:45,500
0.075.

261
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,380
Wasn't the TDA2050 like 0.27, I think?

262
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,620
So, this is quite a bit higher.

263
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,020
I mean, it's still under 0.1.

264
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,860
But it's a lot higher.

265
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:02,540
I would expect it to be better than the TDA2050.

266
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:11,500
But, at least with this chip, the one I'm using here, it has higher distortion.

267
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,700
So, a little bit disappointing there.

268
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:16,540
Okay.

269
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,980
So, now we're looking at the intermodulation distortion of the LM1875.

270
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,820
We have the 18 and 19 kilohertz signals.

271
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,500
You can see the little side bands.

272
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,620
But, they're below minus 80, which is very good.

273
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,860
However, look here.

274
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,580
We're getting nodes down here.

275
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,020
This is one at 1 kilohertz.

276
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,740
Remember, the TDA2050 was clean down here.

277
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,260
I'm starting to wonder if maybe...

278
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,340
Did I screw something up?

279
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,300
I don't think so.

280
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,900
I didn't really change anything.

281
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,180
It's just that that chip is showing more distortion.

282
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,740
Well, I swapped out this chip.

283
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,580
It's the one that came with the kit.

284
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,980
And, I believe them to be authentic.

285
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,980
But, I swapped it out with one that I know is authentic that I bought from DigiKey or Mouser.

286
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,060
And, same performance.

287
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,620
A little bit disappointed.

288
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,660
I thought the LM1875 would do a little better in the distortion department.

289
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,860
Though, like I said, it's nothing bad.

290
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:37,020
But, I guess I have newfound respect for the TDA2050 as far as distortion performance goes.

291
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,660
Okay.

292
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,980
So, let's take a look at the results here.

293
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,820
This is the power measurements.

294
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,300
Plus minus 12 volt supply.

295
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:52,620
You can see that the TDA2050 did better as we noted earlier.

296
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,020
But, look as we increase the supply voltage.

297
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,740
The TDA2050 really picked up momentum.

298
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,820
It does have a higher current.

299
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:12,460
I know when you get around 20 volts, the current limit of the LM1875 starts taking effect.

300
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,540
That's because, yeah, we are using a 4 ohm load.

301
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,540
I wanted to challenge the chips a bit.

302
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,900
Use a 4 ohm load.

303
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,180
So, at 20 volts, we're looking at 29.7 versus 35.2.

304
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:31,100
And, at 24, 34.2 to 43.6.

305
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:37,660
So, as far as output power goes, the TDA2050 is really doing a good job there.

306
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:47,420
As far as the rail sticking issue, the LM1875 did a lot better there.

307
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,780
The TDA2050 had a lot harder rail sticking issues.

308
00:29:52,780 --> 00:30:01,420
That's really only an issue if you play the amp loudly and, you know, you hit clipping quite often.

309
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,460
You'll hear that more as a harsher type of clipping sound.

310
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:10,140
So, the 1875 did a lot better there.

311
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,780
Frequency response, yeah, kind of pointless.

312
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,820
They were all flat.

313
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,620
They were all flat.

314
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,020
They were all flat.

315
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:17,580
They were all flat.

316
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,220
They were all flat.

317
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:18,700
They were all flat.

318
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,500
They were all flat.

319
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,380
They were all flat.

320
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,700
They said, well, you know, they're all flat.

321
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,100
They were flat.

322
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:21,600
They were all flat.

323
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,140
They were flat.

324
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,620
The LMA1875 had a very mild oscillation.

325
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,420
I don't think it would be a problem in normal use.

326
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:39,900
Because, like I say, I doubt you would ever have a pure 270 nanoFarad capacitance across the output like that.

327
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:50,880
and the 2050 became really unstable and really needed that teal network on its output again the

328
00:30:50,880 --> 00:31:01,020
distortion that was pretty surprising to me and that I have this written backwards hold on a second

329
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:10,780
okay so yeah the 1875 had higher distortion than the TDA 2050 which was a surprise to me

330
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:18,220
because if you look at the data sheet it looks like it would be opposite looks like the TDA 2050

331
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:26,060
would be the one with higher distortion but at least in my test the TDA 2050 did quite a bit better

332
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:33,400
but again in both cases the distortion is so low that I don't think it would be an issue

333
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:41,280
you know it's under 0.1 not an issue in either case it's just that you know just looking at these two

334
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:48,500
numbers how much better the 2050 was intermodulation distortion I'll have to see if I can set up that

335
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:56,500
software to actually measure it I was surprised again to see that the TDA 2050 was showing quite

336
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,660
a bit better performance there and we're seeing a lot of nodes down around one kilohertz with those

337
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:10,240
tests with the 1875 where there were none with the 2050 last but not least is issues with the built-in

338
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:19,960
current limiter circuit I've noticed with reactive loads that the TDA 2050 would make like a loud

339
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:28,060
clicking sound or a popping sound if you're using a really reactive load like a forum speaker in a

340
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:35,620
ported box and just at the right frequency where the impedance is pretty hard to drive it would cause

341
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:43,060
the TDA 2050 current limiter circuit to kick in and when those kick in with reactive loads you get a

342
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:50,200
really you know like a pop sound or a click on the kick drum beats you might notice that in older

343
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:57,700
stereos from the 70s like your various receivers when you really push them hard with forum loads you'll

344
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:04,900
sometimes get that effect that's because of the current limiter circuit that's way a lot of do-it-yourselfers

345
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,620
don't include current limiters in their amplifier designs because it's really hard to set those

346
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,740
up to protect the transistors without seriously limiting current and I don't want to get into

347
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:25,600
that much it's kind of a complex subject but the LM1875 that I never had a problem with that I noticed

348
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:33,900
that when driving transformer loads I was using it as a step-up inverter and in some cases with the 2050 I

349
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:40,620
would get that raspy sound when the current limiter kicked in you can hear the buzz in the transformer

350
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:48,300
and well the 1875 had no issue with that it has the better more complicated current limiter circuit

351
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:54,620
obviously so yeah it's kind of a back and forth battle between them you know one chip does better in

352
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:02,720
one area worse than others where the other did better in one area and worse than the area where

353
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:09,840
the other chip did better you know it wasn't a clear winner here but I was really surprised with those

354
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:17,660
distortion test figures that really surprised me you know if the LM1875 did better there I would have

355
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:25,760
declared it the winner but yeah I just can't say that now so yeah this is really interesting it's an eye

356
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,960
opener for me so that's going to do it for this one really appreciate you watching this was an all-day

357
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:41,300
project I mean I had these boards off and I had to swap them I had to take them off to change these

358
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:49,580
capacitors here and I had some issues with the solder joints breaking loose when I pushed down on these

359
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:59,540
connectors to screw in you know to clamp down on these these conductors here I had a solder joint break

360
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:06,800
here I had a solder joint break here that's why I do not like these blue connectors there are some the blue

361
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,960
ones that are better quality but these are awful the ones that came in these kits don't use them

362
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,800
they're awful and yeah I had to swap the chip out and test that because I was kind of curious what was

363
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:34,580
going on with my beloved 1875 which well I lost a little respect for it anyway found that 2050 you probably

364
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:43,100
should have an output teal coil on it you know the the network there with the resistor and coil but

365
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,180
yeah I think I said enough that'll do it for this one thanks for watching
