1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're going to talk about basic aerobatics and more advanced aerobatics with a quadcopter.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We'll go ahead and start and get in the air.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And first thing we're going to do is talk about doing a right or left roll.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So that's going to be this direction on the aileron stick.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And what we're going to do is as we roll, we're going to add throttle, we're going to roll,

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and then we're going to lower throttle and then catch with more throttle.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So what I mean by that is this, add throttle, roll, catch with throttle.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So if I don't do that, I'll get more of a wider roll.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I keep throttling, you see how it's a little wider.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But if I pull throttle out, three, two, one, it's more of a linear roll

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and I don't get a lot of sideways action.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Once again, add throttle, reduce throttle, add throttle.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now if we want to do a front flip or back flip, it's roughly the same thing.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We add throttle, we go forward, and then we add more throttle at the bottom.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So here we go.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Add throttle, flip, add throttle.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And once we do that flip, all we're doing is pushing forward and then letting go of the stick

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and coming back to the level and catching it with the cyclic stick and then adding throttle.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So to do a little bit more advanced stuff, let's go ahead and do a loop.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Now that we know how to do flips and rolls, we're going to go out here to the side.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And I'm going to come towards us and just pull a loop.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm just going to do a little baby loop here for us.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going to come towards us, add throttle, and keep pulling back on that elevator stick.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to try it one more time when we back up.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So we're going to add throttle to get speed, add throttle, pull back, and then come out of the bottom.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That was kind of a short loop, but again, you can kind of get the idea.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's how you do a basic loop.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
One more time, adding throttle, pulling elevator all the way through, and then stopping.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So we'll come back here to center.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And now we'll kind of go ahead and just string stuff together.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to go out and fly out and just have a good time, and I'll kind of talk through

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
some of it.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Here we go.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So I'm doing some stuff.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Right rolls, left rolls, flips.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Go ahead and do traversing flips, pirouetting stuff.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Getting a little far out here, but we'll do it.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is kind of the real basic aerobatics, kind of some stall turns.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The pirouet on the bottom.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Again, you can kind of see what my hands are doing here.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just adding slight inputs at a time, catching it with throttle.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Again, it's not a helicopter, so it doesn't float.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But reducing throttle is probably the biggest importance in aerobatics with quads so that you

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
don't carry through.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What I mean by that is this.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If I go ahead and roll and add throttle, you see how it's a very aggressive snap roll.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll try it again the other way here.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's really aggressive.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can still make it look cool, but you just don't, the quad just tends to not like it.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But that's it guys.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Basic aerobatics.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Try different things.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Slips, loops, rolls, add pirouettes if you can, and you'll start to become a pro pilot.

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thanks for watching guys.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
See ya.
