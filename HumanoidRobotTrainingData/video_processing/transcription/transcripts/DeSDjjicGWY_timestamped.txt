[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:17.440] So, I finally did it. After stating in a video from 2017 that I would finish a DIY drone by 2022,
[00:00:18.160 → 00:00:26.000] I am happy to say that I was finally able to put together this drone. Which can in fact fly but
[00:00:26.000 → 00:00:32.240] I am still a beginner when it comes to controlling it. Now you probably already noticed that this is
[00:00:32.240 → 00:00:39.520] not your standard drone like for example DJI mostly makes them which fly rather slow and controlled
[00:00:39.520 → 00:00:48.000] so that you can make beautiful recordings. No, this is an FPV or first person view drone meaning
[00:00:48.000 → 00:00:53.680] you can not only see what the drone sees while flying but it also moves way faster through the
[00:00:53.680 → 00:01:00.080] air and thus lets you capture some unique video footage with the help of a GoPro on top.
[00:01:01.120 → 00:01:07.680] And the reason why I built this was that months ago I got a beginners FPV drone kit that came with a tiny
[00:01:07.680 → 00:01:15.520] drone which works wonderfully but can easily get blown away by the wind. So, I wanted something a
[00:01:15.520 → 00:01:21.920] bit bigger and heavier and I feel like I went overboard here but you will see that later.
[00:01:21.920 → 00:01:28.800] Before that though let me show you my journey of building this thing which was not super easy to
[00:01:28.800 → 00:01:34.560] do because the drone market just overflows with different hardware, communication protocols and
[00:01:34.560 → 00:01:42.000] software. But luckily after this video you should have a good idea of what is going on and you should
[00:01:42.000 → 00:01:46.560] be able to build something similar. So, let's get started!
[00:01:55.040 → 00:02:01.280] This video is sponsored by Keysight who have a huge virtual event coming up called Keysight World Innovate.
[00:02:02.160 → 00:02:08.080] It is 4 days long and during that time industry leaders and experts will share their vision of future
[00:02:08.080 → 00:02:16.720] technology which involves 5G and 6G, electric and autonomous vehicle advances, quantum technology
[00:02:16.720 → 00:02:22.640] and much much more. If that sounds interesting to you then check out the link in the video description.
[00:02:24.480 → 00:02:30.800] Let's start off by exploring what parts we need for drone and let's use my completed one as an example.
[00:02:30.800 → 00:02:37.360] The first obvious part is of course a frame onto which all other components get mounted on.
[00:02:38.400 → 00:02:45.200] Next are the motors with propellers that create the upward thrust while spinning and of course we also
[00:02:45.200 → 00:02:52.480] need a battery to power it all. Then some kind of receiver that like the name implies receives a signal
[00:02:52.480 → 00:02:59.760] from a remote so that the drone knows what direction to follow. And since we are dealing with an FPV drone,
[00:02:59.760 → 00:03:07.920] we also need a camera and a VTX system with fitting antenna of which I honestly also never heard of before.
[00:03:08.880 → 00:03:14.800] It stands for Video Transmitter and it basically takes the camera video signal and sends it out as
[00:03:14.800 → 00:03:21.520] a 5.8GHz signal that the FPV goggles which we also need can then receive and play back.
[00:03:22.560 → 00:03:26.640] And the last things they are missing are the VC board and ESC board.
[00:03:26.640 → 00:03:32.480] Now FC stands for Flight Controller and it is basically the heart of the system.
[00:03:33.440 → 00:03:39.760] It for example comes with an accelerometer IC which the drone uses to find out how it is positioned in
[00:03:39.760 → 00:03:46.640] the air and through the help of an integrated PID control loop it can then tell each motor how fast
[00:03:46.640 → 00:03:53.360] to spin so that it can stand upright in the air without crashing. Of course it also manages to receive
[00:03:53.360 → 00:03:58.720] controller signal, camera signal, outputs the VTX signal and much much more.
[00:03:59.600 → 00:04:06.880] The only big thing it cannot do directly is driving the BLDC motors for which we got the ESC board
[00:04:06.880 → 00:04:13.680] aka electronic speed controller board that drives the motors at a specific speed depending on how the
[00:04:13.680 → 00:04:20.560] flight controller demands it. And those were all in all the basic components required for an FPV drone
[00:04:20.560 → 00:04:28.000] and I started my component hunt by firstly looking for a frame. The reason is that depending on whether
[00:04:28.000 → 00:04:33.360] you choose a small or big frame all the other components have to be smaller or bigger too.
[00:04:34.240 → 00:04:40.480] And honestly speaking I didn't feel like buying a pre-made frame because when 3D printing a frame
[00:04:40.480 → 00:04:47.680] you can always easily replace parts and by using PETG filament you also get reasonably strong parts
[00:04:47.680 → 00:04:54.480] which eventually though can also break. So I searched for suitable models on printables
[00:04:55.040 → 00:05:02.480] and eventually found this 6 inch one whose design I really liked. I asked his creator whether I can
[00:05:02.480 → 00:05:09.520] showcase it in the video and he agreed and even helped me a lot during the build so big thanks to him.
[00:05:10.560 → 00:05:14.240] And with the model selected I started 3D printing all parts
[00:05:14.240 → 00:05:21.680] and while that was going on I was looking for motors on Amazon which the model trader actually advised me
[00:05:21.680 → 00:05:28.960] not to use. The reason is that they often come with low quality bearings so he instead recommended this
[00:05:28.960 → 00:05:37.120] motor in combination with a 4S battery. With the given kV rating using a 4S battery should give me an
[00:05:37.120 → 00:05:47.440] average RPM of 37,814 which is above the RPM thrust graph I created in a previous video and thus it should
[00:05:47.440 → 00:05:55.040] easily lift 500g meaning 4 of them should be able to do 2kg which I thought was more than enough.
[00:05:56.080 → 00:06:02.400] And by the way I would highly recommend checking out the video I just mentioned because it shows you
[00:06:02.400 → 00:06:08.240] very well how battery, ESC, motor and propeller interplay with one another.
[00:06:09.200 → 00:06:16.720] But anyway the datasheet of the motor also stated that even with only 50% thrust it is capable of
[00:06:16.720 → 00:06:26.800] lifting 563g so I was pretty sure that those should work. Next for the propellers I was advised to get 6 inch
[00:06:26.800 → 00:06:36.480] ones but once I saw how close they get to the drone maybe turning it into drone goulash I instead went with generic 5 inch ones.
[00:06:37.440 → 00:06:46.320] For the battery like I said before I went with a 4S one with a capacity of 2.2Ah and most importantly a
[00:06:46.320 → 00:06:54.000] high C rating which basically says that it can output a high current and thus a high power which is more than
[00:06:54.000 → 00:07:01.600] enough to enjoy the maximum power of all 4 motors. Moving on, next was the receiver and remote part
[00:07:02.160 → 00:07:09.040] and for that I wanted to reuse the remote from my beginners drone kit. Luckily it apparently comes
[00:07:09.040 → 00:07:17.520] with the ELRS communication protocol that can be used for modern drones. As a comparison back in the old
[00:07:17.520 → 00:07:24.880] days all your drone remote inputs would alter one data channel at the receiver which is basically a standard
[00:07:24.880 → 00:07:32.400] servo signal. But since dealing with so many data channels is just confusing, modern remotes and
[00:07:32.400 → 00:07:38.800] receivers just talk to the flight controller through a receive and transmit line and thus we reduced for
[00:07:38.800 → 00:07:46.320] example 9 data wires to just 2. The bad news is though that there are a ton of different protocols from different
[00:07:46.320 → 00:07:55.600] manufacturers but like I said ELRS is apparently not only supported by my remote but also new and great
[00:07:55.600 → 00:08:01.760] and I could easily get a fitting 2.4GHz ELSR receiver for pretty cheap from the internet.
[00:08:02.800 → 00:08:10.400] So next I also wanted to reuse my old goggles which was also not a problem because all 5.8GHz
[00:08:10.400 → 00:08:16.400] transmitter systems should work with them so I simply got one that was currently available.
[00:08:17.440 → 00:08:22.640] And the camera was also a suggestion from the model trader which I didn't regret.
[00:08:23.680 → 00:08:31.680] Ok last but not least a flight controller and ESC and here I was told that pretty much anything would work
[00:08:31.680 → 00:08:37.680] as long as the ESC could handle the motor current, the flight controller comes with a standard size
[00:08:37.680 → 00:08:44.720] device and it uses Betaflight which is the software on the flight controller that basically handles everything
[00:08:45.200 → 00:08:53.760] and that probably most drone owners use. So I decided on this Zeus 60A one because it looked well made
[00:08:53.760 → 00:09:00.880] and came with a decent manual. And thus I finally got all the parts for the drone and if you want to
[00:09:00.880 → 00:09:06.160] build something similar you can of course find a complete parts list with example seller in the
[00:09:06.160 → 00:09:13.040] video description. There you can of course also find the additional parts like screws, standoffs,
[00:09:13.040 → 00:09:20.560] zip ties and everything else. And with that being said I started the actual drone build by firstly securing
[00:09:20.560 → 00:09:26.800] all the motors to the motor arms and then attaching those to the bottom piece of the frame with more screws.
[00:09:26.800 → 00:09:33.280] At this point I was happy to find out that the motor wires were long enough to reach the ESC.
[00:09:34.080 → 00:09:41.600] So I tied them to the arms with the help of zip ties before soldering the XT60 battery connector to the ESC
[00:09:42.160 → 00:09:50.720] along with all the motor wires. Next I soldered the camera wires, receiver wires and VTX wires to the solder pads
[00:09:50.720 → 00:09:58.400] of the flight controller like its manual told me to do so. And after connecting the ESC and FC with the
[00:09:58.400 → 00:10:04.000] help of the given wire it was already time for the first power test with my lab bench power supply
[00:10:04.560 → 00:10:10.160] which as you can hear and also see was a big success for me since nothing blew up.
[00:10:11.120 → 00:10:17.760] And best of all the camera system already worked without configuring anything which was pretty neat.
[00:10:17.760 → 00:10:24.800] What I still had to do though was binding the receiver with my controller and that was more or less a
[00:10:24.800 → 00:10:29.920] nightmare because no matter what I tried my remote didn't want it to do that.
[00:10:30.880 → 00:10:39.360] Eventually I found out that my remote is the FR Sky version which does not support ELRS and thus I had to
[00:10:39.360 → 00:10:47.200] get a new one which does support that but it was certainly not new. The story continues though because
[00:10:47.200 → 00:10:53.200] the binding with the bind button still didn't function. I actually had to not only flash a
[00:10:53.200 → 00:11:00.880] new firmware onto the remote but also a new firmware onto the receiver which was not hard to do but finding
[00:11:00.880 → 00:11:08.160] that out just took me way too long. And thus the remote and receiver finally bound correctly and it was
[00:11:08.160 → 00:11:14.560] time for me to assemble the rest of the frame to find out how I had to modify it so that it can hold my
[00:11:14.560 → 00:11:23.120] camera, GoPro mount and VTX antenna. The model creator also helped me a bit with that and since he uploaded
[00:11:23.120 → 00:11:29.200] the step files of his model I had no problem adjusting a couple of holes and cutouts as well
[00:11:29.200 → 00:11:35.760] and printing some parts again. And that means it was finally time to permanently mount the FC
[00:11:35.760 → 00:11:42.720] and ESC to the frame, secure the camera with small screws on the front as well as the antenna mount in
[00:11:42.720 → 00:11:49.120] the back, add standoffs all around the frame, use zip ties to keep all the wiring under control,
[00:11:49.760 → 00:11:55.920] attach the GoPro mount to the upper frame and finally attach that to the rest with the help of more screws.
[00:11:56.880 → 00:11:59.600] And just like that the drone was mostly done.
[00:11:59.600 → 00:12:06.640] And next I had to connect it to a computer and use the Betaflight configurator software to get all the
[00:12:06.640 → 00:12:13.680] settings right. To do that I first delayed the quads onto a flat surface to calibrate the accelerometer
[00:12:14.320 → 00:12:21.520] and afterwards I configured the receiver system, made sure that the board alignment was correct so that
[00:12:21.520 → 00:12:28.800] in this software the drone moves exactly like it does in real life. I had to alter two controller channels
[00:12:28.800 → 00:12:35.280] so that the quad moves with the controller inputs like you would expect it. I had to add modes to
[00:12:35.280 → 00:12:42.960] for example arm the quad and enter angle modes which is easier to fly and ultimately I checked the motor
[00:12:42.960 → 00:12:48.800] settings and spun up the motors to find out that they in fact all spun in the correct direction.
[00:12:49.760 → 00:12:55.680] And if you want more information about all of the Betaflight settings then I would highly recommend
[00:12:55.680 → 00:13:00.640] checking out the Joshua Boutwell channel who made a video series about this.
[00:13:01.520 → 00:13:08.400] But anyway with the configuration complete I added the propellers to the motors while making sure which
[00:13:08.400 → 00:13:15.360] ones are the clockwise and counter clockwise ones. And after then charging up the battery and securing it
[00:13:15.360 → 00:13:22.320] to the frame with velcro strips it was finally time for the first proper test in my hands to see whether
[00:13:22.320 → 00:13:28.560] the drone would follow the directions I pointed to with the controller which it did just fine.
[00:13:29.520 → 00:13:36.880] So I did a proper flying test next which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I should get used
[00:13:36.880 → 00:13:44.080] to disarm the drone to get it to land. And the last test I then did in the garden was with the GoPro on top
[00:13:44.080 → 00:13:56.560] which during the first run worked surprisingly well but during the second attempt the system oscillated
[00:13:56.560 → 00:14:03.520] a bit and got out of control. I think this is a good time to mention that I am using the standard PID
[00:14:03.520 → 00:14:11.600] values for my drone here which do work but are not perfect. So next I wanted to do a bigger test on
[00:14:11.600 → 00:14:17.920] an empty field which clearly showed me that I will have to practice quite a lot to get any decent
[00:14:17.920 → 00:14:24.640] results with my drone and worst of all as I was getting more comfortable with it it just stopped
[00:14:24.640 → 00:14:33.840] its motors at the highest point yet and crashed to the ground. Needless to say I had to replace a couple
[00:14:33.840 → 00:14:42.000] of 3D printed parts and I am not sure why the system abruptly stopped working. Maybe because I was only
[00:14:42.000 → 00:14:50.160] using half of the original copper wire or maybe because I forgot adding the ESC capacitor. Whatever
[00:14:50.160 → 00:14:57.120] it was this problem did not occur again after fixing those things and I was actually getting a bit more
[00:14:57.120 → 00:15:06.000] comfortable the second time on the fields. I got so confident that I finally tried out flying with
[00:15:06.000 → 00:15:14.640] the goggles on which made things easier and on top was an incredible experience. And with that being said
[00:15:14.640 → 00:15:20.800] you should now have a basic idea of how to make your own drone and always keep in mind that you can
[00:15:20.800 → 00:15:27.040] easily downgrade component parameters to not only save money but also make your drone lighter and
[00:15:27.040 → 00:15:34.160] less powerful because truth be told my one is a bit too big and powerful for my taste.
[00:15:35.040 → 00:15:41.840] But anyway if you enjoyed this video and maybe my other ones then consider supporting me through Patreon.
