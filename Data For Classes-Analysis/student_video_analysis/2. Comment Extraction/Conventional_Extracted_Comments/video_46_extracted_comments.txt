Is the matrix multiplication @7:30 correct? I know we should get the result to the right, but the multiplication is not making sense to me... Did i get an information overload and making a mistake in multiplying the matrices?

Thank you for this lecture series. It helped me on my way to get some certifications for robotics motion.  I look forward to your series on kinematics , dynamics .  Your teaching style is the best makes it easy to access these mathematically complex concepts in an easy to understand manner. Thanks a lot. I’ll refer your channel to my other classmates in my robotics class in spring 2023 when I formally take up the subject in my university 9 months from now.

The explanation was crystal clear. Could you also provide a good refrence which covered these topics in much more detail.thanks in advance

Thanks, Dr, it really helps.

Really love your teaching mam...... you helped me score good grades in my Robotics class this semester

Thanks for catching the mistake!!! the first matrix should be transposed and the transpose sign is overlooked!!! Great job!

Thanks for comment. Glad that they were helpful.

Amir, thanks for your feedback. The references used to create the videos are listed in the description of each video. Feel free to check them. There are two textbooks that are used for these lessons.

You are very welcome!
