[00:00:00.240 → 00:00:04.800] This might look like just a regular old tricopter drone, but unlike a typical tricopter, all
[00:00:04.800 → 00:00:11.440] of the motors tilt with a single servo so it can spin at extreme speeds.
[00:00:11.440 → 00:00:13.320] Why would I want it to spin so darn fast?
[00:00:13.320 → 00:00:17.000] Well, when fitted with some wings on the arms, and when the tilt angle of all of them is
[00:00:17.000 → 00:00:21.560] just right, it actually requires substantially less power to hover than if the three motors
[00:00:21.560 → 00:00:25.420] were just oriented vertically like a regular tricopter drone.
[00:00:25.420 → 00:00:26.640] This seems very counterintuitive.
[00:00:26.640 → 00:00:31.780] If we tilt the motors to enable this spinning, a substantial fraction of their upwards thrust
[00:00:31.780 → 00:00:33.400] force is lost.
[00:00:33.400 → 00:00:38.540] If they tilt to 45 degrees for example, that's half of the total thrust now pushing sideways
[00:00:38.540 → 00:00:40.100] and not up.
[00:00:40.100 → 00:00:44.060] This means that the drone will fall if throttle isn't increased.
[00:00:44.060 → 00:00:48.240] Using our intuition of a regular drone without additional airfoils fitted to it, this would
[00:00:48.240 → 00:00:52.180] mean that to hover with the motors at this angle, they would basically need to double their
[00:00:52.180 → 00:00:56.480] power to match the vertical thrust component with the downward weight of the vehicle, enabling
[00:00:56.480 → 00:00:57.480] a steady state hover.
[00:00:57.480 → 00:01:02.660] But when we add these wings and make it spin by tilting the motors, the power required to
[00:01:02.660 → 00:01:04.800] hover actually goes down.
[00:01:04.800 → 00:01:05.800] Way down.
[00:01:05.800 → 00:01:08.200] This almost seems like a paradox.
[00:01:08.200 → 00:01:12.920] We lose a lot of upwards thrust by tilting the motors, but somehow reduce power required
[00:01:12.920 → 00:01:14.320] to fly.
[00:01:14.320 → 00:01:18.540] In this video, I'll explain why this is, and show off this cool new VTOL platform I've
[00:01:18.540 → 00:01:21.720] been developing.
[00:01:21.720 → 00:01:24.740] This was a fairly basic drone build with a few exceptions.
[00:01:24.740 → 00:01:28.260] The center hub is 3D printed with bearings pressed fit into the arm mounts to allow them
[00:01:28.260 → 00:01:29.840] to rotate freely.
[00:01:29.840 → 00:01:33.900] A single standard sized servo at the center with a bevel gear actuates all three tilting
[00:01:33.900 → 00:01:35.440] arms at once.
[00:01:35.440 → 00:01:40.340] Out at the end of the arms, I have some regular old mini quad motors with 5 inch propellers.
[00:01:40.340 → 00:01:43.920] All of the parts and print files I used for this build are linked in the description if
[00:01:43.920 → 00:01:47.640] for whatever reason you want to build one of these flying abominations yourself.
[00:01:47.640 → 00:01:51.680] As always with my builds, I'm using my open source Arduino based flight controller DreamFlight
[00:01:51.680 → 00:01:53.820] to do the flight stabilization.
[00:01:53.820 → 00:01:58.820] I've added an SD logger and current sensor so we can gather power data while in flight,
[00:01:58.820 → 00:02:01.800] and a lidar distance sensor for altitude hold.
[00:02:01.800 → 00:02:05.580] And this is my best attempt at squeezing all these electronics on the center hub.
[00:02:05.580 → 00:02:08.080] Not bad, but not great.
[00:02:08.080 → 00:02:11.980] So with all of this assembled, it flies fine just like any other tricopter, and there's
[00:02:11.980 → 00:02:14.120] definitely no shortage of yaw control.
[00:02:14.120 → 00:02:18.100] I've actually configured the flight controller so that as it spins faster, the tricopter
[00:02:18.100 → 00:02:20.760] stabilization fades out completely.
[00:02:20.760 → 00:02:24.220] It's actually passively stable at these high speeds, though I still don't have any
[00:02:24.220 → 00:02:25.220] directional control.
[00:02:25.220 → 00:02:29.240] We'll save that problem for another video, so all of the spinny flights in this video
[00:02:29.240 → 00:02:33.000] are limited in length by how far the thing drifts around in the wind.
[00:02:33.000 → 00:02:37.160] With stability taken care of, there's still a small problem that needs to be addressed.
[00:02:37.160 → 00:02:41.400] If we want to measure and compare power consumption at different angular speeds, we need a way to
[00:02:41.400 → 00:02:45.080] hover at a fixed altitude much better than I can do manually.
[00:02:45.080 → 00:02:48.780] For reference, here I'm trying to hold a hover with the wings on, and you can see that
[00:02:48.780 → 00:02:51.460] it's difficult to keep a constant altitude.
[00:02:51.460 → 00:02:55.480] My bad throttle management would lead to spikes in the power draw, giving us less reliable
[00:02:55.480 → 00:02:57.820] data to look at later.
[00:02:57.820 → 00:03:01.440] So I ended up borrowing the lidar sensor and some code from my last video where we built
[00:03:01.440 → 00:03:05.500] a ground effect vehicle that needed to fly a few inches off the ground.
[00:03:05.500 → 00:03:09.760] Mounting this to the side facing down gives a good altitude reading that is used in a simple
[00:03:09.760 → 00:03:14.520] PID controller to increase or decrease throttle depending on if the vehicle is below or above
[00:03:14.520 → 00:03:18.240] the desired altitude of about 4 feet from my tests.
[00:03:18.240 → 00:03:21.940] I spent some time tuning the controller in my living room with the wings off.
[00:03:21.940 → 00:03:26.320] I was pretty happy with how well it held altitude, so I used it as a good opportunity to sharpen
[00:03:26.320 → 00:03:28.860] my basketball skills.
[00:03:28.860 → 00:03:32.600] But note to self, don't put your hand over the lidar sensor that it's using to measure
[00:03:32.600 → 00:03:36.760] distance to the ground.
[00:03:36.760 → 00:03:40.840] Since it now holds altitude on its own, that means when we start spinning and there is any
[00:03:40.840 → 00:03:45.520] change in required throttle, it will automatically adjust how much throttle is commanded to the
[00:03:45.520 → 00:03:46.520] motors.
[00:03:46.520 → 00:03:50.520] This will give us much more consistent power draw data for our comparisons with wings on
[00:03:50.520 → 00:03:53.160] and off.
[00:03:53.160 → 00:03:57.380] Speaking of data, let's look at the power data for the no wings case first.
[00:03:57.380 → 00:04:01.280] As we can see, it takes about 83 watts to hover without spinning.
[00:04:01.280 → 00:04:05.640] Then as we increase our angular speed, we see the power increase as we would expect from our
[00:04:05.640 → 00:04:08.520] intuition about the thrust vector components.
[00:04:08.520 → 00:04:12.340] But then, the power seems to dip a little bit before increasing some more.
[00:04:12.340 → 00:04:13.400] What's going on there?
[00:04:13.400 → 00:04:18.920] Well, this is our first clue at why it is more efficient to spin very fast in hover.
[00:04:18.920 → 00:04:23.780] Propeller efficiency actually changes as a function of incoming airspeed, or inflow.
[00:04:23.780 → 00:04:27.820] For a fixed pitch propeller, the efficiency will increase with inflow until a certain point
[00:04:27.820 → 00:04:30.040] where it drops off dramatically.
[00:04:30.040 → 00:04:34.280] This drop off in efficiency is caused by the incoming air basically being too fast for
[00:04:34.280 → 00:04:37.800] the prop to keep a positive angle of attack while it spins.
[00:04:37.800 → 00:04:42.160] This is why airplane propellers will generally have a higher pitch than flatter looking multi-rotor
[00:04:42.160 → 00:04:43.760] propellers.
[00:04:43.760 → 00:04:48.300] So in the power data, this slight dip is actually the propeller becoming slightly more efficient
[00:04:48.300 → 00:04:50.220] at generating thrust.
[00:04:50.220 → 00:04:54.820] At this angular speed, the inflow to the prop is about 25 miles per hour.
[00:04:54.820 → 00:04:57.160] Beyond this, the power increases again.
[00:04:57.160 → 00:05:01.040] This is the drag from the arms coming into play, which is not too surprising as they
[00:05:01.040 → 00:05:06.940] whip around at 25 miles per hour at the tip.
[00:05:06.940 → 00:05:10.000] So let's get the wings on and take a look at the power data now.
[00:05:10.000 → 00:05:11.620] But first a quick note about my lawn.
[00:05:11.620 → 00:05:13.620] Yes, I'm aware it needs to be mowed.
[00:05:13.620 → 00:05:15.040] No, I won't mow it.
[00:05:15.040 → 00:05:25.700] It actually helps cushion crashes, which I had plenty of when testing my first prototype.
[00:05:25.700 → 00:05:28.580] But the grass does introduce a problem to our power data collection.
[00:05:28.580 → 00:05:33.460] The rough surface of the grass confuses the altitude hold we implemented earlier, making
[00:05:33.460 → 00:05:35.480] it not as smooth as it could be.
[00:05:35.480 → 00:05:40.960] So as a preface to the data I'm showing you, all of it was collected flying over flat pavement.
[00:05:40.960 → 00:05:48.780] And this is your friendly reminder to tighten your props.
[00:05:48.780 → 00:05:51.500] Now we can finally look at the wings on data.
[00:05:51.500 → 00:05:53.400] Just look at how incredible that is.
[00:05:53.400 → 00:05:56.900] The regular hover power without spinning has gone up because of the added weight of the
[00:05:56.900 → 00:05:57.980] wings.
[00:05:57.980 → 00:06:01.860] But as we start spinning, the power required goes way down.
[00:06:01.860 → 00:06:05.380] You can even hear the motor start to spool down as the altitude controller lowers the
[00:06:05.380 → 00:06:07.780] throttle to maintain altitude.
[00:06:07.780 → 00:06:16.140] The most amazing part of this is that the power reduction isn't just a small amount.
[00:06:16.140 → 00:06:18.660] It's reduced by a factor of three.
[00:06:18.660 → 00:06:23.080] That means that this platform can do a loitering hover for three times as long as its regular
[00:06:23.080 → 00:06:25.300] multirotor counterpart.
[00:06:25.300 → 00:06:28.940] Another way to think of it is that it can freely climb to altitude and use no more power
[00:06:28.940 → 00:06:31.780] than the multirotor uses in a regular hover.
[00:06:31.780 → 00:06:40.280] I think it's just so cool how it looks like it's screwing itself upward into the air.
[00:06:40.280 → 00:06:44.300] So why did we get such a large efficiency increase simply by adding wings and spinning?
[00:06:44.300 → 00:06:48.180] Well, it all comes down to energy and momentum.
[00:06:48.180 → 00:06:52.880] Propeller thrust is proportional to the change in momentum of the airflow through the propeller.
[00:06:52.880 → 00:06:57.140] Drag on the propeller is directly proportional to kinetic energy of the air, keeping in mind
[00:06:57.140 → 00:07:00.340] that drag directly relates to power required.
[00:07:00.340 → 00:07:05.120] Take a mental note that the power is proportional to velocity squared, while momentum is proportional
[00:07:05.120 → 00:07:07.400] to only velocity.
[00:07:07.400 → 00:07:11.500] If you have two props, one twice as big as the other, this relation tells us that the
[00:07:11.500 → 00:07:16.440] smaller one would need to move the air twice as fast to generate the same thrust.
[00:07:16.440 → 00:07:21.680] Spinning faster to move the air faster substantially increases the power required, due to that pesky
[00:07:21.680 → 00:07:23.500] airspeed squared term.
[00:07:23.500 → 00:07:28.500] It is simply more efficient to have a larger propeller that spins slower.
[00:07:28.500 → 00:07:31.160] No spinning drone paradox here.
[00:07:31.160 → 00:07:35.220] In our case, we sort of have a hybrid where small, inefficient propellers are doing the
[00:07:35.220 → 00:07:39.460] spinning while a larger, efficient propeller does the heavy lifting.
[00:07:39.460 → 00:07:40.920] Kind of like an airplane.
[00:07:40.920 → 00:07:45.040] By putting the propellers farther out, we increase their moment arm, meaning they need to generate
[00:07:45.040 → 00:07:49.340] much less thrust to overcome the lesser drag of the larger propeller.
[00:07:49.340 → 00:07:53.400] If all of this is too hard to follow, just imagine we took an airplane with less thrust
[00:07:53.400 → 00:07:57.760] than weight, made it fly around in circles, and called it a hover.
[00:07:57.760 → 00:08:00.300] That's the magic of this vehicle's design.
[00:08:00.300 → 00:08:03.960] What's cool is that we now have small drone propellers operating much more efficiently
[00:08:03.960 → 00:08:07.860] in hover on this vehicle with high inflow as we discussed earlier.
[00:08:07.860 → 00:08:11.360] In other words, we don't need two different propeller designs for hover and forward flight
[00:08:11.360 → 00:08:13.480] like many other VTOLs do.
[00:08:13.480 → 00:08:18.800] We can use the same propeller design for both flight modes and get the same propulsive efficiency.
[00:08:18.800 → 00:08:23.080] In the next video, we'll take a look at power consumption in forward flight for this vehicle,
[00:08:23.080 → 00:08:27.040] and maybe even touch on some new control methods so we can get intuitive directional control
[00:08:27.040 → 00:08:28.040] while it's spinning.
[00:08:28.040 → 00:08:31.880] I've got some tricks up my sleeve for that, so make sure to subscribe so you don't miss
[00:08:31.880 → 00:08:32.880] it.
[00:08:32.880 → 00:08:32.940] Cheers!
