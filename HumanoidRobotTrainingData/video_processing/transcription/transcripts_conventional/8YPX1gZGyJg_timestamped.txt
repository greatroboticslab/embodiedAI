[00:00:08.380 → 00:00:10.640] Hey folks, welcome to another video.
[00:00:11.120 → 00:00:14.840] Today I will show you how to discharge a capacitor safely and quickly.
[00:00:15.480 → 00:00:19.840] The capacitors are found in all devices, from microwaves to computers in cars.
[00:00:20.320 → 00:00:24.360] Before working with any device, it is necessary to empty the capacitors.
[00:00:24.760 → 00:00:27.180] This is done very quickly in a safe way.
[00:00:27.180 → 00:00:32.920] As an electrical engineer, I have often seen how people empty their capacitors in the wrong way,
[00:00:33.140 → 00:00:37.500] and, in the process, are shocked by the sparks and the mini explosion that happens.
[00:00:38.040 → 00:00:43.160] I will explain to you step by step how to discharge the capacitors very easily and safely.
[00:00:45.060 → 00:00:48.980] It is necessary to use protection when discharging the capacitor.
[00:00:49.500 → 00:00:55.040] You need insulated gloves to protect you from accidental contact with metal through which electricity passes.
[00:00:55.040 → 00:00:59.280] It is also required to use goggles preventively if sparks occur.
[00:01:02.000 → 00:01:04.820] Capacitors are like mini-bases for power transmission.
[00:01:05.460 → 00:01:08.800] They store electricity in themselves and filter specific signals,
[00:01:09.100 → 00:01:12.820] and further forward the current signals needed for the operation of the circuit.
[00:01:13.280 → 00:01:15.640] And they keep the rest of the electricity inside.
[00:01:16.140 → 00:01:20.040] Depending on the capacitance, the capacitor can store more or less current.
[00:01:20.040 → 00:01:22.260] The capacitor unit is a farad.
[00:01:22.620 → 00:01:26.800] Farad is a huge unit, so it is used pico, nano, and microfarad.
[00:01:27.180 → 00:01:30.000] The operating voltage is also marked on the capacitor.
[00:01:30.500 → 00:01:34.580] If you want to replace the capacitor, you need to put one with the same values.
[00:01:35.040 → 00:01:38.540] You cannot set a lower or higher value of the capacitor than the same.
[00:01:39.060 → 00:01:44.880] The capacitor also has two pins on the sides marked with two signs, one plus and one minus.
[00:01:44.880 → 00:01:49.180] That way, you will know which foot goes to which side in the electrical circuit.
[00:01:49.740 → 00:01:55.280] Connecting the wrong capacitor will destroy your capacitor and may damage the drudge elements in the circuit.
[00:01:55.860 → 00:01:59.860] Never touch or do anything with the appliance or capacitor while it is plugged in.
[00:02:00.260 → 00:02:03.120] The first thing you need to do is turn off the power.
[00:02:03.580 → 00:02:07.520] This will make you safer and more secure when you discharge the capacitor.
[00:02:07.520 → 00:02:16.240] You need three things, insulated gloves, glasses, and a discharge pen.
[00:02:16.680 → 00:02:20.500] A discharge pen is one perfect device that is not expensive at all.
[00:02:20.820 → 00:02:25.040] Which will safely discharge the capacitor without sparks and electric shock.
[00:02:25.500 → 00:02:31.500] The discharge pen drew current from the capacitor, passed it with great resistance, and discharged your capacitor.
[00:02:31.500 → 00:02:36.220] Now connect those two strokes to the discharge pen.
[00:02:36.640 → 00:02:39.580] Be sure to join the ends well and wait a few seconds.
[00:02:40.020 → 00:02:41.640] Then remove the discharge pen.
[00:02:42.080 → 00:02:43.380] Your capacitor is empty.
[00:02:43.780 → 00:02:44.900] This method is hazardous.
[00:02:45.480 → 00:02:47.500] You can make sparks or electric shocks.
[00:02:47.980 → 00:02:52.100] You need to use goggles, insulated gloves, and an insulated screwdriver.
[00:02:52.760 → 00:02:54.980] Suppose there is a capacitor on the board.
[00:02:55.400 → 00:02:58.380] In that case, I do not recommend using this method,
[00:02:58.380 → 00:03:02.600] because you can touch a power line and damage the drudge elements in the circuit.
[00:03:03.180 → 00:03:05.560] Connect the legs of the condenser to the screwdriver,
[00:03:05.900 → 00:03:08.700] so that they both touch the metal part of the screwdriver.
[00:03:09.280 → 00:03:10.820] Do it a couple of times quickly.
[00:03:11.400 → 00:03:13.480] You may see sparks or a small explosion.
[00:03:17.240 → 00:03:18.720] Yes, it's possible.
[00:03:19.220 → 00:03:20.880] In time to drain the capacitor.
[00:03:21.460 → 00:03:23.140] From a long time of non-use.
[00:03:23.580 → 00:03:26.480] If it is not connected to a battery or other power source.
[00:03:28.380 → 00:03:32.620] Very simply connect a capacitor to the battery source.
[00:03:33.060 → 00:03:36.100] If you connect to 3 volts, it charges to 3 volts.
[00:03:36.520 → 00:03:40.300] If you connect to 9, you charge it with 9 volts, and so on.
[00:03:40.680 → 00:03:42.560] The multimeter can also charge it.
[00:03:42.960 → 00:03:45.920] Now you will see how to check the correctness of the capacitor.
[00:03:46.200 → 00:04:01.500] Come on in now.
[00:04:01.500 → 00:04:31.480] Thank you.
[00:04:31.500 → 00:05:01.480] Thank you.
[00:05:01.500 → 00:05:31.480] Thank you.
