Therefore, decoupling capacitors are very critical to the output sound of a speaker. The video explained several noise elimination techniques such as shielding, filtering, differential signaling, grounding, isolation, surge protection, and ground loop elimination. It was helpful for Phase 2 by showing how to test for noise sources and eliminate them effectively. Any questions not answered through the video: One question I had was why two parallel capacitors are used instead of one. This was answered—one filters low frequency noise, the other high. However, I didn’t fully understand some of the other noise elimination techniques.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u40kX1DYKdA: Decoupling Capacitors - And why they are important"}]}
