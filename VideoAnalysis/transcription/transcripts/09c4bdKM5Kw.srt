1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
In today's video, we're going to be taking a look at an all-new stack from T-Motor.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,320
Now, this is a 20x20 stack that comes with the ESC flight controller.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,360
It is an F7.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,700
It does have a 10-volt regulator, and it does have a direct connection to the DJI setup.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,840
However, just because it's incorporating the DJI setup doesn't mean they've even removed the OSD.

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:25,700
You still have your on-screen display for analog setups if you needed that, which is really, really nice.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,360
So what we're going to cover today is we're going to go ahead and take a look at some of the accessories.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,860
Also, a detailed connection setup guide.

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,580
So with that being said, let's go ahead and get started.

10
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,900
So taking a look at some of the accessories here, you can tell they have a pre-made XT60 made for us,

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,060
which is a 14-gauge wire XT60 right here, which is really nice to see.

12
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:59,060
Also, a baggie with 10 rubber grommets because the ESC and the flight controller incorporate these rubber grommets.

13
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,340
And also some metal screws and some metal nuts as well.

14
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,460
So that's really nice.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,940
You get two extra rubber grommets in case you lose one.

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,080
You do get the ESC with the capacitor pre-installed.

17
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,820
And they are using a Rubicon capacitor here.

18
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,340
This is a 35-volt, 470 microfarad capacitor that's set up right here.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,480
You also obviously do get the flight controller, which is an F7.

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,320
And we get the connector for the DJI setup.

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
This is for the larger DJI modules.

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,480
As you can tell, you just plug that in.

23
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,860
You plug this right in there.

24
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,320
And it routes basically everything for you.

25
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,080
So that's really nice to see here.

26
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,860
And they also give us the connector, which will route our ESC to our flight controller.

27
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,300
Now, there are a lot of options on this flight controller, which we're going to take a look at in a bit here,

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,160
such as pit mode and the 10-volt regulator.

29
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,240
And we also obviously do have an F7 memory.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,380
And yeah, so it's really nice.

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,040
We're going to take a closer look at that in a bit here.

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:59,180
So for the ESC, they went into a kind of a strange design here because the FETs are so tiny.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,940
But they also do have some sort of a heatsink built in within them here to keep them cool.

34
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,960
But I have no idea how these are going to test right here.

35
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:14,020
These are, as I believe, DSHOT 1200, so BLHeli32 ESCs here.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,760
Filtration is somewhat minimal.

37
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,960
But it's really good that they've provided that low-Ease R capacitor.

38
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,820
And if you didn't know how to install this, just a quick heads up.

39
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,120
This should be in the back.

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,840
And you could read motor 1, 2, 3, 4.

41
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,900
Install it just like this in your quadcopter or else it will never fly unless you know what you're doing.

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,880
The camera should be right there in the front.

43
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,680
Same thing with the flight controller here.

44
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,900
Watch that arrow right there.

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,000
The USB should be on top and to the left here.

46
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,520
And this is how it would be set up in your quadcopter.

47
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,180
So now let's go ahead and jump into the advanced breakdown of the flight controller and also the beginner setup guide right after that.

48
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:48,860
All right, guys.

49
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,440
So right now we're going to be doing the advanced breakdown of the T-Motor flight controller here.

50
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,680
So let's go ahead and take a look at it.

51
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
There isn't much going on here.

52
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,380
And it's really nice that they're able to fit all this stuff into one 20 by 20 board here.

53
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,660
So on the left here, we're looking at the top side.

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,860
And as we can tell, we have an on-screen display, which is really nice.

55
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:11,100
And at the same time, we also do have a connector for the DJI setups here, the DJI HD module setups.

56
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,400
And they're using tantalum capacitors for the on-screen display, which is really good.

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,420
Minimizes the chances of lines or your OSD flickering here.

58
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,680
And this seems like a barometer, but I don't think it's a barometer.

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,140
I think it's a 27 megahertz crystal for the on-screen display here.

60
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,560
Here we have our boob button if we ever get stuck.

61
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,840
3.3 volt regulator.

62
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,920
MPU 6000 gyro.

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,280
And here we have two selectable pads, which are very important.

64
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,100
This one not as important.

65
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,680
This is to enable pit mode.

66
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,340
So if you wanted to set that up, which means it'll basically power off your video transmitter.

67
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,740
But you'd have to bridge these in order to enable them in the software.

68
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,420
So you have to keep that in mind.

69
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,760
And for the receiver side, as you can tell, this is meant to be for the receiver side.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,800
We have RSSI.

71
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,120
We have PPM.

72
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,840
I don't know if anybody still uses PPM.

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,100
And we have RX1 and RX2 here.

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,480
These are for the receiver.

75
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,040
However, here's the plus, which is going to be the positive for the receiver and the ground.

76
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:15,980
Now, for the positive side, it's not going to give any power until you actually bridge one of these two here.

77
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,160
So if you wanted 3.3 volt, you'd have to solder these two together.

78
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,060
And if you wanted 5 volt in the middle one with the bottom one here, you'd have to solder those two together.

79
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,640
And that would give the output power to this plus sign right here.

80
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,820
So, for example, let's remove these.

81
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
We wanted 5 volts because most of our receivers nowadays are 5 volts.

82
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,260
Then this pad right here would be 5 volt.

83
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:42,220
And if you didn't bridge these, then you will get no power and you'd be going crazy while your receiver is not turning on.

84
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,540
And that would be the case.

85
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:49,220
We also do have the 10 volt broken out down here and another one broken out right here.

86
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,380
This is camera control.

87
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,500
This is really nice.

88
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,420
You have two 10 volt pads, which you could use.

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,560
You could either use it for your camera if you wanted to.

90
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,320
But I'd recommend you go with that 5 volt.

91
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,080
And if you wanted the 10 volt for your video transmitter, this is the area where you'd want it.

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,800
Because they also have a T3 right there for you for like smart audio or RC TRAM protocol.

93
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,440
That's for the analog setups also.

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,260
And you can tell right here R1 is being set up, also used for the DJI.

95
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,100
So, if you don't have this, if you don't have the controller for the DJI, you want to remove these two right here wires, the last two wires from this connector.

96
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,420
And just worry about T3 and R3, which would be the MSP serial protocol between the DJI module.

97
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,860
So, it can give you the telemetry data, ground, and the power for the DJI module right there.

98
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,680
We still have quite a lot of things going on for it.

99
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,020
And that's currently it for the advanced breakdown.

100
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,740
There isn't really much else to say.

101
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,900
Here we have memory.

102
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,980
Again, it's an F7.

103
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,680
And we have our voltage regulators.

104
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,620
We have two voltage regulators.

105
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,440
We have a 10 volt.

106
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,880
And we have the 5 volt here.

107
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,960
And that's about it for the advanced breakdown.

108
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,340
Let's go ahead and jump into the beginner setup guide here.

109
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,580
Alright guys, so right now we're going to be talking about the FPV camera.

110
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:06,180
Now, most of these cameras take anywhere between 5 volts all the way up to 30 plus volts.

111
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,000
But again, even though it does that, I really recommend you set it up on a 5 volt regulator.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:20,060
Just stick to a 5 volt because this reduces the chances of you getting some weird lines or some weird flickers in your video feed which can be really annoying and hinder your flying performance.

113
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:23,300
So, for example, here it says VCC because it does that.

114
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,800
But we always want to give it just that 5 volts.

115
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,340
It makes things so much better here.

116
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,940
Now, the place where we want to go ahead and set up our 5 volts, there's plenty of places actually where we can do that.

117
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,480
But we can grab our first 5 volt from this right there, right at the edge right there.

118
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,960
And now we'll give our camera 5 volts.

119
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,440
Then we're going to need a ground.

120
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,700
And it's so weird because the ground is this far away right here.

121
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,900
Let's actually use a different color.

122
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,720
We're going to use white for that.

123
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,220
So we're going to grab our ground wire right there.

124
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,060
This is for the camera.

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,960
This is how it was intended to be installed.

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,020
But again, you could change out the layout if you wanted to.

127
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,140
But make sure you get a ground also.

128
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,220
Here's the VI, which means video input.

129
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,880
And that is going to be for your camera right there.

130
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
And that's about it.

131
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,380
This is the video line.

132
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,440
So the camera needs positive and a negative, which are the white and red wires right here.

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,220
And the video is going to be the video signal coming in.

134
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,700
And it goes into the flight control.

135
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,160
Now, why does it go into the flight controller?

136
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:25,020
It's because it goes through this chip right here, which overlays the useful information, such as your battery and many other things as well.

137
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,640
And then it'll output that back out to your video, especially on analog.

138
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,300
And if it's not on analog, it'll go through the UART for the DJI stuff here.

139
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,620
And that's about it for the FPV camera.

140
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,640
Very simple stuff.

141
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,780
Let's go to the next step.

142
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:38,680
Okay.

143
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,960
So in this part of the video, we're going to be talking about how to connect, for example, SBUS.

144
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,540
So SBUS, also IBUS for FlySky, and also the TBS Crossfire.

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,020
So we'll just say TBS.

146
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,240
There we go.

147
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:52,800
TBS.

148
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,980
So we're going to show all these.

149
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:58,520
Now, it's actually going to be pretty identical because this is an F7 flight controller.

150
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,400
And they all go into basically the same place.

151
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,820
So let's get started here.

152
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,060
First of all, we'll start off with just an SBUS.

153
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,380
So we're going to use the green wire here.

154
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,500
So SBUS is supposed to be, or at least when they've designed this, they want you to stick it on R1, which would be RX1 here.

155
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,100
And it'll be very simple for you to follow along with the instructions from the webpage also of how to set this up in Betaflight.

156
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,540
Basically, you just enable serial RX in the ports tab on UART1.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,480
So this is SBUS right here.

158
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,540
Very simple stuff.

159
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,160
Now, how would we connect the IBUS signal?

160
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,220
Then we're going to jump into the power in a little bit here.

161
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:37,600
So an IBUS signal is going to be also the same exact thing.

162
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,100
There's nothing else to do here.

163
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,240
IBUS and SBUS are going to go in the same place.

164
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,140
Now, let's just say we have a TBS crossfire.

165
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,380
We're going to do that down here.

166
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,220
We're just going to call it TBS.

167
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,840
Now, those usually have two pads.

168
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,500
They will have an RX and they will have a TX.

169
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,940
So we're going to say TX right there.

170
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,400
And I'm going to remove this from here.

171
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,720
And we'll just call it down here TBS.

172
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,340
So if you have the TBS crossfire.

173
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,380
Okay.

174
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,960
So what you want to do is you want to grab the TX of your TBS,

175
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,340
the pad that says TX.

176
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,840
And we're just going to do it like that.

177
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,200
And that's going to go exactly in the same place as the SBUS and IBUS.

178
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,820
However, now we have the RX, which this thing will receive data.

179
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,900
That's what the RX stands for.

180
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,760
It's going to receive data.

181
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,460
So we're going to need a transmit pin from the flight controller,

182
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,440
which is usually a T.

183
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,700
And it's right over here.

184
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,120
So we're just going to go ahead and grab that, set that up.

185
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,580
And bam, we're done with the signal wires.

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,180
Now comes the power.

187
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,720
Now the power is usually pretty straightforward.

188
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,360
However, here there is a little extra step that we're going to have to take into consideration,

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,940
which we're going to cover as well.

190
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,020
So first of all, let's start with the power.

191
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,140
So here's the power signal.

192
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,500
You would hopefully know which one's the 5 volt on your receiver here.

193
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,240
And that's where it's going to go, the 5 volt.

194
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,160
And next one over is going to be ground.

195
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,280
We're going to use white here.

196
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,300
And it's right there.

197
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,560
And bam.

198
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,180
There we go.

199
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,100
We'll call this ground ground.

200
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,820
Now, when you set this all up and you boot it up, the thing is, your receiver will not

201
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,520
boot, basically.

202
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,540
Because on the other side of the flight controller, if we actually bring this in and move it somewhere

203
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,400
a little bit nicer.

204
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,140
So sorry about the little messy layout.

205
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,800
But if we look at the backside of the flight controller, there's going to be this little

206
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,560
pad right here.

207
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,320
And I think it's under this right there.

208
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
Yeah, it's by the USB.

209
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,840
So it's on the backside of this section right there.

210
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,800
And what you can see is we can see three pads here.

211
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,320
Now, if you're using any of these three receivers, then what you want to do is you want to add

212
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,780
solder on the middle one and this one.

213
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,100
Connect those two together.

214
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,000
And what that'll do is it'll output 5 volts on this line.

215
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,780
Now, if yours was a 3.3 volt, then you're going to want to do the 3.3 volt with the

216
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,700
middle one right here.

217
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,960
Then this will become 3.3 volts.

218
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,940
However, again, if you're using any of the ones that I have listed down here, you want

219
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,980
to connect the 5 volts.

220
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,340
So we want to connect those two.

221
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,920
And that should be 5 volts.

222
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,980
Then you're good to go.

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,220
And that's about it for this step.

224
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,700
Let's go ahead and jump into the next step.

225
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,040
All right.

226
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,620
So in this part of the video, we are going to be covering the video transmitter.

227
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,700
To be exact, the analog variance.

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,820
Now, the first thing you need to identify, which is very important, is what your video

229
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,000
transmitter takes as a power input.

230
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,860
There's only two in the market, 5 volts and 7 to whatever volts.

231
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,700
We'll just say XX volts.

232
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,300
So you need to identify which one you have here.

233
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,500
We call this the battery voltage video transmitter.

234
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,660
And we'll call this a 5 volt video transmitter.

235
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,960
I'll be showing you both.

236
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,320
First of all, let's start with the battery voltage video transmitter.

237
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,320
And that's going to basically go on the 10 volt right there.

238
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,380
So we're going to go ahead and grab the red wire here.

239
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,440
And we're just going to set that up right over here.

240
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,860
And that is the 10 volts for battery voltage video transmitters.

241
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,480
Now, if yours was the 5 volt, the only difference of the connection set up here is only going

242
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,560
to be this red wire.

243
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,060
So if you had the 5 volt version, then you're going to want to set up the red wire right there

244
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,940
for your 5 volt.

245
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,840
So again, this is the only difference between those two video transmitters.

246
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,000
The battery voltage video transmitter will go on the 10 volt and your 5 volt will go on

247
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,520
this 5 volt.

248
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,000
We can't use this one because we used this for the camera earlier.

249
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,880
And that's about it here.

250
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,140
So now we need ground.

251
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,480
So always the power.

252
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,560
I always recommend setting up the power first.

253
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,960
So we're going to go ahead and grab ground.

254
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:26,880
And we could basically grab ground from anywhere, any of those G pads.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,680
But we'll just take it from here because it's right next to it.

256
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,880
And it's just going to make everything so much more simple.

257
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,600
Now, the next thing we need is the video line, which is usually the yellow wire here.

258
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,800
So let's go ahead and grab that real quick.

259
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,160
And that's going to go into VO.

260
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,780
So we're going to have to cross over here.

261
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,900
And we're going to go right there.

262
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,380
This is video output.

263
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,420
And because the camera comes in on a video input, it goes through here, goes through

264
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:49,900
this chip.

265
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,080
This chip puts all the useful information and then spits it back out to the video transmitter

266
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,160
right over here.

267
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,120
And you'll be able to get that nice telemetry data that you want.

268
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:04,900
So now we're left with one more wire, usually sometimes three more wires, which would be

269
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,100
another black and a red one, which would say 5 volt.

270
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,620
But be careful because that's a 5 volt output.

271
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,540
And you want to completely ignore that.

272
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,040
Those are usually used for RC wings where they don't have a flight controller and the video

273
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,420
transmitter usually powers on the camera.

274
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,600
So you want to ignore those.

275
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,300
But there is one little extra one that's going to be the, for example, smart, they call it

276
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,960
smart audio or the IRC tram protocol.

277
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,800
And usually it would be green or purple or something of that nature.

278
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,600
And the place where you want to set this wire up is going to be, so it's going to be right

279
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
here on T3.

280
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,800
So this is a TX3.

281
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,320
And now it's going to be the place where you set up your ports tab.

282
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,920
You go under UART3 peripherals and you choose whether you have smart audio, video transmitter

283
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,780
or IRC.

284
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,520
And that's found in the documentation.

285
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,400
I think this one right here was smart audio protocol.

286
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,720
And this will allow you to change the channel and output power through the onscreen display

287
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,960
instead of having to come here and play around with the button and start changing stuff.

288
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,600
So yeah, that's the only thing.

289
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,940
You really don't need to connect it.

290
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,160
But if you do connect it, it makes your life a little bit easier.

291
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,980
And with that being said, that's about it for this video, guys.

292
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,260
