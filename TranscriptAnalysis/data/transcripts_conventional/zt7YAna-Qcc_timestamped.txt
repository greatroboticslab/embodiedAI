[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:20.840] Today's project is a little kit from the usual sources and it's the LM1875T. Now this isn't a
[00:00:20.840 → 00:00:30.680] new chip from by any stretch of the imagination it's been around since 2011. It's actually a pretty
[00:00:30.680 → 00:00:43.700] good chip. It produces about 20 watts per channel or a little bit more into 4 ohms. Now I don't want
[00:00:43.700 → 00:00:50.760] to give away what I've found on this but it's worth watching till the end of the video because
[00:00:50.760 → 00:01:00.080] there's a few surprises in store. So let's get on with the tests. It's on the bench now and we're
[00:01:00.080 → 00:01:10.120] connected to a positive and negative supply of 25 volts. This shows the quiescent conditions.
[00:01:10.920 → 00:01:19.580] There's no signal going in at present and it's consuming half a watt of power from both supplies.
[00:01:19.580 → 00:01:27.860] This is the negative supply and this is the positive supply. Now the first test I'm going to do is to
[00:01:27.860 → 00:01:41.420] power it up and see the maximum power that we can get done in my usual way just prior to clipping
[00:01:41.420 → 00:01:49.540] with one kilohertz going in. There is only one channel because it's mono. I haven't built the other
[00:01:49.540 → 00:01:59.300] one yet. So we'll see what power we get. Now bearing in mind this is a stabilized supply so the power will
[00:01:59.300 → 00:02:09.480] remain at 25 volts no matter how much power I draw. Obviously if you built this using a standard
[00:02:09.480 → 00:02:20.600] analog supply for want of a better word you may well start off with 25 volts but that will sag down to 22 23
[00:02:20.600 → 00:02:28.600] depending on the power supply you build. So obviously you will not get the maximum power
[00:02:28.600 → 00:02:38.040] power under those conditions. So whatever we measure now is with a stabilized supply of 25 volts.
[00:02:39.000 → 00:02:49.720] Now clearly this little heat sink is not going to provide adequate cooling. Probably on music it might be okay
[00:02:49.720 → 00:03:02.200] but I'm going to use this little fan because I don't really want it to go bang. I'm sure that's going to be adequate for the job in question.
[00:03:02.200 → 00:03:07.720] Right we're going to wind up the input now until we just
[00:03:10.360 → 00:03:11.880] our below clip
[00:03:17.080 → 00:03:24.360] and that's there and we're looking at the 30 volt scale which is this one
[00:03:24.360 → 00:03:41.240] which means we've got 14 volts RMS. 14 volts times 14 volts equals divided by 8 because we've got an 8 ohm load
[00:03:42.120 → 00:03:54.200] that's 24.5 watts. Well I started to do the same test into 4 ohms and it doesn't like 4 ohms. Look
[00:03:54.200 → 00:04:05.480] it starts to do some horrible things. I'm going to reduce the voltage down to 20 volts
[00:04:07.880 → 00:04:10.680] and see if it's happier. Let's have a look.
[00:04:14.360 → 00:04:15.160] Yes it is.
[00:04:15.160 → 00:04:33.240] So it doesn't like there's the maximum power and we've got 9 volts. Yes 20 watts. It doesn't really like 4 ohms.
[00:04:33.880 → 00:04:36.440] Well we have a bit of a dilemma now.
[00:04:36.440 → 00:04:46.840] The rating of this amplifier if you look at the official specifications is 20 watts into 4 ohms
[00:04:47.800 → 00:04:55.800] and 25 watts into 8 ohms. So clearly it has a bit of an issue with lower impedances.
[00:04:56.760 → 00:05:04.520] It says that's both with 25 volts and you can operate it at up to plus and minus 30 volts
[00:05:04.520 → 00:05:11.160] and you can operate it at up to plus and minus 30 volts. What I'm going to do is I suspect you'll be
[00:05:11.160 → 00:05:22.040] surprised to hear this but we may well have a fake chip. I know what you're saying you find that so hard to
[00:05:22.040 → 00:05:31.320] believe but I think it could be the case. So I'm going to pause the video here now and pop down to
[00:05:31.320 → 00:05:43.800] J-Car and purchase a proper one and the one that I've still got to build here which I've actually built
[00:05:44.760 → 00:05:54.920] but I haven't put the chip on it yet so I'm going to pop out now and buy a proper chip put that on there
[00:05:54.920 → 00:06:04.040] and see if it makes any difference and if I find that the chip is fake I should be looking for a refund.
[00:06:05.320 → 00:06:15.720] Well I've returned from shopping at J-Car and here we have the fake maybe and here we have
[00:06:15.720 → 00:06:27.160] the genuine maybe you can see they do look different this one the supposedly good one has just got a little
[00:06:27.800 → 00:06:39.960] round circle etched into it and the fake maybe has the sides beveled again from the rear they do look
[00:06:39.960 → 00:06:48.760] noticeably different. Now sadly the fakes don't always come with a red or in this case a black blob
[00:06:48.760 → 00:06:56.360] on them but that's just so if I drop them on the floor or can't remember which one's which this one
[00:06:56.920 → 00:07:02.920] is the one that came with the kit. If only all the fakes came with a blob of some colour on there that
[00:07:02.920 → 00:07:12.040] would make life easier wouldn't it. Even the leads have a different pitch slightly to the potentially
[00:07:12.040 → 00:07:20.600] good one. Anyway that's enough waffle I'm going to assemble this good one into the board and we'll see
[00:07:20.600 → 00:07:29.880] if there's any difference at all. I have exactly the same setup that I did for the original chip except
[00:07:29.880 → 00:07:36.040] I've mounted it on a bigger heat sink purely so I don't have to have a fan running on it. Other
[00:07:36.040 → 00:07:43.080] than that the setup is the same I've got a couple of extra capacitors here purely because my leads are
[00:07:43.080 → 00:07:51.000] a couple of feet long in reality I don't think it's going to make any difference but I wanted the test to
[00:07:51.000 → 00:07:59.560] be identical to the previous tests. The first thing we notice is that the quiescent current is now
[00:07:59.560 → 00:08:09.800] 30 milliamps and instead of 20 milliamps and the conditions are otherwise the same. Voltage is the same
[00:08:09.800 → 00:08:18.120] 25 volts plus and minus. Right we have our 8 ohm load connected and you can see on the scope we're
[00:08:18.120 → 00:08:25.720] actually running this at 100 hertz and the reason for doing that is because when I did the previous
[00:08:25.720 → 00:08:34.520] tests on the original chip I also had it set to 100 hertz not 1 kilohertz as I said so to keep things
[00:08:34.520 → 00:08:41.800] similar it won't make any difference in reality and I've already checked this and the power is the same
[00:08:41.800 → 00:08:50.200] at 100 ohms at 100 hertz as it is at 1 kilohertz. So we'll wind up the power now look at the top of the
[00:08:50.200 → 00:09:03.400] waveform and there's clipping there there so we take it down to there if we look at the meter on this scale
[00:09:04.440 → 00:09:18.920] we have 15 volts now according to my Olivetti meter that gives us 28.1 we'll call it 13 watts which is
[00:09:18.920 → 00:09:27.720] already 4 watts more than the previous chip under exactly the same circumstances so we'll do the same
[00:09:27.720 → 00:09:38.920] test now into 4 ohms. So there we have clean power and the heat sink is getting really toasty let's look at the
[00:09:38.920 → 00:09:57.880] power we've got 12 volts into 4 ohms. 12 volts into 4 ohms gives 36 watts which is a bit of an improvement
[00:09:57.880 → 00:10:10.200] from the previous which gave us 19 watts so I think we can categorically say that the chips supplied with the kit
[00:10:11.560 → 00:10:12.280] are fake
[00:10:14.760 → 00:10:23.800] this is our square wave at 1 kilohertz it really is 1 kilohertz now not 100 and as you can see it's pretty
[00:10:23.800 → 00:10:36.040] respectable let's um open it up a bit not bad at all not bad at all this is 10 kilohertz again as i've
[00:10:36.040 → 00:10:42.360] mentioned before excuse all the muck on here it's coming from some something in this room and i don't
[00:10:42.360 → 00:10:50.120] know what it is because even if i leave the scope unconnected i get that and it's definitely not coming
[00:10:50.120 → 00:10:56.120] from the amplifier itself i don't propose to spend hours going through graphs and things i should
[00:10:56.120 → 00:11:01.880] give you some figures shortly but we'll just go up a little bit to 20 kilohertz and see what the square
[00:11:01.880 → 00:11:07.000] wave looks like and there we are 20 kilohertz
[00:11:07.000 → 00:11:20.680] wave. Not bad not bad at all in fact it puts the waveforms of the quad which i'd previously tested to shame
[00:11:23.960 → 00:11:31.640] I'm embarrassed to say but it it really does! Here we are looking at a sign wave obviously and I just
[00:11:31.640 → 00:11:36.920] want you to see how clean it looks there's no crossover artifacts or anything
[00:11:36.920 → 00:11:47.260] nasty and but that corresponds to a hundred milliwatts output but at 50
[00:11:47.260 → 00:11:53.760] kilohertz can you believe pretty impressive by any standards I think we
[00:11:53.760 → 00:12:02.060] can categorically say without any fear of contradiction that the chips supplied
[00:12:02.060 → 00:12:13.560] with the original kits are fakes faulty not good the kits themselves were very
[00:12:13.560 → 00:12:18.240] easy to put together and all the components other than the chips which is
[00:12:18.240 → 00:12:23.320] sad because that's the main part of it are fine printed circuit board has good
[00:12:23.320 → 00:12:31.440] earthing planes and it is good one of the kits were missing to 15 pq
[00:12:31.440 → 00:12:38.680] was it 15 I can't remember but we're missing two small ceramic capacitors
[00:12:38.680 → 00:12:47.160] should you buy it well if you buy it and use it as is it's sort of okay into 8
[00:12:47.160 → 00:12:56.460] ohms and you get a reasonable power but bearing in mind that if you buy a genuine
[00:12:56.460 → 00:13:03.780] chip and this should be the giveaway you can expect to pay about 11 New Zealand
[00:13:03.780 → 00:13:09.700] dollars per chip which is more than the price of the kit but that's the price you
[00:13:09.700 → 00:13:15.820] pay if you want something genuine which is actually a pretty good amplifier I have
[00:13:15.820 → 00:13:28.140] to say it it really does sound good and if you want a 25 watt or more into 4 ohms then this this is a pretty good
[00:13:28.140 → 00:13:40.820] little kit even if you throw the chip away and you couldn't make the printed circuit board or buy the extra components for what you pay so I guess that's what you have to consider
[00:13:40.820 → 00:13:47.360] buy the kits throw the chip away and go to your do a proper electronic
[00:13:47.360 → 00:13:53.780] distributor RS components Farnell or other ones which are probably more
[00:13:53.780 → 00:14:01.940] prominent to you in your country and you do get a very nice little amplifier but
[00:14:01.940 → 00:14:13.100] these are the figures on the proper chip half DB down okay 10 Hertz and on the
[00:14:13.100 → 00:14:21.860] high side 55 kilohertz but if you want to really slum it and have 1 DB down pretty
[00:14:21.860 → 00:14:39.100] dreadful 7 Hertz and 105 kilohertz so not not a bad spec I think you'll agree the low end of course does have a 1 microfarad
[00:14:39.100 → 00:14:51.260] capacitor on the input electrolytic and you could argue that you'd be better off replacing that with a polyester or something like that but
[00:14:51.260 → 00:15:01.660] and if you put the component to a 2.2 microfarad you will go down even lower but in all honesty
[00:15:02.460 → 00:15:14.060] um 10 Hertz half a DB down it's not tacky is it I mean it would shame many valve well all am all valve amplifiers
[00:15:14.060 → 00:15:21.500] so I wouldn't I wouldn't mess with it it is what it is and for what you pay even if you go out and purchase
[00:15:21.500 → 00:15:34.140] two proper genuine chips you'll have a very nice 25 watt into 8 or 35 watts into 4 not tacky by any means
[00:15:34.140 → 00:15:41.420] yeah
[00:15:41.420 → 00:15:41.580] yeah
[00:15:41.580 → 00:15:42.420] yeah
[00:15:42.420 → 00:15:43.440] yeah
[00:15:43.440 → 00:15:44.460] yeah
[00:15:44.460 → 00:15:45.600] yeah
[00:15:45.600 → 00:15:46.860] yeah
[00:15:46.860 → 00:15:50.500] yeah
[00:15:54.020 → 00:15:55.020] yeah
