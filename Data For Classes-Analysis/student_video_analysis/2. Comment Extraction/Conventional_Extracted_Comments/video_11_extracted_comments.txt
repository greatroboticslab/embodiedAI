Thanks for the video! The mallu accent brought back so many memories from Amrita University!

Its so easy to understand. Thanks for the help

Thank you! Doing research for a book with a robotic main character, and now I know how to label some of the parts she's build with

Are there alternative place to buy robotic parts (wheels, suspensions, chassis, arms, small parts) OTHER THAN sparkfun, microcenter, digikey, or adafruit?

Please work on  reducing the accent. I can’t watch the tutorials because it’s very difficult to pick up on you tying your words together and rolling so many sounds. Try be clearer for English speakers. I have to get off the video

this channel is a life saver, working on a very specific project where I know what to do but because I'm learning on the go I don't know the terminology to look for/order the parts I need, thank you so much :)

Thank you ❤
