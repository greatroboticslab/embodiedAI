Very helpful. Thank you! Please post more in-depth videos.

Would something like an H-drive work better than swerve for a team with limited experience with programming? I know swerve can be complicated, and my team is pretty set on abandoning the tank drive after building an Everybot this year (2023).

Can I get the slide of this video?

if you're really wanting to be able to strafe but not do swerve, I would recommend mecanum drive over H drive. However, I do not recommend mecanum drive. Go with tank or make the leap to swerve, imo.

sorry this is late but if you use a swerve library (sds, ect) you baraly have to do any hard programming
