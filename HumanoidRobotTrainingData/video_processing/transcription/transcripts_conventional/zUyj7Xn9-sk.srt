00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,680
In this RLC circuit with op-amp, we are going to determine system voltage gain at

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:18,040
frequency of 1 MHz. In this example, we will disregard the effect of phase change on the output.

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:59,980
Thank you.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,980
Thank you.

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:59,980
Thank you.
