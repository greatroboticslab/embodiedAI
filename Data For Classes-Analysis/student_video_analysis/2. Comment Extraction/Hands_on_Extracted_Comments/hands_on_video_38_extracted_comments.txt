no. this design is for mg995 servo. 3d parts available for sg90 please check online

Please make special video on this robot

Bro. Well done . But some code nd design link can't reach the site. How I fix it. U r genius😘😘🥰🥰🥰.

Who is malcolm green

Can I use any servo motor or only the mg995 that you showed?

How much cost bro...?

which sheet have you used for it how much mm

Hats off bro I really appreciate you but your subscribers are less you deserve more

Do you used mg 995 servo 360° Or 180°  Please tell me

Sir can u suggest any other motor which we can use in the robot please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

It works with the small servo motor blue colour

Sir ,can you tell me the torque value of the motor used in this project.  Stall torque :- 12 kg/cm. Or 15 kg/ cm or any other value,plzz reply🙏🙏🙏

I have yoused sg90 sevro moter it works for robots

Sir, can  you give me the circuit diagram and the code of humanoid robot.Thank you.

Who many mm iron sheath

Thanks for you work! You are a geniuss !!!

Bro. Can i use  sg90 servo? Or arduino uno for this.??

Hello sir, I made a Talking Robot from Aurduino Uno and many other projects and lecture on robotics Please check my work 🙏

Yes, the design is for mg995 or mg996 only.if you use any other servo you need to change the design accordingly

Ok thanks sir

I have used less than 1mm light weight iron sheet

I used 180 degree servo

No it won't.i designed it for MG995 servo

12 is enough, but u have money buy 15kg

What material is this torque I didn’t see it in the materials listed thanks for your quick response

​​ @RAJTECHTAMIL an I use a 90 s servo motor????

@khabil_Blat  no. Because of lode is high so SG 90 is can't lift this lode. Mg995 is have 15kg lifting capacity.

@RAJTECHTAMIL  ​@RAJTECHTAMIL Thanks for all the replies, can I ask one last question? Can I put Mator mg 995 only on the legs 90c put on the arms?

Hello sir, I made a Talking Robot from Aurduino Uno and many other projects and lecture on robotics Please check my work 🙏

I spent 9k approximately

thank you

i have used mini drill

90s servo motor can be used?

available in the description please check

To @HashRobotics  thank you sir.

He helped you you should subscribe bro

1mm light weight iron sheet.

thanks keep supporting

@HashRobotics  reds

@HashRobotics Robotics: That does not look like a humanoid Robot, that it a robot do you even know how to create one? To make things better for you maybe your best bet is that you can buy a 3D printer to scan all of your body parts and then try to create a biotic part out of human flesh.

Daniel you are correct but it will be costly and everyone  does not have 3d printer if they want to make this  in home and steel is harder than 3d printed material  Good job liked your project   even I am making the same robot. 🙂🙂

No.this design is for mg995 servo.you can use uno but you may need PCA9685 servo drive

How to cut inside part for servo please answer

Are you engineer

Is MG995 of 180,270 or 360 ? Can we use MG945, MG946R or MG996R too ?

suparrrrrr

sir can sg90 servo motor will work in this robot if I use cardboard at the place of metal?????? Please answer me please🙏🙏😭🙏🙏

Sir can i use 180 degree rotation mg995 servo motor????????please answer my question

How to make a ball and socket join in arm

Sir, r u using revet guns for installing revets?

Thanks sir this robort curcuit diagrams send pls

What sheet to make the robort

How you made the hole for servo(r7mm) and horn(r4mm)??🙏

What's the degree of the motor? 180 or 360 rotation?

Bro can send the buying links of products plzzz

Plz keep going

I love your robot bro I think I will also make it

Anna endhi EEEE smallround  black part of robot adhi endi

I have used mini grinding tool

I know why you didn't show because it is your monopoly thanks for reply and keep creating

yes

MG995  180 degree. when compared to other servo MG995 have good torque

Sg90 servos would work in a quadrapud configuration, like humanoids but you can use balsa wood to build the frame , it's lighter and has more strength....compared to cardboard. Cardboard doesn't just works out...

Yes I have used 180 degree mg995 servo

@HashRobotics  sir can sg90 servo motor will work in this robot if I use cardboard at the place of metal?????? Please answer me please🙏🙏😭🙏🙏

Hello sir, I made a Talking Robot from Aurduino Uno and many other projects and lecture on robotics Please check my work 🙏 Please support me Also , I will try to give Best content

With arduino it is difficult. I'm learning python. We'll make it soon

Anything with light weight.i have used 1mm iron sheet

i have used mini drilling machine

@HashRobotics  thanks for your rply sir🙏 I have a mini drill but these bits are not fit for it.. Can you please share link of your drill and bit?🙏

180 degree

@HashRobotics  thanks a lot.... 😉

Any buying website recommendations?

@vishnukuppuswamy8153 try amazon or robu

can i buy  from this website ???????

@vishnukuppuswamy8153  first try from the local market then if you don't get any component then buy from online

@HashRobotics  tried the cost is too high.... Tried in majestic robotic shop

@vishnukuppuswamy8153  I have bought the servo from there only. If you are buying large quantity they will give discounts

@HashRobotics  bro can i know for which price did you bought? Please...

@vishnukuppuswamy8153  Please DM in Instagram

Sir can I use Arduino Uno instead of Arduino mega

9K Approximately

I made it

How ?

Hi, you are from Nigeria

Price may vary... I bought for 350 per motor

Thanks

Servo motor

If we use wheels we can use dc motor. For this kind of robot servo or stepper motor is mandatory

Sir please make video on this robot

I have used light weight  metal sheet.

No, it is metal sheet

Thanks, keep supporting

yes you can use. but you cannot able to connect that many servos. For that, you need PCA9685 PWM servo control board

Guy can I use sg90 9gram servo motor I the place of mg996 servo motor

Super

Can you suggest me some other material for making a robot...

can we make this robot with MDF or Acrylic

Sir 7:24 what is the name of the part plz provide it's buying link mettal rubber??

Sir where is the code...

Where will i get the goods and will be make up to 800

Sir size is not mentioned in template sir how to make it perfect sized

Sir can I do with Arduino Uno with same code and prosidures

Sir if I use cardboard box then I want to use fevi quick to stick  or other things

Sir can use cardboard box for making body

Ser can you tell me which servo I get in 100 rupees per can you tell me please

Sir we use 4mm sunbourd sheet

hi you are robot is nice

Isn't it very difficult to make

Sir power of pro mg90s matel gear servo and mg995 servo motor is same

Please help sir.The design pdf link is expired.There's no file insidr the link.

Can we get the parts online

I love this Creativity... I am also making robot on my second channel..on Smart Creativity #smartcrestivity

HI BRO , I AM GOING TO MAKE THIS ROBOT FOR LERNING AND CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME ABOUT THE  THICKNESS OF  THE  IRON METAL SHEET \

You can use. You should design accordingly

You can use foam board but I cannot withstand that much weight.you can try without legs

I don't think the servo will lift that much weight. You may need higher torque servo. You can try hands part alone.

With mdf??

Mdf board will workk

That is servo horn. That comes with MG995 servo motor. And metal revert also comes along with servo motor

Thxx

Please refer part 2 and part 3 video description

Thxx

If we want to make it without arduino mega just with the normal arduino and only legs what to do??

@archanasilmana9852  you can use PCA9685 pwm servo motor drive. In a single board you can able to connect upto 16 servo motors.Video available please check in my channel

English please

Please refer video for dimensions

Yes can. Just follow the steps

@HashRobotics  where is that matirial of body available sir

@gameradhi7275  that you have to make..design diagram available please check

Yeah you can use feviquick. Don't add too much weight .

Ofcourse yes.but you should design accordingly.

@HashRobotics  sir how I design can you tell me sir

@skgirlsblocks8802  Hi, you don't have to do exactly like this. Just get the concept and try your own design. If you have any difficulties feel free to ask

For starting you can make without legs. Instead of legs you can add wheels

@HashRobotics  sir can you give your email id if i have any problem then i ask

i am small boy i dont have money but i like to make robot thats why i am asking you many thing i have only 4000 rupees

@skgirlsblocks8802  Please follow the official Instagram page

@HashRobotics  ok

Reply sir

You can get sg 90 micro servo.it have low torque you should design accordingly

Yes you can. But don't add too much weight

Sir plz make avideo with rdunio code setup plz plz

@the_lord_of_binary  please check part 2 and part 3

Thanks and keep supporting

You can try without leg part.instead of legs you can use wheels

It's not the same MG995 has a higher torque

please check now

@HashRobotics  What should be the paper size when I print out the diagram to get the perfect size according to your size? plz reply

@shakilahmed6870  you should take dimensions from video

@HashRobotics  Sir you could share the apk link with us.I checked the description of all videos.I couldn’t find the app link.😭😭😭

@shakilahmed6870  I have made a separate video on how to make an app.please check on my channel

Less than 1mm.. Try light weight sheet .if you add more weight it will difficult

@HashRobotics  ok bro and what is thename of the metal rivet

@saivignessramasamy7248  the metal rivet comes with MG995 servo motor. you don't have to buy separately

Can you show me diagram of how you connect the wires of servo please make video on YouTube☺☺

Very nice project and very good teaching style .. May u please provide a PDF of parts drawings with dimensions .. thanks very much ..

Bro can u release the plans for these?

Nice

Its already available in part 2 video. Please check

Reply sir

Yes you can make. You should design accordingly. Don't add too much weight

Reply sir

Reply sir please sir

No it's not same.both different in size

@HashRobotics  ok sir can you make robot with mini servo and with sun board sheet please sir please sir

You should design accordingly for micro servo.plese get the idea from video and try

Reply sir

Hi..you need to design according to mini servo. The design should be simple and light weight .if weight increases you can't make a perfect robot. Because mini servo have less torque

@HashRobotics  sir I am using sunbourd sheet then how tick sheet I want to use 3mm ,4 mm or 5 mm with mini servo moter

@skgirlsblocks8802  3mm would be nice.try to reduce the weight as much as possible

@HashRobotics  thank you sir but I am using micro servo it's ok or not 1mor Question if I use 3 mm sundoard robot will stand properly

Yes you can use

@HashRobotics  thank you sir but with mini servo motor robot also small size

@HashRobotics  sir I am using sunbourd sheet then how tick sheet I want to use 3mm ,4 mm or 5 mm
