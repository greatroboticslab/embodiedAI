[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:11.740] The FlySky FSIA6B receiver has three types of communication protocols, the classic PWM, and two serial protocols, PPM and IBIS.
[00:00:12.460 → 00:00:19.560] When this receiver is connected to a flight controller, one of the two serial connections is always used.
[00:00:19.560 → 00:00:27.700] The flight controllers have so-called UART serial ports, where one line is used to receive information from the radio,
[00:00:27.700 → 00:00:33.020] and another line is used to send information from the controller to the radio.
[00:00:33.840 → 00:00:39.740] The first is called the RX line, and the second is called the TX line, or telemetry.
[00:00:40.580 → 00:00:45.280] The PPM connection is located in the first vertical slot of the receiver.
[00:00:45.760 → 00:00:52.460] The upper pin is used to send the information to the controller, and the lower two to supply power to the receiver.
[00:00:52.460 → 00:00:58.440] If we are going to use this protocol, it must be previously activated in the radio.
[00:00:59.380 → 00:01:04.280] The RX line by IBIS protocol is in the horizontal slot on the right.
[00:01:05.060 → 00:01:11.860] The rightmost pin is used to send information to the controller, and the other two pins are used to power the receiver.
[00:01:12.720 → 00:01:16.520] The sending line is connected to some RX pin of the controller.
[00:01:16.520 → 00:01:22.400] The TX line by IBIS protocol is in the horizontal slot on the left.
[00:01:23.200 → 00:01:30.660] The rightmost pin is used to receive information from the controller, and must be connected to some TX pin of the controller.
[00:01:31.540 → 00:01:34.220] The other two pins are used to power the sensors.
[00:01:34.940 → 00:01:39.140] Since the controller is already powered, these power pins are not used.
[00:01:39.140 → 00:01:46.800] In the following example, we send information to the controller through a RX line by the PPM protocol.
[00:01:47.760 → 00:01:53.400] In addition, we receive information from the controller through a TX line by IBIS.
[00:01:54.120 → 00:01:59.460] In the iNAB configurator, the communications for the UART ports are configured.
[00:02:00.020 → 00:02:04.820] We use UART2 for the TX line, and UART3 for the RX line.
[00:02:04.820 → 00:02:09.460] We see that the radio sends information of the channel to the controller.
[00:02:10.240 → 00:02:16.040] In addition, we see that the radio receives information from some sensors of this controller.
[00:02:16.820 → 00:02:17.780] And that is all.
[00:02:18.000 → 00:02:18.640] Thank you.
[00:02:18.640 → 00:02:18.700] Thank you.
