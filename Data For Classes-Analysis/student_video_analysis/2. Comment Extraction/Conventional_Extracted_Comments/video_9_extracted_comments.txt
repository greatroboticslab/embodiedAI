Whats the name of the movie? Also missed the lift equation for the propellers, moment of inertia and angular velocity

NYC ❤❤

Although kf and km can be derived by one who understands physics, you should have defined them for completeness of your material. Thank you for posting the video anyway.

Useless theoryes !

what is Kf or Km ?

Good

Ur explanation is gr8,but that movie clip is not. Everyone knows what happened after that scene.

bhai hindi mey bolley yarr

nice video

Thanks for posting. This is a much more helpful introduction to quadcopter dynamics than the last one I watched.

Please work on your accent just a little bit......

Clockhwise dirrection and Counterrclockhwise direction 😁😁😁

That's all good in your video but, try to use some technical word, mi= moment of inertia & etc.

What are u saying

you can give me Simulink simulation files abrantesantonio111@gmail.com

Please, no more of that music... It's distracting and it sucks

can you tell me about the propeller working

my group in my class is building a drone

Can you help me with more information about the dinamic model_? plis

Can you share the presentation, please? Thank you!

The video is not about what happened after that movie clip at all.

yeah, speak in a constant flow, otherwise the video is good

Dudeee now I cant focus on anything other than the music.....:/

Supreme Master21 glad to hear that. All the best for ur future endeavors.

Have a look at "Aerial robotics" course  by Vijay Kumar on cousera

Saurabh Lanje 16210090 yes i was about to mention it. 😊

Rafa Carbonell Sorry as for now we can't provide you with the presentation. But for reference purpose i recommend you to see 'Aerial Robotics' on Coursera. 😊

what is the name of the movie at the beginning?

Cheyenne Forbes  " 3 Idiots " . You should watch the movie . It surely will change your views !!!
