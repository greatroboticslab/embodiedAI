And those were all in all the basic components required for an FPV drone\nand I started my component hunt by firstly looking for a frame. The reason is that depending on whether\nyou choose a small or big frame all the other components have to be smaller or bigger too.\nAnd honestly speaking I didn't feel like buying a pre-made frame because when 3D printing a frame\nyou can always easily replace parts and by using PETG filament you also get reasonably strong parts\nwhich eventually though can also break.

The reason is that they often come with low quality bearings so he instead recommended this\nmotor in combination with a 4S battery. With the given kV rating using a 4S battery should give me an\naverage RPM of 37,814 which is above the RPM thrust graph I created in a previous video and thus it should\neasily lift 500g meaning 4 of them should be able to do 2kg which I thought was more than enough.\nAnd by the way I would highly recommend checking out the video I just mentioned because it shows you\nvery well how battery, ESC, motor and propeller interplay with one another.\nBut anyway the datasheet of the motor also stated that even with only 50% thrust it is capable of",

Next for the propellers I was advised to get 6 inch\nones but once I saw how close they get to the drone maybe turning it into drone goulash I instead went with generic 5 inch ones.\nFor the battery like I said before I went with a 4S one with a capacity of 2.2Ah and most importantly a\nhigh C rating which basically says that it can output a high current and thus a high power which is more than\nenough to enjoy the maximum power of all 4 motors. Moving on, next was the receiver and remote part\nand for that I wanted to reuse the remote from my beginners drone kit. Luckily it apparently comes\nwith the ELRS communication protocol that can be used for modern drones. As a comparison back in the old\ndays all your drone remote inputs would alter one data channel at the receiver which is basically a standard\nservo signal. But since dealing with so many data channels is just confusing, modern remotes and\nreceivers just talk to the flight controller through a receive and transmit line and thus we reduced for",
