I got an email from\na visitor who was having all kinds of problems using one of my circuits when he connected\nMOSFETs in parallel. The question became with RG. RG is used with these MOSFETs to bleed off any static\ncharge and thus enabling the MOSFET to cut completely off. Using them for one MOSFET is fine. I was using\na value of 10k. That could of course be lowered. Here I'm going to explain the problems you're going",
