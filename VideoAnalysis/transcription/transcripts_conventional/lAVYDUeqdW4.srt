00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now back to the quadrotor dynamics. The equations at the bottom tell us the net force and the

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
net moment. If we combine the net force and the net moment with the Newton-Euler equations,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
we get these two sets of equations. On the right side, you see the total thrust, which

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:32,000
is U1, and remember this thrust vector is known in the body fixed frame. The matrix R is rotating

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this thrust vector to an inertial frame. At the bottom, you see the net moment, also known

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in the body fixed frame. But the equations, as they've been written, have components in the

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
inertial frame on the top and in a body fixed frame at the bottom. These are the Newton-Euler

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
equations, and these are the equations we'll use to develop controllers and planners for our vehicles.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
One question you can ask is how we actually calculate these parameters? Or in an online setting,

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
how do we estimate these parameters? If you think carefully, the parameters you really need to know are those

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
corresponding to the geometry, the length L, for example, and those corresponding to the physical properties,

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:44,000
the mass M and the inertia I. You can also see that these parameters appear linearly in these equations.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So if you had a system that allowed you to measure positions, velocities, and accelerations,

14
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
it's actually not too hard to estimate the lengths, the masses, and the inertias.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You should also verify that it's quite easy to calculate the angular velocity in the body fixed frame.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you know the pitch, roll, and yaw angles, and you know the rate of change of the pitch, roll, and yaw angles on the right side,

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
a simple transformation yields the angular velocity components p, q, and r along b1, b2, and b3.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So this model is quite complicated. It involves three components of position, velocity, and acceleration,

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
three components of rotations, angular velocities, and angular accelerations.

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:45,000
To get a feel for the control problem, I'd like to first look at the planar version of this model.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So we'll look at the equations of motion in the yz plane. We will assume that the robot cannot move out of this plane.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In other words, there's no motion in the x direction. And we'll also assume there is no yaw or pitch motions.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:20,000
As a result, we come up with the three equations that you see here. Equations that describe the rates of change of velocity in the y and the z direction,

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and the rate of change of the angular velocity in the roll direction.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So we'll look at the same equation. To describe these kinds of systems, it is useful to define a state vector.

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In the three-dimensional case, we have six variables that describe the configuration of a robot,

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and a state vector includes the configuration and its derivative.

28
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the configuration vector is a state vector. So if q is the six-dimensional configuration vector,

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
q and q dot constitute a 12-dimensional description of the state.

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The space of all such state vectors is called a state space.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you look at the equilibrium configuration,

32
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and that configuration is defined by the position x0, y0, and z0,

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the configuration by definition also has a zero roll angle and a zero pitch angle.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It could, of course, have any yaw angle.

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The equilibrium configuration must also correspond to zero velocity.

36
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If I write it down in terms of a state space vector,

37
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
you have the equilibrium configuration q sub e,

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
and you have a zero velocity vector,

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and that gives you a 12-dimensional vector where the bottom six elements are all zero.

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Similarly, for planar quadrotors,

41
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
you have a three-dimensional configuration space,

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
a six-dimensional state space,

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and an equilibrium configuration and an equilibrium state that can be similarly defined.

44
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
thaticionад quadrotors,

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you have one city called the tests and the president's

46
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
as federally defined.
