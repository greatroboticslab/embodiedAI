[00:00:00.640 → 00:00:04.480] What is up everybody, Dac here, and today I'm going to be talking about how to choose the
[00:00:04.480 → 00:00:09.440] right port size for a speaker enclosure and problems associated with ports which are either
[00:00:09.440 → 00:00:14.080] too small or too big. So first off, if you've ever tried to design a sub box you may have
[00:00:14.080 → 00:00:19.760] used WinISD. You can see here that even though the port sizes are vastly different, they seem
[00:00:19.760 → 00:00:23.840] to have the same response curve, but of course one port's got to be better than the other.
[00:00:24.400 → 00:00:31.760] So which is the best? Something you may have used is an online calculator. You can see here that I've
[00:00:31.760 → 00:00:38.240] put in parameters for a 15 inch driver with 60 mils of excursion which is pretty reasonable these days
[00:00:38.240 → 00:00:44.640] for a high excursion, low frequency sub, tuned to about 30 hertz and you can see that the minimum
[00:00:44.640 → 00:00:51.200] diameter of the port quoted here is bigger than the driver itself. So of course that just can't be
[00:00:51.200 → 00:00:57.520] right. You can see boxes everywhere in home theater with ports which are way small than that
[00:00:57.520 → 00:01:03.120] with subs which are comparable to this one here. So first off I'm going to be looking at problems
[00:01:03.120 → 00:01:08.800] with ports which are too small. Now in order for two things to be just as loud they need to move
[00:01:08.800 → 00:01:16.640] the same amount of air. So for a 5 centimeter port and a 20 centimeter wide port, air needs to be moving
[00:01:16.640 → 00:01:24.000] 16 times faster through the 5 centimeter port than the 20 centimeter port. That's why this one here is
[00:01:24.000 → 00:01:30.160] so large because it's trying to avoid air rushing through the port so quickly and creating turbulence.
[00:01:30.160 → 00:01:36.480] So turbulence is created when air is moving out of the port very quickly and it meets this kind of
[00:01:37.120 → 00:01:45.200] barrier where it goes from fast throwing all coherent into just an open space and it all goes to hell.
[00:01:45.200 → 00:01:51.920] There's air moving everywhere, turbulence forms which is the leading cause of chuffing which is a common
[00:01:51.920 → 00:01:57.520] thing with ported boxes and here you can see that with the large port because the air is moving more
[00:01:57.520 → 00:02:03.120] slowly through it there's a lot less turbulence and thus there's a lot less chuffing. You can of course
[00:02:03.120 → 00:02:08.480] flare it and you can see here with the large port that there's no more turbulence at all but with a
[00:02:08.480 → 00:02:14.800] small port there's still a bit of turbulence. Now you can if you make the port super big you can get away
[00:02:14.800 → 00:02:20.400] with getting no turbulence through a small port but then you may as well go with a large port in the
[00:02:20.400 → 00:02:27.760] first case. Although you do get a bit more box space efficient if you do a small port with huge
[00:02:27.760 → 00:02:34.800] flares on either end. I see it in some compact bookshelf speakers such as KEF has a silicone port,
[00:02:34.800 → 00:02:42.400] like a flexible port which has a big flare on the front and the rear. As for the characteristics of a
[00:02:42.400 → 00:02:52.160] small port dynamics can suffer meaning that kicks aren't quite as tight and it leads to a muddy sound.
[00:02:52.160 → 00:02:58.880] So that's often why a small port or a port which is too small is actually good for home theater sub.
[00:02:59.760 → 00:03:07.360] Rumbles don't need to be particularly accurate they're more or less just noise so any infrasonics you can
[00:03:07.360 → 00:03:14.000] actually use a small port and flare it at either end just to save a bit of box volume because by the
[00:03:14.000 → 00:03:20.080] time you try to make a relatively small unit try to tune it to 20 hertz the port would need to be so
[00:03:20.080 → 00:03:27.920] wide it's absolutely enormous its length is two meters plus in some cases. So if you make it smaller
[00:03:27.920 → 00:03:34.880] you can fit it all within the box nicely without having to sacrifice any sound quality due to it being
[00:03:34.880 → 00:03:40.720] tuned low. And now I'm going to talk about problems with ports which are too big. With a correct size
[00:03:40.720 → 00:03:46.960] port when you stop setting power to the voice coil it should stop making sound. This is a common reason
[00:03:46.960 → 00:03:53.760] why people prefer sealed to ported because ported can lose definition the port can be wanting to do its
[00:03:53.760 → 00:04:01.200] own thing and this is a bit of an example of that. So when you stop sending power to the voice coil sound
[00:04:01.200 → 00:04:07.600] should stop immediately and with with properly damped ports you'll see that as soon as the signal
[00:04:07.600 → 00:04:14.720] stops the wave should stop. But a problem with large ports is that the damping is less so even after the
[00:04:14.720 → 00:04:21.120] signal stops going to the driver a bit of air can keep moving in and out of the port like when you blow
[00:04:21.120 → 00:04:28.960] over a bottle and you hear a go hmmm. So what this leads to is the sound coming from the speaker is less
[00:04:28.960 → 00:04:35.520] tight less accurate and has a bit of a kind of boomy nature to it. It wants to peak more around the port
[00:04:35.520 → 00:04:41.760] and yeah that's not very good for sound quality but it is good for SPL because you want a big
[00:04:41.760 → 00:04:48.720] high resonance so going with a big port for SPL is often a good thing. So what is the best size for a
[00:04:48.720 → 00:04:54.480] port? If I've talked about what's bad about small what's bad about large what's the best compromise?
[00:04:54.480 → 00:05:00.160] And I do actually have an answer. I've seen this in many different places and it all seems to line
[00:05:00.160 → 00:05:08.160] up the same thing. The best way to design a ported box is to go with 16 square inches per cubic foot
[00:05:08.160 → 00:05:16.000] which ends up being 100 square centimeters per 28 liters or 3.6 square centimeters per liter of box
[00:05:16.000 → 00:05:25.040] volume. So these are all port surface area to box volume ratios. For a 10 cubic foot box you want 160
[00:05:25.040 → 00:05:33.840] square inches which is like a big 16 by 10 inch port or maybe a 32 by 5 inch port something like that
[00:05:33.840 → 00:05:39.680] and of course you can do the calculations for the metric yourself if you want to do them. These are all
[00:05:39.680 → 00:05:47.760] for square or rectangular ports. If you're doing a round port you can actually make the box bigger than
[00:05:47.760 → 00:05:54.960] one cubic foot per 16 square inches. You can make ports smaller if they're more aerodynamic. So if you've
[00:05:54.960 → 00:06:00.880] got a flared port you can make the port slightly smaller. If you've got an aero port you can make it smaller.
[00:06:01.600 → 00:06:08.720] Also if you do have a round port compared to a rectangular or square port you can make it smaller.
[00:06:08.720 → 00:06:15.600] And if you have an un-aerodynamic port such as a rectangular port that has a corner in it which
[00:06:15.600 → 00:06:21.920] doesn't have any sort of curving in the corner then you can make it slightly bigger than 16 square
[00:06:21.920 → 00:06:28.320] inches per cubic foot maybe 20 square inches per cubic foot as the restriction of airflow damps it
[00:06:28.320 → 00:06:35.360] just a bit more so it doesn't ring. A couple of examples of where I found this ratio before I
[00:06:35.360 → 00:06:41.120] tested it in a box myself and found out that it does work pretty damn well is here on digital design
[00:06:41.120 → 00:06:48.320] site. You can see their one cubic foot box has more 15 square inches of vent but two is 32, three is 48
[00:06:48.320 → 00:06:54.720] and they all divide to go to 16 square inches of port area per cubic foot. This is quoted on the website.
[00:06:54.720 → 00:07:01.360] Another example I'd look at is on Sundown's website where I found the NSV4 10 inch driver.
[00:07:01.360 → 00:07:09.840] They suggest a one and a half cubic foot box with a 24 square inch port surface area. So you can see right here
[00:07:10.400 → 00:07:16.160] that that is 16 square inches per cubic foot of box volume just like digital designs.
[00:07:16.160 → 00:07:19.600] So yeah thanks for watching. If you enjoyed this video and learned anything from it
[00:07:19.600 → 00:07:26.400] uh feel free to like and subscribe and also just wondering what's your opinion. Now I've seen other
[00:07:26.400 → 00:07:33.200] sizes in other videos for example comparing port surface area with driver surface area for example
[00:07:33.200 → 00:07:41.120] Showtime SPL Ed Leicester. He mentions that he tunes his ports per driver surface area for SPL. So yeah that's
[00:07:41.120 → 00:07:49.840] an example where in SPL it's often a good idea to tune the port surface area to the driver surface area
[00:07:49.840 → 00:07:56.160] rather than the box volume. But once again feel free to leave your own opinion in the comments below.
[00:07:56.160 → 00:08:01.280] I look forward to seeing how other people do it and I might even test some of them if they sound good.
[00:08:01.280 → 00:08:11.440] Yep, thanks for watching and see ya!
