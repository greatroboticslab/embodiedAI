The main mode that was discussed was the angle mode, where the user inputs the control of the drone, but is easier for beginners because it does not allow the drone to do flips. Then he introduces acro-mode, which allows advanced users to do flips because the input controller has more of an effect on the rotation speed and angle of the drone. He suggests using online simulations beforehand to get comfortable with the precision of the throttle and stick control to prevent any damage to your drone when first starting out.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoHjWZFTnpQ: How to Fly a FPV Drone: Complete Guide for Beginners!"}]}
