      "coverage_text": "Hey what's happening guys I thought today we might talk about this little guy right here\nthis chip this strange looking chip is the TDA 2030 which is a class AB amplifier chip\nnow if you think back to the times we've talked about amplifiers a class a\namplifier which is the most linear but the least efficient operates for the\nentire sine wave cycle from 0 to 360 degrees a class B amplifier operates on\nonly half the signal either from 0 to 180 or 181 to 360 it's more efficient but it\nis hardly linear and not very useful in audio because it's going to produce some\ndistortions but if you take the class A and the class B and you kind of put them\ntogether you get a class AB amplifier which is also known as a push-pull\namplifier and its characteristic is it is almost as linear as a class A amplifier\nbecause it operates for more than 180 degrees but less than 360 so instead of\nbeing on all the time getting hot and wasting power it's off for a small part\nof the cycle and that works out pretty well now what we were talking about is\nthis little guy here this is the TDA 2030 and it's from ST.com now has a wide voltage\nsupply up to 36 volts but you have to go that high it will operate as low as 6 volts but\n12 volts is a good place to start single or split supply that means if you think of\nthis somewhat as an op amp you can operate as an op amp with a plus vs and a minus vs but\nit's not necessary you can operate it with a single supply as well it has short circuit protection and a\nthermal out or a thermal shut down you see typically it provides 14 outputs of power\nnow that of course depends on your input voltage the impedance of the speaker and\nthose sorts of things but this is a really oh this by the way this package with the five leads is called the\npentawatt package just thought I'd throw that in there so a couple more things to talk about with this amplifier\nhere are some of its electrical characteristics so supply voltage a plus or minus 18 or 36 volts input voltage\nblah blah blah blah so here we go come down here and we talk about our supply voltage\nminimum six we build something we build with probably 12 volts and its quiescent current drain is 40 milliamps\nthat's not that small so this thing's going to drain power even when it's using that's the class a part of the amplifier in there it's always working\nnow our input bias is 0.2 to 2 microamps and our offset voltage is plus 2 to plus 20 millivolts\ncouple things to keep in mind\nit's pretty good on distortion half a percent now our frequency response our minus 3 dB so this is basically we'll call it the low cut frequency\nthe low cut frequency is 10 to 140 hertz depending on how you set it up that's great for audio stuff\ndrain current 900 500 let's split the difference call it 600 milliamps\nokay so what I've done here",
