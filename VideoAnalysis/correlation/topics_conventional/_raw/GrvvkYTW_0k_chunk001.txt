The coherent topics discussed in this transcript segment are:

1. Calculating the power dissipation of a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) using the formula "resistance times current squared".
2. Determining the maximum power the transistor can dissipate without using a heatsink, based on the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance and the maximum junction temperature.
3. Understanding the difference between the maximum power dissipation with a heatsink (79 watts in this case) and the maximum power dissipation without a heatsink (2.4 watts).
4. Reviewing the key points for using a MOSFET as a switch, including finding the gate, drain, and source pins, determining the threshold voltage, and calculating the thermal resistance.
5. Providing additional resources and tools, such as a PDF form for calculating MOSFET parameters, and encouraging viewers to ask questions or provide feedback.
