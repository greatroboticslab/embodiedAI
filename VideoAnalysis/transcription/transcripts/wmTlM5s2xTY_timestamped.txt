[00:00:00.480 → 00:00:05.760] so this is the Mitac when you open it there's the Mitac spread board
[00:00:08.400 → 00:00:12.720] and then it should come with a paper uh it's like an envelope with papers
[00:00:13.280 → 00:00:16.640] the manuals and stuff you have these three cables
[00:00:19.200 → 00:00:21.040] and this piece
[00:00:23.680 → 00:00:29.200] here you have the pieces which are here and the terminal connector is i put it in this bag
[00:00:30.000 → 00:00:35.840] essentially you don't need the audio cables so you can just put this aside
[00:00:37.520 → 00:00:42.480] there are two links that you have to go to and this is where you find the zero number but i will
[00:00:42.480 → 00:00:47.680] tell you personally the zero number is located right here it says sn zero number
[00:00:50.000 → 00:00:55.200] this is the first website and this is how you download it basically you have it on all the
[00:00:55.200 → 00:01:01.280] last test settings except this 32-bit is fine english or whatever you prefer and just click download
[00:01:04.320 → 00:01:09.520] downloading the package manager after you follow the steps you just make an account
[00:01:09.520 → 00:01:16.400] and it'll do all of this you just agree uh there's lab view and basically
[00:01:16.400 → 00:01:27.760] everything that you need it's already pre-selected you click next this is the software bundle
[00:01:29.360 → 00:01:30.320] i always agree
[00:01:33.120 → 00:01:35.040] you want to read it read it
[00:01:35.040 → 00:01:49.120] just click next until it finishes and maybe we will finish now now we have all of this here
[00:01:49.840 → 00:01:55.520] for the my doc if you are looking to calculate voltage you plug the red cable right here
[00:01:55.520 → 00:02:02.480] otherwise if you want to calculate the current you plug it in here the black one always goes to the black
[00:02:04.480 → 00:02:10.000] spot and then this one really it depends just plug it in
[00:02:12.160 → 00:02:20.720] we'll make it snug this is kind of tricky this is an up close shot of how it looks these are looking up
[00:02:20.720 → 00:02:29.920] and just but you gotta press it hard until it kind of clicks make sure it's really tight don't be afraid
[00:02:31.040 → 00:02:34.000] and that's it this is where you would connect all the cables and stuff
[00:02:35.920 → 00:02:43.680] now we plug one end of the usb cable and the actual usb cable goes to your computer
[00:02:43.680 → 00:02:56.880] this shows up as soon as you plug it in now go to the bottom and click on launch instruments and apps
[00:02:56.880 → 00:02:57.680] for this device
[00:03:00.320 → 00:03:05.200] this should pop up and now you have all of this that you will use throughout the course
[00:03:06.560 → 00:03:11.200] with this you can access the digital multimeter for example the dc level
[00:03:14.400 → 00:03:19.120] a very important feature is that n i launcher which should download
[00:03:20.960 → 00:03:28.400] through computer so my launcher which will be this and here is the n i registration wizard
[00:03:29.040 → 00:03:36.640] that the papers here talk about just follow the instructions and that's where you register everything
[00:03:36.640 → 00:03:40.400] and then it should work now so now we'll show you how it works
[00:03:40.400 → 00:03:47.200] now once you input your information this would happen so you click yet register
[00:03:48.080 → 00:03:53.040] i mean it knows that you're connected to this one for example and then yeah use web browser
[00:03:53.040 → 00:04:03.600] just register just keep clicking yes until it stops asking you for more stuff
[00:04:04.560 → 00:04:05.760] um
[00:04:05.760 → 00:04:14.160] yeah register a product so you put the zero number now that i put the serial number this shows up
[00:04:14.800 → 00:04:19.840] uh registration is in progress so now we need to wait
[00:04:19.840 → 00:04:30.080] now we've waited a little while we reload this and we can see let's see it's still loading
[00:04:30.080 → 00:04:41.840] we can active software right the activation process is right here uh we already got our zero number
[00:04:41.840 → 00:04:48.080] since you know we already did this process it already knows um now we can actually activate it
[00:04:48.080 → 00:04:55.120] i have created a simple circuit which is just positive goes around a resistor and comes back negative
[00:04:56.080 → 00:05:04.720] positive starts from zero ao zero to the yellow to the positive line that is connected the whole way here
[00:05:04.720 → 00:05:12.000] horizontally and the negative is also all the way up to here connected horizontally uh below the spread board
[00:05:12.000 → 00:05:21.520] so we start at yellow goes to the green goes to the resistor goes back to the blue and goes through the negative
[00:05:21.520 → 00:05:27.840] to the orange back to ground a ground would be negative and this is exactly what is going on here
[00:05:27.840 → 00:05:33.680] now if we want to calculate for example the current that goes through this resistor this is what we would do
[00:05:34.320 → 00:05:39.200] first let's say we have one cup voltage in here in the dc level output which you can find
[00:05:39.200 → 00:05:47.440] over here multimeter dc level you put one you start it up it's running you start up this which is
[00:05:47.440 → 00:05:52.800] already running for me remember to put it in the current click run and set this to the current this
[00:05:52.800 → 00:05:58.880] is voltage this is current set it to the current and now all we have to do this does depend on which
[00:05:58.880 → 00:06:05.440] one goes first so we're going to put the positive side red and the negative side black so we put it right
[00:06:05.440 → 00:06:14.240] here like so right there on each end and we can see a positive two milliamps and it might be a little
[00:06:14.240 → 00:06:19.120] volatile depending on you know the accuracy of this thing but if you take it off it's here and if you
[00:06:19.120 → 00:06:25.280] put it backwards like so this is extremely hard to do with one hand important thing to point out is
[00:06:25.280 → 00:06:31.040] that you cannot do this a resistor cannot go just through its own line you short the circuit here this
[00:06:31.040 → 00:06:36.640] makes more sense you got to put it on at least the next one just a different one the next one or even
[00:06:36.640 → 00:06:42.960] in the next section this right here symbolizes a break so you can definitely do this switch from one
[00:06:42.960 → 00:06:48.240] side to another side you can't just do it on the same side the same line you'll short the circuit or it
[00:06:48.240 → 00:06:54.240] will be unnecessary if you do it with something like a regular jump wire you want to change it from
[00:06:54.240 → 00:07:00.080] one to another you unscrew a little bit you change it and say back to this one where we wanted it and push it a little
[00:07:00.080 → 00:07:06.720] bit and we just righty tighty lefty losing and this is tight and we can work on it that's how you do it
[00:07:06.720 → 00:07:10.880] it's pretty simple this comes with the breadboard and the my deck and everything else most of the
[00:07:10.880 → 00:07:14.960] information you will be asked shows over here you know obviously you cannot just read from this
[00:07:14.960 → 00:07:19.360] because the graph is not very accurate you have to look at this uh there's times you're gonna look at
[00:07:19.360 → 00:07:25.040] this and there's times you're gonna look at this so just letting you know what is it you're looking
[00:07:25.040 → 00:07:29.840] for when looking at this grass also when you want to access the main panel you will look at it from here
[00:07:29.840 → 00:07:33.040] and touch this button and it'll appear once again if you don't know how to go back to this you don't
[00:07:33.040 → 00:07:37.680] have to unplug and plug back again don't like that you go to instruments and it will appear back again
[00:07:37.680 → 00:07:44.320] also we're going to be using at the very end the bottom analyzer boat analyzer yeah this so basically
[00:07:44.320 → 00:07:49.040] now i'm going to show you exactly an example of how you would use this in an in an assignment
[00:07:49.040 → 00:08:02.560] so now i'm going to show you how to use the boat analyzer oh sorry um um basically you're going to be
[00:08:02.560 → 00:08:11.280] given the resistor the resistance um the capacitor all the values for that the start frequency and the
[00:08:11.280 → 00:08:18.480] stop frequency if you go back over here let's pull this if you go back over here you can see start
[00:08:18.480 → 00:08:27.280] frequencies right here it's 10 in this example and then 20k uh for stop frequency and peak amplitude
[00:08:27.280 → 00:08:36.560] will stay at 2 and all we have to do is make this a small circuit following this small diagram so we have
[00:08:36.560 → 00:08:47.040] two grounds a capacitor uh the vo which is the voltage uh this must be v in and a resistor and this
[00:08:47.040 → 00:08:54.320] is in the middle of the resistor and the capacitor such as we can see here uh so this is resistor
[00:08:54.320 → 00:09:04.000] capacitor and uh the v oh i mean we could also get a different with this uh my recommendation is just
[00:09:04.000 → 00:09:08.480] try different things uh it's not that hard you just gotta play with it a little bit uh we have your
[00:09:08.480 → 00:09:16.000] regular ground connected to the other grounds uh here through this you have uh the vo right here in
[00:09:16.000 → 00:09:24.640] the middle like we said the vo in the middle and the v in right here next to this uh ground which goes to
[00:09:24.640 → 00:09:33.280] zero plus now we just run it after we have all the values input so when we run it we can see um
[00:09:34.080 → 00:09:41.680] perhaps a sort of similar graph to last time it did change a little bit but uh not entirely values
[00:09:41.680 → 00:09:47.760] were given here perfectly and this is what you have to input in the and for the answers once you do all
[00:09:47.760 → 00:09:54.320] of this these are the values that you're looking for right here in the x and y axis use these two that
[00:09:54.320 → 00:10:01.840] go together uh this is further down the class but this is an up amp which basically is this little triangle
[00:10:01.840 → 00:10:07.600] here so it goes this way there's a little circle that you might be able to see in the camera
[00:10:09.360 → 00:10:16.080] yep and so you identify which is one and which is two so it's one two three four five six seven
[00:10:16.080 → 00:10:24.240] right this would be eight in theory but yeah so this is two is three this is four this is six this is seven
[00:10:24.240 → 00:10:34.960] and that is how you look at it you might be wondering where's eight and five well yes they're here so
[00:10:34.960 → 00:10:43.200] more questions thank you now we're gonna go ahead and assume that this is vcc uh not assume but we're
[00:10:43.200 → 00:10:52.000] gonna assume that vcc is 15. vcc would be this one and this would be vee we're giving 15 which is exactly
[00:10:52.560 → 00:11:03.200] what is shown right here and we're gonna then assume that the v in and vo are two volts now when
[00:11:03.200 → 00:11:11.200] you go here in the function generator you see that you have the amps here's where you put two it's the
[00:11:11.200 → 00:11:17.760] same function that we use here but we don't use this because they you overwrite the system we only use
[00:11:17.760 → 00:11:28.400] this that has two in one so we say two and then we say let's say let's say 100 as depicted here we're
[00:11:28.400 → 00:11:36.320] gonna have 100 and we're gonna run it we're also gonna run this this is just the measures this is
[00:11:36.320 → 00:11:43.360] uh the scale which one is fine and this is a one zero now this is where it gets complicated because a one
[00:11:44.080 → 00:11:53.040] zero is right here it's a new concept we're looking at this is a one this is zero zero plus will go
[00:11:53.040 → 00:12:02.640] according to this two the cv plus is going to number three we can see it right here this is v in
[00:12:03.440 → 00:12:08.720] that would be and that would be number three right here one two three and this is
[00:12:10.320 → 00:12:16.800] that one which goes to a zero a negative and one negative go to the negative which is connected
[00:12:16.800 → 00:12:26.640] through here to a ground perfect and that is how we get this now we have once you run it we have this
[00:12:26.640 → 00:12:32.960] you just zoom out a little bit and you will start getting a better shape now these numbers are going
[00:12:32.960 → 00:12:40.320] to be given i'm just showing you where to plug in plug them in anyways yep that's basically it and then
[00:12:40.320 → 00:12:47.680] you can when you have two of these two up amps you can select this and then enable it and make another
[00:12:47.680 → 00:12:51.600] whole circuit in the other side but for now we're just going to leave it at one because you get the
[00:12:51.600 → 00:13:00.720] basics you chance to do everything again but for this side now this resistor for example is going from
[00:13:00.720 → 00:13:14.400] two to two to six as we can see so we go two resistor six this is two resistor then six after the six
[00:13:16.800 → 00:13:30.240] we can see there's a vo and this is where vo comes in over here at a one zero and then this a one one plus
[00:13:31.280 → 00:13:37.200] is the one that we named which was over here and three which is this one and this right here means
[00:13:37.200 → 00:13:47.200] ground ground ground is connected right here so you don't really need to connect the two number three
[00:13:47.200 → 00:13:57.440] per se here i can move a one uh which is also connected even though we have another up amp for
[00:13:57.440 → 00:14:03.040] example this problem so this is ground you have a grounded with the other ones uh which will be the
[00:14:03.040 → 00:14:08.960] negative spots over here in a1 that's basically how you set up this you just follow the instructions
[00:14:09.520 → 00:14:16.320] uh they tell you the frequency the voltage and the setup you might have more resistors there might be a
[00:14:16.320 → 00:14:21.440] little bit more of a mess here but this is basically the basics and with this you can work on the future
[00:14:21.440 → 00:14:28.160] just add whatever they ask you so this should get you started on this those are the basics you should
[00:14:28.160 → 00:14:33.920] be ready there are other implications uh to using these and it's not so straightforward just putting
[00:14:33.920 → 00:14:38.960] one end here and one end here and you got it sometimes you need to do a little bit different
[00:14:38.960 → 00:14:50.480] stuff but you will learn that in the course so good luck and this is the end of the super tutorial
[00:14:50.480 → 00:14:59.040] too
