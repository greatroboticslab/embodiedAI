1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,980
Let's face it, we've all been at one point where an electronic circuit works so well on perfboards

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,360
that you want to build more units of it.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,500
But creating these solder traces takes up way too much time.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,440
Or you ogled a new awesome IC that would be perfect for your next project.

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,480
But sadly it does only exist as an SMD package, which makes perfboard soldering pretty hard to do.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:39,000
In both cases creating a proper PCB design and ordering it from a PCB manufacturing house is the way to go to save time and play around easily with SMD components.

7
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:46,820
So in this video I will be showing you step by step what to look out for when creating the schematic of your project

8
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:55,420
and how we can then turn it easily into a PCB design that we can order through a couple of simple clicks for quite a low price.

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,420
Let's get started!

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:17,640
As a practical example for this video I will be using this relatively simple double-sided PCB that I designed.

11
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,640
Which brings me to the first step of this tutorial.

12
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,940
Planning the function of the circuits.

13
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,620
I knew that I wanted to create a microcontroller based circuit.

14
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:35,220
That reads the position of a joystick and then sends the values through the RF band to receiver.

15
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,780
Also I wanted to power the circuit through a LiPo battery.

16
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:47,340
Which means I needed a LiPo charge controller IC, a micro USB port to deliver the power for charging.

17
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,300
And a power switch to connect the battery voltage to a 3.3V regulator.

18
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,460
Which converts the unregulated battery voltage into a suitable voltage for the microcontroller.

19
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Last but not least I wanted to monitor the battery voltage through a voltage divider with the microcontroller.

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:15,140
So that when the battery voltage gets close to 3.4V the RF functionality shuts down and the yellow LED lights up.

21
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,820
And with the function of the circuit planned out it was time for step 2.

22
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,320
Which involves searching for suitable components and creating a paper schematic.

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,000
For component sourcing I like to use LCSC.

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because their selection is not only big.

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,320
But also because we will be ordering the PCBs through JLCPCB later on.

26
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,000
And we can combine that with the LCSC order and thus save shipping costs.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,680
But anyway once I decided on the main ICs.

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,680
Which were the ATMEGA328 as a microcontroller.

29
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,240
An NRF24 as the RF transmitter.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,120
A TP4056 as the charge controller.

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,960
And a TPS76933dBVR as the voltage regulator.

32
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,800
It was time to think about the packages.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
The package basically describes how the IC will physically look like.

34
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:17,400
And determines whether it is a THT or SMD component.

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,960
For example while the NRF24 is only available as a breakout board in THT.

36
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,900
And the TP4056 is only available as an SMD version.

37
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,280
We do have the choice between THT and SMD for the microcontroller.

38
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,300
But since I wanted the circuit to be as small as possible.

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,800
I went with the SMD version.

40
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:45,400
Which I also set as the standard for the remaining complementary components.

41
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Next I planned out on a piece of paper.

42
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,080
How to connect the main ICs to one another.

43
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,980
And also what passive components are necessary to make them all work.

44
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,780
To find that out.

45
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,460
I had a closer look at all the data sheets of the ICs.

46
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,120
And the recommended example circuits.

47
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,060
And if everything fails you can always google your question.

48
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,340
Which should give you a suitable answer in 99% of the cases.

49
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,940
The last thing to do for the paper circuits was to add breakout points.

50
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,940
So that I could later program the microcontroller.

51
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,540
And also hook up the battery and LEDs to the circuits.

52
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Which will be mounted in a separate enclosure.

53
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,220
Now for the passive component selection.

54
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,220
I mainly went with 0603 as the package size.

55
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,540
Which stands for 0.06 by 0.03 inches.

56
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,540
Or 1.6 by 0.8 millimeters.

57
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,820
There also exists a 0402 and a 0201 package.

58
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,140
But I think 0603 is neither too big or too small.

59
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,540
And can still be soldered with an iron with a bit of practice.

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,380
And with the component selection and paper schematic being completed.

61
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,540
It was time for step 3.

62
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,020
Creating a proper schematic.

63
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,980
For that I used the EasyEDA free online circuit creator.

64
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,860
After logging in I created a new project.

65
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,340
And there a new schematic.

66
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,820
Then I simply used their online library.

67
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,660
Which also includes pretty much all LCSC components.

68
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,300
To search for my utilized components.

69
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,860
And firstly imported them into the workspace.

70
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,140
But make sure that you choose components.

71
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,380
With the right package and correct footprint.

72
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,540
Otherwise the PCB design will later not work out.

73
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,420
Once all the main actors of the circuit were imported.

74
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,340
I then used the left aligned resistors with the right package.

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,660
And capacitors with the right package.

76
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,820
As the complementary passive components.

77
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,620
And of course we should not forget.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,380
To add male header connectors.

79
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,500
For the breakout points.

80
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,180
Now that we got all of our required components.

81
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,980
In the editor.

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,180
We can arrange them to logical blocks.

83
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,580
Which in my case is the power parts.

84
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,100
And the microcontroller parts.

85
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,420
Once that was done.

86
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,220
I utilized the wire function of the software.

87
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,020
To connect all the components to one another.

88
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,420
According to how I planned it out on paper.

89
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,580
Last but not least.

90
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,340
I then added the ground.

91
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,380
VCC.

92
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,340
And battery voltage supply flags to the schematic.

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,180
Which not only completes it.

94
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,060
But also ends the third step of this tutorial.

95
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,580
That means it is time for the last step.

96
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,620
Step 4.

97
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,780
Which is PCB design and ordering.

98
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,460
For that.

99
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,420
We firstly have to click the convert to PCB button.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,940
Which automatically throws all the component footprints.

101
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,380
Into the PCB editor.

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,100
Shows how to connect them through the blue lines.

103
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,980
And creates a PCB outline for us.

104
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,620
The first thing I did though.

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,540
Was removing the outline.

106
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,540
Because as I mentioned earlier.

107
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,700
I needed a specific PCB size.

108
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,580
For the enclosure.

109
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,420
To do that.

110
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,740
I changed the measuring system to millimeters.

111
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,700
Selected the board outline layer.

112
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,980
And used the track tool.

113
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,380
In combination with the given coordinates.

114
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,980
In the down right corner.

115
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:14,140
To create the correct size for the PCB.

116
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,740
Then I moved the micro USB port.

117
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,020
The main power switch.

118
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,900
And the joystick.

119
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,580
To the required position.

120
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,500
According to the enclosure's cutouts.

121
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,300
To later mount the PCB.

122
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,380
I also added three pads.

123
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,900
Whose size I enlarged.

124
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,220
So that M3 screws would fit through them.

125
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,620
And with that being done.

126
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,340
I placed the rest of the components onto the PCB.

127
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,100
Of course.

128
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,180
You want to separate the power parts.

129
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,620
And microcontroller part a bit.

130
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,380
And also make sure.

131
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,700
That the pins slash components.

132
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,980
That need to get connected.

133
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,260
To one another.

134
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,180
Are physically close to one another.

135
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,420
So that the copper trace length.

136
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,020
Can be as short as possible.

137
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,420
As soon as you think.

138
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,180
Your layout looks logical.

139
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,180
We could use the given auto router.

140
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,620
To do the wiring for us.

141
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,500
But as you might already have guessed.

142
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,500
That is often not the best solution.

143
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,380
So let's do it manually.

144
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,460
By selecting the top layer.

145
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,820
And using the track tool.

146
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,740
To simply connect all the components.

147
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,620
To one another.

148
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,860
But before doing so.

149
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,460
We have to talk about the width.

150
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,340
Of the traces.

151
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,420
Which is usually set to 0.254 millimeters.

152
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,740
If we use an online trace width calculator.

153
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,900
And set the ounce value to 1.

154
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,340
Which is the standard value.

155
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,860
For JLC PCBs.

156
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,780
Then the trace could handle.

157
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,020
Around 0.885 amps.

158
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,620
Of current on outer layers.

159
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,060
Which is enough.

160
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,060
But I always like to work.

161
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,380
With a width of 0.3 millimeters.

162
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,060
Since that gives me.

163
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,580
A maximum of 1 amp.

164
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,220
And with that out of the way.

165
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,300
I created all possible connections.

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,580
On the top layer.

167
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,540
While making sure.

168
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,780
To not use 90 degree bends.

169
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:00,620
Since that is bad practice.

170
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,620
And everyone in the comment section.

171
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,340
Will hate you.

172
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,660
The only problem.

173
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,340
With this top layer wiring.

174
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,260
Was that after a short while.

175
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,340
I was running out of space.

176
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,180
And not all necessary connections.

177
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,980
Were made yet.

178
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,980
But don't worry.

179
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,140
Since we can switch to the bottom layer.

180
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,580
And do the rest wiring there.

181
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,060
Which would be very simple to do.

182
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,900
For THD components.

183
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,940
Since the solder pads.

184
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,540
Penetrate through all layers.

185
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,940
But for SMD components.

186
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,900
We have to create.

187
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,860
A so called via.

188
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,940
It is basically.

189
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,980
A small tunnel.

190
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,100
That connects the top.

191
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,980
And bottom layer.

192
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,740
And just like that.

193
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,260
We can finish the wiring.

194
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,780
Even for SMD components.

195
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,740
On the bottom layer.

196
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,900
Now here is my finished.

197
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,020
PCB design.

198
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,380
To which you would answer.

199
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,900
It is not finished yet.

200
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,340
Since all ground connections.

201
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,060
Are not made.

202
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,740
Well.

203
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,380
For those.

204
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,580
We can simply select.

205
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,860
The top layer.

206
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
And use the copper region tool.

207
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,460
To encircle the whole PCB.

208
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,620
And just like that.

209
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,700
The traces got isolated.

210
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,860
And the rest of the top layer space.

211
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,180
Is used as a solid copper ground layer.

212
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:08,700
Of course.

213
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,500
If you want to.

214
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,260
You could also repeat this process.

215
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,220
For the bottom layer.

216
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,300
At this point.

217
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,500
The PCB design.

218
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,620
Is basically complete.

219
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,900
Which means.

220
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,700
We can click.

221
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,140
Generate Gerber files.

222
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,500
In order to download them.

223
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:22,300
Or.

224
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,260
We can directly.

225
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,700
Order our finished products.

226
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,220
From JLC PCB.

227
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,580
Which I did.

228
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,220
And after waiting for a week.

229
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,180
I was greeted.

230
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,220
With 10 copies.

231
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,860
Of my board.

232
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,180
Which did not only look promising.

233
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,700
Under the microscope.

234
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,660
But also worked.

235
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,860
Without any problems.

236
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,140
Now.

237
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,100
If you're curious.

238
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,460
How to solder the components.

239
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,980
To such a PCB.

240
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,780
Then definitely.

241
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,260
Make sure.

242
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,940
To watch my soldering tutorial.

243
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,980
About the subjects.

244
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,820
As always.

245
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,860
I hope you enjoyed.

246
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,220
Watching this video.

247
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,660
And learned a thing or two.

248
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,940
About PCB design.

249
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,540
If so.

250
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,900
Don't forget to like.

251
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,300
Share.

252
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,020
And subscribe.

253
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
Stay creative.

254
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,940
And I will see you.

255
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,060
Next time.
