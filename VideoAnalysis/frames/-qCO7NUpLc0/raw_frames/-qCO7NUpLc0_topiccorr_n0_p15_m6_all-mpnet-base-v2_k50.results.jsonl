The circuit constructed in this video only used a couple of resistors and a couple of capacitors and produced a high-quality sound. Things learned from this video is one way to construct a good sounding speaker circuit using the TDA 2030 that is relatively simple in construction that used only a couple of components. Some points of confusion regarding this video is if the plate the TDA 2030 is attached to, I wonder if that is just a general base plat or if that is supposed to be some type of heat sink. Another thing I was confused about is the positive and negative wires of the input jack and the wires connected to the speaker, I was not sure which was which when it was wired into the circuit.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qCO7NUpLc0: How to make powerful amplifier. using TDA2030 ic.
