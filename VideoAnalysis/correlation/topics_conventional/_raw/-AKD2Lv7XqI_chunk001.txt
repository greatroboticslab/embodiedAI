Based on the provided transcript segment, I have extracted coherent topics that are relevant to the discussion of band pass filters:

1. **Design and construction of a band pass filter**: The speaker explains how to create a band pass filter by combining low-pass and high-pass filters, using specific components (capacitors and resistors) and layout on a breadboard.
2. **Frequency response and attenuation**: The speaker demonstrates the frequency response of the band pass filter, showing how it passes signals within a specific frequency range (1k to 30k Hz) while attenuating signals outside this range.
3. **Practical application and measurement**: The speaker uses an oscilloscope to measure the output signal and demonstrate the effectiveness of the band pass filter in selecting a specific frequency band.

These topics are central to the discussion of band pass filters, and the transcript segment provides a clear and concise explanation of how they work and how to design and build one.
