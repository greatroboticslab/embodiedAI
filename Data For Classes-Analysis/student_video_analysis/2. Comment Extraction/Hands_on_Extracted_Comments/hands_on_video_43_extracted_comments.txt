Awesome work, Nic! We'd love to chat! What's the best way to reach you?

hello , please can you sharing with me schematic assembly, if possisble !!!

nice invers kinematic explicacion

Very very cool! This is so good.

great explaining, and we learned lot. you could create community with teaching fun way electornics or if you do game programming

Can you make proper  video

on what pins do u connect the motors of the pca9685

Парень молодец , у тебя собачка как Aibo такая же плавность хода за 3000 долларов !

You helped me understand how to do all this greatly thank you very much keep making these awesome videos

hi. how much power does your robot actually draw to stand up from ground and also to walk from after standing? please let me know if you can check electric current from the power supply.

Where do you have publicated the 3d models?

Sir can you please provide the code for this...........

hey can you poste the cad please

amazing job! I want to learn how to design robotic joints (hinge and ball in socket types) and how to use actuators to move them efficiently… where can I start?

Great work man! Just a thing, please reduce the volume of the tings 😅

Daer Nic  i would like to make this robot dog for my children 2 y/o and 5 y/o for riding , kindly  teach how i can achieve this Thanks

That's super impressive! Does anyone know if a leg like this could be replicated with servos that are limited to 180 degrees of freedom?

can i get your 3d designs link

Great content!!! This looks like a fun individual project I could do during summer. Could you also do a tutorial video where you show how you drew the dog on fusion… that will be much appreciated ❤️

How did you figure out the dimensions of each component/part of the drawing/cad

Wow, thanks! You can reach me through my email nic.aqs98@gmail.com

@NicAqueous  thanks for email bro

@mr.hilarious9107  💀

@notAnxyte  what?

@mr.hilarious9107  lol

Bruahhhh look who's in townn💥🔥

Arduino you guys are the best

Glad to hear!

You would have to scale it bigger and use more powerful motors to achieve that.

Hey, my servos are limited to 180 degrees as well. So yes, you definitely can!

@NicAqueous  Thanks so much for your reply it's of great help. I’ve since went through all posts and videos of your robot because it's truly remarkable what you were able to achieve. Are you planning on continuing the series anytime soon? For a young maker like me ppl like you are really inspiring and I was able to learn so much! :)

What are the specifications of those servoes that you used for this project (mainly the value of kg/cm)?

Not a robot dog with those back legs. Stop copying darpas shortcuts. 2 left arms 2 right arms. Try real dog leg design.  Since your learning i can saygood job but dont call it a dog.

This is super helpful.

Bro can I get the way to contact with you I want discuss the same project idea with you

what software did you use for the modelling?

Plzz give Amazon part adress,,, because Amazon facilities in all country's,,,

Underated channel, also I have been meaning to try something over the summer, and I stumbled upon this video, thanks and you are going to get far in life

Are you a college student?

Nice work!

好酷

Will you please upload the  3rd printer model

Try your best and best of luck

What design software do you use?

مينفع تقول البرامج المستخدمه

You are the first one to explain so deeply keep it up

Nice work bro🔥🔥

Could you please share the code part-1 of the video. Nice job!

I imagine if this robot can Ctrl.of cellphone and it works in Bluetooth 😆 I'm bad on coding so I try some basic parts 😂

Amei seu projeto 😁😁 Brazil

What 3D design program do you use? Is it free?

Hey, it's 9.4 kg/cm @ 4.8V!

fusion 360 he said i think

Thank you for the kind words! Wish you all the best in your project!

Fusion 360

Thank you for the kind words!

Sugar

I used Fusion 360, it is free for students and hobbyists. :)

could you send a cuircit diagram too

how link MpU5060 gyro + PCA9685 servo dispatch..?? all use A4 A5 pin

hi can u share 3d prints files!

thank you very much for the knowledge nic! yeah i do love spot very much, and i learn robotics to make a micro spot. this video such a gold! keep up the goodwork!

NIce!! can i use ESP 32  instead  Arduino + Servo board or it must include servo board(16pin) ??  Thank you

Can we use the linkit 7697 for this project

No damper on foot Passive sprinx or the dynamic one were used there lol

Very impressive ! Great to see other Malaysian students doing wonderful projects ! Keep up the good work !

Great work!!! You just earned a Sub👍🏻

This is truly amazing stuff!

Very large surface area brain good stuff

ah!!!   can u share the codes if u dont mind i was struck there i really need ur help.....

good video man

Hi, I am a beginner, and I want a dog so... Robot dog!!!! But i want to know if i could use a Raspberry Pi 3b+???????????????????''

Damn boii the viewssssss!! I didnt understand shit but it was really entertaining to watch!!

That is very good idea

I've always wanted to learn this stuff. You have a new suscriber

Very good 😀👍🏻👍🏻

Pretty amazing a love how you explained it. Very well done.. Cant wait to see more. I currently 3d printing a design. I will have all body hardware done soon. Im looking for tutorials like this one to help me understand. Not to copy or have someone else do it and just download code. Great job.

Thank you for sharing

Hi, we can connect multiple I2C devices through pin A4 and A5.

Thanks for the kind words!

Since esp32 has 16 pwm channels, you can use it without the servo board. Remember to power up your servos externally tho.

@NicAqueous   Thank you so much !!!

Hi, I have no experience with linkit 7697, but seeing it has 18 PWM pins you can most definitely use it to do this project without needing the servo motor driver. Make sure to still power your servo motors externally tho.

Thank you!

Thanks! You've got a great channel going on as well. :D

Funniest comment I've read. Thanks!

You can find it in my second video of the series. A more optimized code will be posted together with my new robot dog in the future. Stay tuned! :)

Yes, you should be able to use a rasp pi.

@NicAqueous  Ok thanks...

Thanks haha, glad you enjoyed!

Thanks! Good luck on your project too!

this is great! is this an open source project? If it is, where could I find the 3d print files for the dog body?

Great!Hugs from brazil

hey Nic, this is real cool.    You pushed me into working on my own.    Would love to see your code or designs-  Do you plan on sharing?

great job!!....waiting 4 your second part.....thumb up!

Cool video, I would love to use your STL files and Software to build my own one. Maybe you can Share your files :)

Thank you everyone for your support! Been dealing with studies lately but part 2 will be out soon this month! Can't wait to show you all the progress, stay tuned! ;)

good job,  I looooved it

what course you take for fusion  360

I'm looking forward to part 2.

Oh yeah, count me subscribed!

Sweet dude! Nice job!!

I'm waiting next episod.

From where did you learn all these technical terms and concepts,was it all curiosity driven google searches, reading books or are/were you enrolled in a formal degree course which provides knowledge in this realm? Really loved the work.

Please share the code, it will help me a lot to understand this , I’m working on same project with almost same sort of calculations , I’m a beginner ........thanks

very cool :), did you print the leg ? thanks

I dont know if you read my comments, but consider some kind of sensors to feel "im touching the ground", just like your own legs or hands do. With that you would make the walk much more fluid.

amazing bro! cant wait to watch more of your videos!😍

But the look is ugly.. Not aesthetic..

Awesome work, Nic! We'd love to chat! What's the best way to reach you?

Great video! Subscribed :)

Thanks! Yes it will be. However, there are some flaws in the design at the moment. I will release the files once I'm happy with everything. :)

Thanks, and yes I plan to share everything once the project is completed!

@NicAqueous  excellent-   I look forward to watching your progress....

I'll make everything open source once the project is completed. Stay tuned! ;)

theta = 3.1412 - C; why you did that?? can't understand!

I learned it through youtube.

Thanks! I'm currently pursuing a degree in electrical and electronics engineering, so there are some relations between what I'm doing and studying. However, most of what I've learned were indeed through curiosity driven google searches.

Sure thing! I will share everything online once the project is completed, stay tuned!

Thanks, yes I did. :)

@NicAqueous  Can I get the leg files ? thanks

@Bianchi77  I plan to share everything online once the project is done, so stay tuned!

Would definitely do that in the future!

Wow, thanks! You can reach me through my email nic.aqs98@gmail.com

@NicAqueous  thanks for email bro

Hi Nic, Nice job, and well explained :)  Keep going.

Nice video! But I think you should work on your audio cause your voice is quite soft

Make it bark🐶😗

can your dog play fetch? :)

add.. weapons

Cooollll!

rainbow edit on point LMAOOO

Looks awesome! Didn't know what you mentioned but love the outcome! Keep up the good work! So proud of you!

Didn’t get a single thing in this video but you’re cool and the doggo is cool too hahah! Nice one Nic!🤩

Selangor Dynamics

Nic Aqueous IS BACKKKKKKKK

Gengggg

Damn...  Not the first one to comment

😍👍🏻

Probably need to make it a jaw for that haha

Oh god andrew.. 😂😂

Hahaha thanks Gina!
