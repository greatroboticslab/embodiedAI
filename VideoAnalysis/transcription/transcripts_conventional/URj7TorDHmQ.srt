00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
How's it going everybody this is Nick from Part-Time Pilot. Today's video is

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,680
going to be on lift. A very important video for pilots to understand. You got to

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,200
know how your aircraft creates lift so that you can maintain it in all

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,160
situations. I just want to mention that I'm giving out a free study guide for

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:19,920
the FAA Private Pilot Written. It's over 170 slides long. It's really great. A lot

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,320
of good information. Just look at the link in my description. Go to that link

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,500
and download the study guide for free. All you need to do is put in your email.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,540
Alright, let's get started. Okay, so lift. Lift. There's a lot of different

9
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:36,440
explanations out there for lift. The truth is it's a little complicated and

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,920
there's multiple contributions to lift. So there's multiple explanations that

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,840
combine to create the force of lift. Let's get to them. The first one is

12
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,820
Newton's Third Law. I'm sure you've heard of it, but if not, for every action there's

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,520
an equal and opposite reaction. Okay, a classic example of this is let's say

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,600
you're standing on a little boat by a dock and you're jumping out of the boat.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,260
You're pushing off the boat to get onto the dock. As you step off and push

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,260
yourself off to get onto the dock, the boat moves away from you. So your action is

17
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,260
pushing off to get onto the dock. The reaction is the boat moving away from you.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,220
That's why you see a lot of people fall into the water when they're trying to get

19
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:20,920
on a dock. Okay, for aircraft, the perfect example is thrust and forward

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,920
movement of the aircraft. The propeller spins through the air and essentially

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,920
pushes the air backward with the resulting motion of the aircraft moving

22
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,000
forward. Okay, also another good example is a rocket engine. This is actually a very

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,060
clear example. That's why I chose it for the visualization. So in our rocket nozzle,

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:48,000
so here's our rocket, we have a bunch of fuel in here. Okay, the fuel is mixed and it's

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
burned and it's thrown out of the rocket at very high speeds. All right. Now what

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,320
that does, so you have an action throwing out masses of burnt fuel propellant and you

27
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,000
have a reaction of the engine that's attached to the rocket propelling forward.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,840
That's Newton's third law as it pertains to aerospace vehicles and even airplanes

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,080
with a common propeller. The second contribution to lift I want to talk about is described

30
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,940
by Bernoulli's principle. So Bernoulli's principle is a mathematical principle that relates the

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,440
pressure of a moving fluid with its velocity. What it says is that as the velocity of a fluid

32
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,540
increases, the pressure of that fluid decreases and vice versa. So if the velocity decreases,

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:47,540
the pressure would increase. For airplanes, this fluid is air. A fluid is a gas or liquid.

34
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,300
So for airplanes, this is air. So what does this equation look like? So essentially,

35
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,380
it's a combination of the static pressure plus the dynamic pressure equaling the total pressure,

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,320
which remains constant. So imagine the total pressure remaining constant. So you have the

37
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,000
static pressure plus the dynamic pressure, which is a constant. Now, if you want to know the

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,660
differences between static pressure and dynamic pressure, click on the video that's popping up

39
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,600
in the top right. I go over the differences between that and how your aircraft instruments

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:27,320
use those values. So you have the static pressure plus the dynamic pressure, which is a function of

41
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:34,360
the velocity. So it's the density of the air times the velocity squared of the air divided by two. But for

42
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:42,460
now, just know static pressure plus dynamic pressure equals total pressure, which is a constant.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,180
Okay, so if this is constant all the time, that means it's always the same. Let's say it's 10.

44
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:59,560
And the static pressure, let's say is, we'll say the static pressure is five. Okay, that makes the

45
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,100
dynamic pressure five, five plus five equals 10. Now if this, because this is constant, it can't change

46
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:13,700
from 10. And let's say the static pressure were to change or to go up to eight. What does that mean

47
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,400
that this term, the dynamic pressure has to do? It has to go down for this to equal 10. It can't be

48
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,100
five anymore. It can't go up. That would be more than 10. It has to be two. Okay, so it went down.

49
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,120
What's happening here is the velocity is going down. The density of the air is not changing,

50
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:38,780
mostly. It's usually staying the same. So the velocity is going down. So how does this look? Let's

51
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:47,140
look at this more visually. So here we have a hypothetical nozzle where we have an area of A1 here

52
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:57,700
with air entering at velocity V1 and pressure P1. Okay, so this is station one.

53
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:10,340
As the air flows through here, it gets constricted by the area of the nozzle at station two. So

54
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:19,380
the area cross-sectional area at station two is smaller than area one. This causes the velocity

55
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:27,880
to increase. So V2 is higher than V1. Now, according to Bernoulli, what happens when the velocity

56
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:37,260
increases? The pressure decreases. So P2 is smaller than P1. Okay, so how does all this, how does Newton

57
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:44,380
and Bernoulli, how does this explain a propeller aircraft creating lift? Let's get into that. So here

58
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:50,380
we have a picture of an airfoil. So this is the brown shape here in our picture. The airfoil is a

59
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:58,240
cross-sectional shape of our wing. We have this airfoil at an angle of attack between the free

60
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:07,100
streamline here and the cord line here. So angle of attack. Now as the air approaches this wing,

61
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,560
it splits. Some of the air goes below the wing and some of the air travels above the wing.

62
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,660
The first contribution to lift, the air below the wing, so we're talking about this blue line here,

63
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,660
changes direction due to the positive angle of attack of the wing. So it comes in,

64
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:33,140
it hits the wing, but because the wing's at a positive angle of attack, it bounces off the wing

65
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,280
and travels along the bottom of the wing. This change in direction, according to Newton,

66
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:47,780
has an opposite reaction on the wing itself. So it pushes the wing this way. So the resulting motion

67
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:55,540
is this way, but this has a vertical component as well as a horizontal component. But this vertical

68
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:04,240
component, we relate to lift. The second contribution to lift, the air traveling above the wing,

69
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,660
so now we're talking about this green line here, the air traveling above the wing is also turned

70
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:18,000
and follows the curve shape of the airfoil. So it turns and follows this shape, finally traveling

71
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,680
down by the end of the wing. So at the trailing edge of the wing, it's now pointing downwards.

72
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,920
This change of direction downwards has an opposite reaction according to Newton's third law. So the

73
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:41,300
opposite reaction of the wing would be this way, which again has a vertical component as well as a

74
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:49,720
horizontal component, but this vertical component relates to lift. Again, described by Newton's third

75
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:57,520
law. The third and final contribution to lift can be described by Bernoulli's principle. It gets a

76
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,560
little tough, so hang with me. So the air above and below the wing are at different pressures. To explain

77
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,020
how they got to different pressures, we have, let's think about them individually. The air above the wing,

78
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,660
it has a lower pressure because the front of the wing is blocking it from oncoming air. So we're talking

79
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:26,160
about the air right back here. The oncoming air is coming in and it's getting blocked by the front

80
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,700
of the wing such that the air back here does not feel that dynamic pressure of the air. Think about

81
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:40,960
you're riding on a motorcycle behind a very big guy, you're hanging onto his stomach and you don't feel

82
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,600
it's nice back there because you don't feel any of that dynamic pressure of the air coming and hitting

83
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,820
you in the face. Okay, so this is what's happening at the top of the wing. So the pressure is lower than

84
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,220
the bottom of the wing that doesn't have that protection of the wing. So it's getting the full

85
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,840
force of air hitting it on the bottom of the wing. So now we have the pressure below

86
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:17,920
the wing is greater than the pressure above the wing. Now Bernoulli also told us that the pressure,

87
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,460
when the pressure goes down, the velocity goes up. So the air above is also traveling faster now

88
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,340
because the pressure is going down. But what we really care about is this pressure differential.

89
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:40,500
So P above, okay, and P below, we know that P above is lower. We also know that a fluid wants to,

90
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:49,080
it wants to find equilibrium in a volume. Okay, so if you put a bunch of fluid out of a balloon,

91
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:58,200
it's going to disperse itself into, into the room evenly. So you have high pressure below the wing,

92
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,960
but you have low pressure above the wing. The air wants to get to that low pressure and find

93
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:14,760
equilibrium. So what happens is there's almost a vacuum effect around the leading edge of the wing

94
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:23,560
of air trying to get to that low pressure area. This has the effect, overall effect of the higher

95
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:31,700
pressure from the bottom of the wing, pushing up on the wing and creating a vertical component of lift.

96
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:37,640
So that is how Newton and Bernoulli help us explain lift on an aircraft. It's all about the shape of the

97
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,340
wing, the airfoil and the angle of attack, splitting the air, causing that differential in pressure,

98
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:49,500
creating both forces from Newton and Bernoulli and that net force upwards of lift.
