In this video, I am going to talk about RLC filters.\nAfter watching this video, you will find answers to many questions around this subject.\nIn this video, you will see one of the most beautiful and important applications of inductors\nin electronics, I mean in practical circuits.

Some newbies may think that\nthose signals are placed in separate frequency bands, so they exist on air separately and independently.\nBut this is not completely true. They are not separated. Frequency bands are abstract concepts.\nThey are not truly separated. Surprisingly, all those radio stations, TV broadcastings,\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth signals, RF remote controller signals, radio transceiver signals, and many other signals\nare mixed and form an integrated, blended and complicated signal. There is only one signal on air.\nI know, it is confusing. I want to do a simple experiment to demonstrate what I tried to say.\nI have generated these two signals using my function generator. Let's suppose that these two are radio\nsignals from different radio stations broadcast at different frequencies. It's obvious that the",

I am going to apply these two signals here to points A and B to see what will happen at point C.\nLook here. This trace is the result at point C. When two signals exist in the same medium,\nthey will be added and form a new signal. Look here.\nLook here. This is the signal at point A. And this is the signal at point B. And this yellow trace is the result at point C.\nTwo signals in previous experiments were not an exception. This is a general rule. When two or more signals share the same medium,\neither the air or a wire, they will mix and form a new signal, usually very complex signal. In real-world applications, unwanted signals are added to signals too.\nThe radio antenna captures only one signal, which consists of all of those signals at once.

A filter is actually a pathway circuit that blocks specific frequencies and allows others to pass.\nSo, RLC filters are one of them, actually the most simple ones.\nIn RLC filters, R stands for resistor, L stands for inductor, and C stands for capacitor.\nSo, RLC filters are made up of resistors, inductors, and capacitors.\nThis circuit filters high frequency and allows low frequency to pass to point E, and this circuit filters low frequency and allows high frequency to pass to point F.\nThe frequency of the signal at point F.\nThe frequency of the signal at point F is 1 kHz and the frequency of the signal at point F is 15 kHz.\nI want to apply this yellow trace to input of these two filters and probe points E and F.\nSo, RLC filters are one of them, which is the most important ones.\nLook here, when I probe the point E, this blue trace, I mean, you see the first signal is here and the second signal, the high frequency signal, is filtered.\nThere is only the first low frequency signal at point E.\nAnd when I probe the point F, you see there is only the second signal here and the first signal is filtered.\nI know you may have questions in mind about these circuits, I mean, this one and this one, particularly about the values of the capacitors and inductors.\nWhy did I use these specific values?",
