permission to use the song plsssss

song

Lukes please guide me how can i can set it up and test the code you have uploaded on github. I have pi 3B+ and arduino mega. You have only proveded arduino code

you definitely can tell you're and aspiring engineer and not a gardener :) grass has seen better days

This is very cool. Have you already tried using a PS4 controller to maneuver the rover? That simplifies the steering and opens up opportunities for more features like toggling in thermal or infrared imaging. There are a lot of cool things to do with a project like this. I wish I had seen this video sooner!

Need tutorial 🤩🤩

Good job man. I'm interested in this project now..

Sehr gut!!!

#EPIC  Now make it 5 times bigger, of metal and put an airmchair on the top so you can ride it

Dud this is awesome. Keep going at it. Going to be building your clock next month.

music from suno right ?

are you using any kind of bearings to avoid friction between parts? and are how are you keeping the screws fastened properly at rotating parts like the "differential" gear? nyloc nuts?

Good Work.

What all technical stuff does one need to know to build such a rover?

You will go big in future❤ best wishes 🎉

i love the AI generated background music lol

do it harder,.. add SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) into the system ,.. then do autonomous path driving,..

@wildwillyrobots

Hello @LukasDeem, is there a platform where I can connect with you and the audience? Also, how can I get updates? Please make one

so much good stuff in this video - glad I found ya !

Haha well the grass dies here in the winter 🤣. It's looking much better now!

Hey! Yes I can't wait to make it remote controlled 😁😁

I would check out the videos that Wild Willy Robots put out!

Hey thanks! It was a fun one for sure!

Haha the dream!

Hey thanks! Hopefully you have better luck figuring out how to power that clock than I did 😅😅. I would suggest you read through the comments on that video there were tons of good suggestions on how to improve the design.

Correct

No bearings, and yes I used some nylock nuts. This design would eventually wear after extended use, but I doubt I will ever run it enough for that to become a problem.

Thank you!

So I started with some smaller electronics projects, then learned 3D printing, and lastly did some robotics projects that required coding before tackling this one. I used python, html, css, and C++ to make it work. I also used GitHub to maintain version control. Lastly, I used chat GPT to help me write code and debug.

Wow thank you so much!! 😁

Haha thanks! I had fun with it ♥️

Yes! I want to do that. Do I need lidar for that?

@LukasDeem  u can use cheaper option like ultrasound,.. but it won't be suitable outdoor,.. i found VL53L0X is quite cheap for lidar,.. but u had to built your own rotating scan device,..

Hey thanks I appreciate it!! I have a few more videos in the works right now! 😃

Next add a drone that charges off your rover and can fly around and land back on it so it can do it multiple times. After that, send the whle thing to Mars. /s. Very impressive project. Fun to watch.

SO GORGEOUS

hey there i wanted to ask that did you program rover using ros

Hi If You don't mind can you please tell like how much you spent on building the chasis or printing those parts.

Never seen this channel before,i think youtube is wildly recommending this vedio,The number of  veiw of this vedio is going to sky 🚀. Anyway i like the each theme song of each section,made it something unique.

Great tutorial! I'm a beginner in robotics and this video helped me understand how to integrate Raspberry Pi and Arduino. Thanks for sharing your knowledge!

damn bro! thats amazing :D much better than buying spot tbh

This is going to be my college project but with major changes 😅❤

Well done !!  😀

Hey bro! What a amazing project! I'm trying to do something similar, but I have issues to connect the camera with the UI using flask. I did it with HTTP server and it works so god but when I tried to send other instructions with key inputs the server crashed. Could you give me more info about the camera coding please? Once again amazing work!

What software are you using to make those animations for the micro controllers?

what a great video, what a video editor to make an animation on video section 01.35 (Electronic plan) ?

totally awesome, i love the way you go at your project and succeed in completing it; i would give an arm and a leg for someone like you to join me in my project (building a solar powered sustainable low maintenance houseboat that will be open sourced - shamelessly inserted my own project here hehe)

This video made me feel so happy for you!

The custom robot soundtrack though!  :D Well done.  I'm also a fan of Wild Willy.  Perhaps I'll follow in your "footsteps."

Amazing! I'm trying to do a robotic arm myself! Maybe later we fuse a hand and wheels later! lol

wow, great work. How many days you spent on this project?

Just a question, would not sourcing 12v motors of similar rpm not have been easier than having the buck converter?  It's pretty much just comes down to the windings arrangements inside the motor itself at the end of the day..  With using the increased voltage, your amp draw would be lowered also, so may even be able to get away with smaller H bridge boards.

Hi, I've been following videos on DIY Rover and I made a car myself. wildwillyrobots' car is very good and its design is beautiful. I noticed that a long time ago. But I think it has a defect, the axle of the wheel passes through the rocker arm and is connected with the steering gear fixed in the rocker arm, which makes me doubt its strength, after all, this is 3D printed, I want this car to have a certain strength, I wonder if you have any ideas on this aspect during the development process?

The musicccccc is a nice touch

Haha now that would be awesome 😎

What is ros? 😅

@LukasDeem  robot operating system

@LukasDeem  I am  a robotics engineer and I suggest is you to make this complete autonomous using ros 2

Hey thanks so much! I'm doing my best to make interesting stuff🤠

Hey of course! Glad I could help 😃😃

Haha thanks 🤠

Hey! What kind of changes are you planning?

Thank you!

Hey! So I ran two servers to make my project work. One was the flask server that hosted the rover controls. The other was the server that comes with the RPi camera repo. I just ran both and pulled the camera stream over into my control website 😅

Very helpful!! Many thanks!

I used Adobe after effects 🙃

I used Adobe after effects! It took me two or three nights to do it 🤣

Hey thanks so much!!! It's the biggest project I've taken on yet 🤣

Hey thanks!! Do it! He has some other awesome projects on his page as well!

Haha let's do it!

So it took me 2 months but I'm also working full time and finishing grad school 😅😅

Yes 100%. I wanted to follow the instructions posted by Wild Willy, however now in retrospect this would have been a good adjustment 😅

Hey thanks a ton! 🤠🤠

And NOW you need a 360 degree camera...

I was trying to gather details but there were not such videos related to how to make rover yours is a walllaaaaahhh loved it thankyou so much will try it now

Great project :) which 3d design software do you use?

love the music! 😂

sick! playing this for my students now! Thank you : )

ill try to build one, using pipes coz i don't have 3d printer hahahah.. thanks for the idea!

Top!!! Thanks!!!!

Xlnt...we are building something similar for agri...loved the work and ur diligence! 👍

Maaan this was soo cool!! As a recent Robotics engineering graduate,  I think you're already an engineer even though you don't consider yourself as one yet.

Nice how you have every music for every section of the video 🎉😊❤

Super bro,can you send the music link

came for the rover, stayed for the music

Great project and great video!  Any reason you went wifi instead of bluetooth?  I imagine hooking up a BT controller would be easier than bringing a laptop and a router outside

Just an excellent work 🎉

man who is incharge of those Songs? did you sing or play as well?

This is pure joy ♥♥♥♥♥😀👌

As an aspired robotic engineer, I love this so much especially the designs, wireless controls and also the music🤩. If it is possible could we work together on the next project of yours. I noticed you faced issues with space. I could handle the PCB designing part of the next upcoming project so we get rid of those cables flying around. I will be glad to connect with you. I love working on real world problems.

Awesome video. The audio quality and video quality were very nice. Keep it up!!

Your content is great, I'm an engineering and design student, and it's cool to see something like that.😊., by the way, I love the music background at the end... You convinced me with that...😂🤣

First time I've seen someone use AI music for background music. Such a great way to apply it

Yep I'm just looking for an excuse to get one 🤣

Hey! I'm glad I could help! Make sure you check out Wild Willy robotics Assembly video that helped me a ton.

So this design wasn't mine. It was done by Wild Willy Robots I linked him in the description. You should check out his videos he makes really cool stuff. He might have brought it up in one of his videos what software he uses 😅

@LukasDeem  thank you 😊

Thank you I used an AI tool! Suno.com

Hey that's awesome just be aware that there are some censored cuss words in it 😅😅

I thought it would be cool to build a larger Rover using carbon fiber tubes 🤠

Hey I appreciate it! 😎

Hey thanks so much! What kind of applications are you attending to use yours for?

@LukasDeem  Mailed you.

Hey thanks so much! I feel like Im missing some fundamentals such as the math behind how to design safe and strong structures for example.

Hey thanks so much!!! I had a lot of fun using suno.com 🙃

Hey I just made it using suno.com it's an AI music generator 😎

Ayyyyy! Thanks I'm glad you like it honestly when I was making the video I thought I might have overdone it a little bit 😅

@LukasDeem  Naah, it's perfect. Awesome job sir.

Totally agree and it's something I want to do in the next one. The reason why I did it over the internet on this one was because I wanted to give remote control to someone who's not physically located nearby. I ended up cutting that from scope

Thanks I really appreciate it!!! 😁

Hey! I wish! I used an AI tool called suno.com let me put in my own lyrics and I made songs for me. It's a super cool tool to check it out 😎

Ayyyy! Thanks so much! 😃

Thanks so much I just replied to your email. 💯💯💯

Hey thanks a ton I really appreciate it!

Hey thanks so much! I almost published the video with just me saying hey I'd appreciate it if you subscribe. Then I realize I was missing a huge opportunity and made a custom song about it 🙃🙃🙃

Hey thanks I appreciate it so much! As soon as I heard about that tool I knew exactly what I had to do. 😺

lol i am build something very similar but it is autonomous and i am still in middle school  .

the production value in this video was insane, keep up the great work

What a work of art, amazing

Your Ai generated music is really really cool

AI generated music?

Awesome work

sir  you can use Seed Studios  "AI Vision Module V2 " camera module ,it has  higher frame_Rate and nearly no latency

Wow, just wow!

I'm about 30 seconds in and subscribed! I've been working on robots for fun for years now but never done a serious project like this. I also love all of the Mars rover footage (one of the two things that got me into tech and robotics in the first place), so I'm excited to see the rest of this!

Can I please know how do you manage the encoders for six motors in one microcontroller Arduino Mega?

How would you even go about learning how to do this or start a smaller project like this

Great video and very inspiring. Did those songs come from suno? 😆

This is awesome. Love the music ☺️😂.. how long did the project take

Its really lovely to see the work  & effort put into a job finally work. amazing video 👌

its great watching your project come to fruition, can this be used for something useful like mowing grass or spread weedcontroller etc.

Nice project but it would be more fun to use if you have made better controllers for it. To give you an idea, I once added some javascript to esp (it is raspberry in your case) hosted website to access to js gamepad api, then i connected my gamepad to my laptop and than I was able to use my car like I was driving a car in a video game with controller.

This is great, honestly I love this so much and I'm looking forward to creating a rover has cool as yours 🔥💯

girl with down syndrome? just asking

Absolutely smashing.  I had a dream to build a rover-like vehicle. Not as sophisticated as yours perhaps but nonetheless... However, my dream didn't stop there...  The rover was going to be dropped from a large drone after flying for 5 or so miles out of sight up to an altitude of 1800ft to a nearby hill where I used to live.  This was as close as I could get to living out my childhood dreams of taking part in a Mars mission.  Then the powers that be killed drones flying out of sight stone dead.  That was the end of that!

So cool. 🎉

love to see other rover project

Hey that's awesome you should post a video of it once you have it done!!

This is literally the best compliment 😸. I put a lot of time into this one 😎

Wow thanks I really appreciate it! 😄

Thanks so much I had a little bit too much fun playing around with it 🤠🤠

Yep! I used suno.com

Thank so you much!

Hey thanks so much!! ☺️☺️

Ayyy! I appreciate it! I feel the same way. As a kid I was so inspired by the rover projects 🤣🤣.

So the mega offers enough pins to support them all. The only caveat here is that I was one interrupt pin short. However you can run PID algorithms without interrupts, they are just less accurate. In order to get the video done I actually didn't end up using the encoders. The are all wired up in case I change my mind!

Hey I saw your DM and replied! I'm thinking I may make a video about how to get started for beginners 🤣

Hey thanks! Yes I used suno.com 🤠🤠

It took me about two months, but I had to take breaks in between since I'm finishing school 😸

@LukasDeem  wow

Hey thanks a time this one was definitely a challenge for me 🤣

I would love to have a weed whacking robot that's actually hilarious and something I might have to do now 🤣🤣🤣🤣

So I didn't include it in the video but I attempted to get it working with my Xbox controller 😄. I wasn't able to get good results so I stuck with keyboard control. I'm determined to get it working next time. Thanks for the tips!!! 🫡

Ayy! Thanks so much 😎😎

Hey thats awesome! I wonder if you could just control the drone from near that hill so that you're still technically in line of sight so that you can do this cuz this is awesome 🤠🤠

Hey thanks!! 🙃

Dude u are totally an engineer, great work, loved it

As an engineering student, watching this was a joy!

Suggestion  You could add led to know standby , boot up and off mode Power button would be better outside  And probably a charge port too Have you considered RF,I'd like to see that too

Thank god i've been into microcontrollers and IoT lately, I came across this wonderful gem of a channel as a result. How are you doing the songs? Are they original pieces? It's so funny to observe the background music. Had me do double takes so many times! 😂

So much complication for  the poor quality camera, I would just put a phone in it and video call from other phone to see remotely

3:48 Node red - with ui, and can put out pwm

Can I get a link to your audio playlist they are very coooll...didnt know there where songs about robots😂😂

Hey, I'm a high school student who's an expert at designing robots and rockets. I strongly suggest that you take on a fin-guided rocket project, which I can help you with by providing the code and CAD. Trust me, it will be a challenging and rewarding project.

Can i use a camera with a VTX to access the live video .If yes, can you tell me how??

Cool video... Apart from the awful AI Music.

This is so GOOD!

I wish to be engineer one day and proceeds with the engineering

Nice project and great job on the video

really great job

Cybertruck 2.0 lookin fire 🔥🔥🔥

When a 3D printed rover can crab walk better than a cybertruck, lol but thisbis grest project!

Fantastic video and project! Amazing job! I was checking the links to the parts, and the second and third links seem broken. Can you take a look?! Thanks!

Enjoyed the vid. Those L298N motor drivers are antiques though, should have gone for something much smaller!

Could you have just used a full sized Raspberry pi instead of a Pi Zero + Arduino?

Hi this  is nice and cool project, actually i am thinking to start a similar project but to. Code do i need ros , linux system or can i do this with windows laptop

Oh wow thanks! 😄😄

Ayyy! I think you are my target audience lol 🤣.

Which type of Engineer you are?

Yes I totally need to add a power switch to this thing so I don't have to use a screwdriver to start it 🤣🤣🤣

Ayyyy! Thanks so much! I used suno.ai I'm actually going to post a video about it soon 🫡

@LukasDeem  Oh right on! What a wonderful channel you have here. Thanks for making such fun content.

@Roxomus  thanks so much!! I'm having fun connecting with the community and making projects 🙂🙂

Haha true, I was a little strapped for space though 🤣. Anyway I did it this way so I could learn more about Raspberry pi 🫡

@LukasDeem  That's very good. Now I envision & accept your perspective about learning!. I was only thinking about practicality before.

i dont get why use the atmega board you can control evriting with raspi gpio, ok add some opto cupler.

9 :13 Rocker-bogie big plus

11:26 160 camera best , but why not a plexy cover ?

16:10 cool build but the problem is a insaide robot so it does not really need the Rocker-bogie , mechanum would be better, sorry if I appear bet roude but eng is not my first lang , and I do this professionally so I am looking from ivory tower.

Hey thanks so much for your feedback I really appreciate it. Many of the choices that I made on this project were just about me learning something for example I wanted to connect a raspberry Pi and Arduino together just to see if I can do it. Same story with the rocker boogie suspension I was just really interested in learning more about it 🤠

Hey! So I made the songs custom with suno.ai 🤣🤣

Oohh okkk cool😂😂  I will check it out

By Fin guided, I'm assuming you are meaning that the fins are articulated by motors to control the trajectory of the rocket?

@LukasDeem  yup that's right fins control using the servo motor. That's a interesting project.

Hey, I'm a general multi-language developer and would love to learn more about the algorithms of these fields. Any open-source links to these type of projects would be gr8 to review and study the algorithm

I don't know what a VTX is 😅

@LukasDeem  it is a video transmitter.

This is used in FPV drones to transmit live video to the receiver.

@AkashMaharana-kf7jb  ah I see. I don't see why you couldn't do it 🤷

@LukasDeem  i am just asking whether i can use this or not for video transmission???

@AkashMaharana-kf7jb  I have no idea sorry ! This would require some research 😅

@LukasDeem  ok., thanks 🙏🏼

Haha it's certainly not for everyone 🤣

Oh hey PCBWay! This project is a prime candidate for a PCB, I'm planning to learn how to create my own soon! 🫡

@LukasDeem  Get the ball rolling, Lukas!! We just can’t wait to see your next one!

Haha well I studied sociology and business in school. I wish I would have studied engineering. At this point in my life it would be difficult to go to a 4-year program and engineering. Haven't really found any good options for nights and weekends engineering schools since I work full-time. 😅

@LukasDeem  your system in america is weird us in south Africa if you know the job you can just ask to write the exam to get the certificate but from what you know already you are advanced bro  Plus is there a way too connect the rover via cellular network for long distance control

@Carlosbnker  oh wow! Yeah it's a time consuming and expensive process here 😸. I agree! I think making it controlled over cell would be so cool!

@LukasDeem  yeah that will be so cool, i know I'm over my head but imagine that rover with a solar panel and a system to find water in the desert spring water is on the demand these days with it giving gps locations of it finding you can easily sell the locations, well i like thinking business my bad

@Carlosbnker  that's a super cool idea! I've actually seen a YT video where someone made an infinite range rover with solar!

@LukasDeem  is it😅 I'll take a look.But great stuff chief waiting for your next project

Hey thanks so much! 😄

Thank you! 😃

Ayyyy!

Haha good call out! I updated my thumbnail to show off the crab mode feature :-P

The links are working now; maybe my bad. Thanks again for sharing these :)

Oh perfect! Thanks for letting me know :)

Haha they did feel unnecessarily large :P

After reading these comments, I'm thinking yes 🤣

So you can write all the code on your PC. I used VS code and GitHub.

Could you say a bit more about how you distributed the power supply? I understand that the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and motors are powered by a Lipo Battery through a DC Buck Converter?

This rover looks fantastic, great job! Looking forward to you next projects. But why did you use the Arduino Mega if you wanted to use a Raspberry PI? Any model from 3B could solve this task on its own, they got enough GPIOs for that purpose. Or do I miss something?.. Also if you get a good enough internet on the rover, with a little extra work you can attach a usual web-camera and have hq video with low latency using V4L. Let me know if you're interested, I can share the solution. (I was a little disappointed with the quality of PI camera so found a better option)

This is awesome! I need to try this!

I'm feeling so excited watching this video

When you started this project, you made up your mind about including a raspberry pi and camera. You found good success in creating a network controlled wireless rover with a live camera feed. However, I should say that most of everything you accomplished here could have been done without the use of a raspberry pi. You mentioned that the controls were quite laggy, which is an inherent problem of exchanging data over a network. By either using a bluetooth capable game controller with the appropriate arduino shield, or an RC controller with the appropriate receiver, you would be able to achieve 0 latency control with multiple miles of range (if using RC hardware that runs ELRS). The use of a network for control here comes at the cost of range and latency, and a less than ideal control interface (your hardware is capable of it, but can you get granular control inputs with a keyboard?) I figure that the reason you wanted to use a raspberry pi and camera in the first place is to challenge yourself. So, after all I've said, I challenge you take it a step forward. Firstly, that raspberry pi is a powerful computer and right now most of that processing power is going unutilized. You should create an autonomous mode for the rover. Use the camera and raspberry pi to implement some basic image recognition and obstacle detection / avoidance. The goal is autonomy. You said the coding part of this project was easier than you expected, this will be a challenge. Secondly, and still in service of the goal of the autonomy, you can ditch the wifi communication in favor of cellular. There are cellular modules for raspberry pi available for sale, and having one would give you effectively infinite range. Next, incorporate a GPS / compass module into the rover, so that it can be aware of its own position at all times and be able autonomously complete waypoint missions. Lastly, and perhaps the most extra suggestion, is using an FPV grade video system in order to get a 0 latency video feed. Just look up "digital FPV kit" if you're curious (The caveat would be the video transmission will run on completely independent hardware to the rest of the rover. Alright, them's my thoughts, good work mate.

amazing video. subbed!!

The video is awesome, but i would have used a Maker Pi, as is easier to integrate.. and is made for robotics..

Great job with the rover and the music!  I'm building a different version with the rocker-bogie design similar to yours except there are only 6 motors - the wheels don't turn like yours.  I have to admit the coding is kicking my butt, good for you to get through that.  I'm using an ESP32 camera module, Arduino Uno and laptop with a python client.  The Serial communications between the Uno and ESP32 is the hardest part of the whole project so far.

Great work, from one hacker to another.🤖

Cool! Next up: Analogue controls (looks like everything's on/off now) and then, integration, a single board to rule it all :) PS: And LoRa(WAN), so that you can save some power and increase the transmission distance quite a bit

Beautiful rover. Nicely done 👍🏾✅

im extremely new to electronics and am confused about how your controlling the rover through a html website when your in a park where im assuming theres no internet connection?

The Robot Friend song is hilariously great.  Nice project.

Great Job! thanks for being transparent about the mechanical design coming from WildWilly

Project  is cool ,amazing  and fantastic one ......big up , am a robotic lover

Sweet!

i have an idea ! why don't you build a solar zipline that works remotely

So inspiring Thank you.   But what’s that song??  Amazing song choice for the video.

why are you using the arduino to move the other electronics and not the pi it self?

MAN, the algorithm has been bringing some good stuff recently. Really love how many creators are starting to use their own original music. Absolute banger video!

Yep so I use the buck converter to drop the voltage down to 6 volts. Then I took that output and tied it into a prototyping board where I just took over a power rail on the side of the prototyping board to distribute the 6 volts. I soldered the motor power wires directly to that power rail. I'm sure there's a bad a million ways to do this better but this is how I did it 🤣

@LukasDeem  Thank you!

So I was worried the pi didn't have enough gpio pins. I was also thinking that it would take too much computational power to run a PID algorithm for the wheels (which I ended up cutting from scope) and the web server for the Rover control. The pi cam quality was actually good enough for me, I just wish it was a wider angle 🙃

@LukasDeem  PI got 28 GPIOs if you don't need other interfaces like I2C or UART. And computational power greatly exceeds that of an Arduino :)

@LightRobotics  so if I leave off the encoders I would have enough. Originally I was trying to use the encoder so I could implement a PID algorithm. If I use the encoders the servo motors and the DC motor driver boards I think it would end up being about 30 pins required. However I decided not to use the PID control algorithm so in theory I could have used just a pi I guess 🤣🤣

Go for it! The design of the rover provided by wild Willy is great! The electronics choices I made leave room for improvement 🙃

Ayyy! I'm glad you are enjoying! ☺️

Thank you so much for taking the time to provide your insight! One of the reasons I went with a wifi based solution was that I wanted it to be controlled over the internet by anyone. I was able to get that working, but as you can see the latency was too bad to make it practical. I love the idea of practicing some autonomous functions with it! Next robot I build I think I'm going to give up on Internet control and try to control it using a game controller or building my own custom robot controller 🫡🤣

Ayyy! thanks so much 💯💯

I've never heard of Marker Pi, I'm going to google it 🙃

Yeah i struggled with that part too with the pi and Arduino. I found out that I was scanning for the wrong serial address and that's what was preventing communication 🤣

Ayyy! Thanks!! 🫡🫡

Yes yes and yes! 😄😄

Thanks so much!!

So a wifi router works just fine without Internet. It's just acting as an access point between devices.

That's my favorite one!! 🤣🤣

Yes of course! 😄

I also love robots 🫡

Thanks!!

Humm would it be used to transport people or just small items? 🤣

Hey so I made them custom using AI! I used suno.ai

@LukasDeem  Thanks. Amazing technology. Amazing time we live in

Well I had read on the internet that if you are using a PID algorithm with the encoders that it's best to offload all those calculations onto the arduino. The second reason I did this is that I purely wanted to learn about how to get a pi and arduino to communicate!

Hey man thanks! I was inspired by @prestongoes his videos are super creative and he writes his own music.

What a fantastic production!   Your presentation was professional level...  The project was interesting... You had to 'learn as you went', and we learnt too... The pace was perfect...  There was an element of suspense...  We shared in your elation with the successes, and the pain of the failures...  AND... The custom music soundtrack was out of this world! Congratulations, and thank you so much... Liked and Subscribed - looking forward to more of the same.

Use a pcb

Crushing it dude! Keep it up!  I loved the custom songs XD

Very cool, your wife seemed very excited for the progress too! Subscribed! 👍

Yes, I liked it a lot, very good job. This would be very enjoyable doing it as a team and with a trillion in funding

Quality content, man. Keep them coming

This SCREAMS for a GSM module!

Can you like teach the code part for each video project you do !  Im like very fascinated about such Innovative projects where you face challenges and learn out of it !  As my exams are about to be over soon i will try all these not same but at a smaller level to make start my project designing ❤❤❤

Nice job, thinking it might become a project with my grand kids!

❤

You would likely have better results with a 2S lipo battery. I know the motors say 6 V but they would be fine with the 7-8.4 V of a 2S lipo, especially if you limit the PWM duty cycle. That way you could get rid of the large buck converter.  You can also get smaller motor drivers and since your motors are quite small and have gearboxes you shouldn’t need much current anyway.  Edit: piling the electronics in, even just for testing is how you end up with a short.  Also you shouldn’t need the router, the pi should be able to create its own wifi network that you can connect the laptop too.  Overall it is a good project.

I like that the shell is 3d printed but cant you use some sort of kit that makes the insides all pre assembled to make this evennmore easier and modular?

Wish this was a whole series

great job!!!! Bravo!!!

How about adding onboard ultrasonic sensors for emergency break so it's not hit the wall?

man the project was cool enough to make me watch the video, but please, 1 dont  speak on video, just hire someone to present or do a voice over, you are EXTREMELY annoying to watch, your "wife" is better, since she s natural, but your mormon like editing, the cringe (sorry I don t know any word more powerfull than cringe) songs (WTF did you started making music 5 minutes ago ?), the whole thing was a very painful experience. I just came for the code, since everything else was done by someone else, but you didnt how nor talked about any, and judging by the result, I m sure it was bad ...

coolest project with a raspberry pi that i ever seen

YouTube has revealed to me that everyone has a lot more money and time than I do.

Can you do harmonica drive 3d motor with project. I try to learn how to get L298 (red circuit board) to run with a NEMA 7 ... I am clueless because I wanted to do with 6 motors running. I have sub following by the way.

About the chosen hardware: Why didn't you use a standard arduino uno with the standard arduino motor modules (4 DC motors and a few servos per modules, and they are stackable, so two should be enough) And about the voltage: Why didn't you just max out the pwm signal as an alternative to use this big step down converter? (For example: you have 6V DC motors, but a 12 V DC power source: you can directly use the 12 V, if you limit the pwm to 50%. (or 24 V with 25% max pwm).The higher voltage doesn't harm and if the total energy is the same they don't burn/overheat. As long the difference don't get to crazy (like 3V to 48V) this should work very well.)

Wow! As an aspiring YouTube creator this is the best comment I could receive. I really appreciate your kind words. I'm doing this projects while working full time and going to grad school. Sometimes it's hard to find the motivation, so comments like these can really give me a boost! Thank you!

I would love to do that I just haven't learned PCB design yet! It's on my to do list 🤣

Ayyy! Thanks man! 😁

Thanks so much!! 😸

Haha I know right!? 🚀

Thanks so much! I'm trying my best out here ☺️☺️

Or 5G!

I was thinking 5G, but now I gotta google what a GSM module is 🙃

To be honest man the way I make the code work is I find a similar projects and copy what they have and then I use chat GPT to tweak. Or I start with some basic code that I write and then I use chat GPT to enhance the features. Have you tried using AI to help you with coding? I don't have a coding background so this has been the best way I've been able to get through these projects 🤣

@LukasDeem  nice then 😂 I will do the same after getting some initial knowledge of coding. Still I don't think chat GPT can entirely code it without any initial code fed into it .

@KuldeepB.  I think you would be surprised 🙃

@LukasDeem  let's see 🙈

That would be fun! I don't know how old they are, but I would put this under the "advanced" category. Maybe 16 years of age and up?

@LukasDeem  Well, the oldest is twelve but GrandPa will provide and support ;-)

Thank you!

Totally agree and this was quite the learning experience for me including these comments 😁. So the whole reason that I did the router in the first place was because I wanted to give control to people over the internet. I was actually able to get that working but the latency was pretty bad so I didn't include it in the video 😅

@LukasDeem  people controlling it over the internet is definitely interesting, I have seen it done once before on reddit where someone had built some robots and a website for them for people to take turns controlling them but i don't think it was that great either.  In regards to latency the latency over just a local network isn't great either. Maybe the pi isn't powerful enough to handle the video streaming although it probably should be. Was it a pi zero or pi zero 2? Did you compress the video? Either that or lowering the resolution could help. Maybe doing it as a website is just adding too much overhead, I wonder if creating a non website GUI that runs on the laptop and just streaming the video to it instead could help.  It is quite a steep learning curve to get into robotics and there isn't a definitive right way to do things either. For a first robotics project this was definitely a good and well made project. I'm very interested to see what you make next.

@conorstewart2214  awesome advice! Yeah I played around with the camera stream quality and it certainly helped. I used just a basic pi zero 😅😅

So I think for the electronics the best thing would be solid PCB but I haven't learned how to do that. Wild Willy included a design file called a Gerber file for a PCB but I don't even know how to use that yet 🤣🤣

Hey! Do you mean you want more detail on this specific build? Or just more videos similar to this one? 😸

Specific build like code

@phaniraja9104  thanks for the reply. When I make these videos I struggle to decide how detailed to get. I've even considered having a short video and then the long in depth videos. 😃

Ayyy thank you so much! ☺️

Haha yes that would be an excellent addition 😁😁

Hey thanks!! It was my first time using one 🙃

I only recently got to a point in life where I could fund my projects. As for time, I work full time and I'm a grad student. So I have to work on these projects on nights and weekends. I'm not going to lie it's tough. I think what keeps me going is a genuine curiosity. I love learning new things! 😸

Plenty of time here. Just no money. 😂

So at some point I may work on motors like that to go into a clone of the Boston Dynamics robot Spot 😅. Thanks for the sub!!

Honest truth is because I'm a beginner and I didn't know any of these things 🙃. This is exactly why I post this stuff on YouTube so that I can get comments like yours to help me learn, so thank you!😁

It would have been great if you had made a separate video detailing the electronic and power sub-assemblies. Are you connecting the battery to a terminal block to feed power to all the different components? Radio communication would be more efficient than wireless—a future upgrade--?? Nice work!

which printer did you use for the project?

Great job on the robot ! - The video is also very professional looking and informative. Would you like to see the robot that I built ?  Check out ʇǝu˙ʇoqoɹǝɥʇǝoz .  My URL is upside down.

this was honestly amazing to watch! it felt like it was just 5 minutes long... i know i will be binge watching your channel tonight!

Great editing

Awesome project, looking to forward to more of your projects!

Great Project! Looked like a ton of fun to build. The music was amazing. I thought it was sung by a human and just some audio editing, but then I wondered if it was ai generated and the comments confirmed that it was. It is very convincing and I loved it. :D

5* use of suno

@LukasDeem I know it takes a lot of dedication to finish a project like this, so as the creator of the original design, I'm really happy someone takes on the challenge. In the end that's why I shared the design.

Scrap the massive 6V buck converter and power the motor driver directly from a 2S lipo or li-ion battery. You will only need a small 6V (maybe 3A) buck converter for the servo motors.

i built a webinterface controlled pizero robot with camera as well, using python and an explorer hat. mine is much more limited with just 2 motors for motion and 1 for rotaion of the body part. you've done a great job,especially the camera. mine only handles a few frames/sec.

honestly, this a very easy project and you can use a esp32 cam module and a multiple servo driver module which will let you use a web server and more servo motors with very small and compact electronics as well. You just made everything complicated. I can make this in 2 days.

Hey! Instead of suing buck converter to drop down the voltage to 6v, you could lover max duty cycle of the pwm signals coming to h-bridge to 50%.. this would essentially result in the same voltage drop :)  you could also drop the arduino entirely and use something like adafruit 16 channel PWM/Servo controller that also connects with i2c, but it's far easier to manage (as it's doesn't need separate arduino code). these both improvements would get you much much space to work with under the hood :)   Besides that! cool one!!

The music though!!! Bro this project was A LOT work and you even did your own music. My head is off to you, sir.!! keep up the hard work can’t wait to see what comes next!

The music was great! Almost stole the show from the rover lol. What was the AI tool that you used for the?

Awesome! Great work, but why Arduino?

Not sure what you've set the voltage in the step down converter to, but keep in mind, that with the bipolar transistors on the L298Ns H-Bridges you get a voltage drop of about 1.4V, so you might get a little more power out of your motors by increasing the voltage of the stepdown converter to 7.4V, in order to give the motors 6V, if you've not already done that. You could also check the voltage drop by measuring the voltage on one of the Outputs of your Motordrivers on fullspeed

nice work 👍

Incorporate a Starlink antenna an send it of to Ukraine.

Nice build!  Good job pushing your own personal boundaries.  What’s next?

Well the reason I used Wi-Fi is because I originally wanted to set this up so that somebody could control it remotely over the internet. I actually did get that working but because of the latency I had I decided not to use it in the video. As for the power supply I soldered everything to a small prototyping board to distribute the power to all the motors. Probably not the best way to do it but it worked 🤷‍♂️

Bambu labs x1 carbon 👍

Ayyy! That's the best compliment ever! Let me know what you like most so I can keep making good stuff 😂.

Thanks! I put many hours into the edit 🤣

Hey thanks! I'm still brainstorming on my next video idea. Any suggestions are welcome 🙃

@LukasDeem a drone like nasa’s drone

Haha thanks so much! I had too much fun with it 🤣

Ayyy! I had way too much fun with it. There are many songs that didn't make it into the final edit 😂

Hey! I'm honored that you saw my video. Thanks so much for sharing your design!

The point when everything thing looks right and nothing works right is the most frustrating 💔

Hi, I've been following videos on DIY Rover and I made a car myself. wildwillyrobots' car is very good and its design is beautiful. I noticed that a long time ago. But I think it has a defect, the axle of the wheel passes through the rocker arm and is connected with the steering gear fixed in the rocker arm, which makes me doubt its strength, after all, this is 3D printed, I want this car to have a certain strength, I wonder if you have any ideas on this aspect during the development process?

@evesgf  I think you are referring to the part at 4-25 in the assembly video https://youtu.be/bXdt8hng2WM?t=265 It has a screw all the way to give it strength. The nut for the gear screw is below the head of the long screw (video 4-09), to avoid the top breaking of the part.

@wildwillyrobots  I have carefully reviewed the video and downloaded the STL file for assembly observation, and I think there are still some strength problems, but this is what I think, so I decided to make a part for testing. Anyway, thank you very much for your reply

I had a feeling that buck converter was way too big 😂

It's all about learning and having fun! That's awesome! I think mine came out pretty well I just wish I knew how to design a PCB so I could have a custom board instead of all those parts inside 😅

@LukasDeem  kicad can be used. I designed a pcb for a shift register ic so I could read multiple switches using a minimum of io ports on the pi, but a breadboard (prototyping board) is handy for checking that the design works before comitting to pcb.

Hey thanks for the comment. I build these projects so that I can learn since I'm new to this. I totally agree that I could have made this way more compact and one of the reasons I posted the video so that I could read the comments and learn.

Hey! I need to look more into this idea of lowering the duty cycle. I actually have extra pwm servo boards lying around, I didn't even think of that. I think I wanted to use the Arduino to off board some of the logic required to run the motors.

You are too kind! I seriously appreciate the support, this is my highest effort video yet 🤣

Hey thanks!! I used suno.ai

I just wanted to see if I was able to get a raspberry pi and an Arduino to communicate. What would you suggest?

@LukasDeem  raspberry pi 4..5 with motor shield and UV4L for webrtc video streaming

@LukasDeem  or you can try Milk-V Duo, it has ARM Cortex chip and Risc-V processor on the same board. So you can run even Linux and your Arduino code at the same time separately.

Hey so yeah and some of my first outdoor test I saw that it was going super slow and I knew that I needed to up the voltage. I ended up bumping it up to 7.1v thanks for the tip on how to measure the output voltage I think I need to go back and do that and see what I'm actually getting at the output of the motor drivers.

@LukasDeem  if you have the option to measure the motors voltage with an osziloscope you can even measure it at any pwm setting, as you can read the voltage during the on time.depending on the load you can actually go a bit higher than the rated voltage as well, but therefore you should measure the current through the motors under load to have a reference. You dont want the motor to get to hot

Thank you!!

Haha with the battery pack I put in that thing I'm pretty sure it could make it all the way there 🤣

Hey thanks! My goal is to push my electronics and coding abilities and my video production abilities every time I make a video ♥️. I have a few ideas I'm floating around One is to build a second version of my original video about the kinetic clock. Another one is to slap a rocket on a train just because I think that would be fun 🙃

You can use a 2 axis gimbal for the camera

Great Project!  A few tricks on the DC-DC converters... For the servos, look into a BEC for an RC plane. Much smaller than the the DC-DC you used. For the Brushed DC motors, the voltage isn't the problem, it's the current. If you set the max current limit to below the max the motors can take, they can "Run at any voltage" (as the H-Bridge will protect them.) Also, you can just run the bridges off full voltage, but limit the max PWM to 50%, for half voltage. (The current limit would be another level of protection.)  Last, look into Conformal Coating for all your PCB boards to make them water proof-ish. Dialetric grease in all the connectors (LOTS OF IT) is your friend.

That was pretty impressive. The video also. Very interesting and entertaining.

damn that's so cool, great job man.  you can use a PCB printing service to put your microcontroller, buck converter and PWM controllers all on the same board.  might be cool to add some hall-effect sensors to calibrate your motors, the problem with awesome projects like this is they never end, you're on to the next version once you're "done" :)

👍👍

Very nice project!

Did you use Suno for the music?

I want to do something like this, but use hoverboard wheels and  make it so I can control it from anywhere in the world...   I would need the user and robot to talk to each other with a MySQL working as a middle-man.  Do you have any code on GitHub?

Great job.

Do upu have a video or guide on how you prgrammed the pi and arduino?

If you keep doing stuff like this you'll be big very soon

Remove the filters completely, add a few IR diodes and you have night vision! Will look a bit weird in daylight but hey

Man the video quality is insane and the buildquality as well... i am impressed and then i saw only 4k subs... man i found a hidden gem here

Looks like a wheeled Half life head crab

Next thing, make it battery powered and run it via starlink in some remote forest or so, -> build yourself like a rc mars rover :D

lol my idea literally

Did you use Suno to make those songs?

Cool tip you may want to know about is Windows comes with a cool SLT util called 3D Builder which allows you to modify STL. I use it all the time. Using 3D builder you can add the camera hole and more important add needed vents.

I have been thinking about doing this for a bit using an ESP32 and LoRa so that I can remotely traverse the hundreds of square miles of desert I live right next to.

Thank you so much for sharing! my freind gave me his old Swampy Rover and i've fixed it up, but now i want to make a robot myself. You've given me hope

That would be awesome! Do they make them that small? Or should I try to build my own?

I've had someone mention BEC before, I need to do some research on it. I would love to find ways to make my next project like this somewhat waterproof! Thanks for the ideas!

you mean the Adafruit 16-Channel Servo Driver?

Hey thanks so much! That's my goal "edutainment" 🤣

Truer words have never been spoken 😂. I really want to learn PCB design but I haven't had time to dive into it yet. It's on my list 🙃

​ @LukasDeem  you can use easyeda for this...this is a very beginner friendly software and you can easily design a PCB with it.

Thanks!!

Yes I did! Have you tried it yet??

@LukasDeem  a couple months ago. Its was not bad. But I wanted something it couldn't do in version2. But it was still very impressive. I watched a video in the last couple days about its new version 3, exciting.  This was a cool build I think I could tackle it. Maybe make a mobile vacuum 🤔

@JasonCummer  haha the possibilities are endless!

Thanks!!

Hey! I posted my code on GitHub https://github.com/Lukas2233/Rover-Project

Ayyy!!! Thanks so much! I'm currently trying to figure out what project to do next. I'm open to suggestions 😂

Night vision would be super cool!! I was actually thinking about just putting really bright LEDs on it 🤠

Wow! Seriously thank you so much! I put a lot of work into these videos. I work full time and I'm a grad student. So it takes a lot for me to get these done. Comments like your help me maintain my motivation 🙂🙂🙂

Yesss! I thought the exact same thing! 🤣

Ayyy! That would be awesome! I've also considered running it on cell networks.

@LukasDeem  also i meant Solar :‘D but for cellular, it might be easier to connect the rover pi using wireguard or other VPN to connect to your homes router - Everything else should be the same

Is this your Rover design? I got it from Wild Willy Robots page.

Yes! It's so fun to play around with. The custom lyrics feature is 10/10

@LukasDeem  I made a vid about a modular 3d printed hot dog gun on another channel with it, with very specifically suggestive  lyrics, with the custom lyrics. I give it 10/10 too. I built my own version of the stairclimber robot on thingiverse and you've inspired me to give this one a try. Any good detailed info on getting the pi web server camera going?

@Pyromancers  so I published my code on GitHub. https://github.com/Lukas2233/Rover-Project

@Pyromancers  hopefully that helps. Originally I included a lot more detail in the video but I got advice from friends that it was too long and boring. The original edit was 27 minutes long 🤣🤣🤣. Anyway hit me up if you want help getting it going 👍

Ayyy! I had no idea. I've been trying to learn fusion 360 😄

@LukasDeem  yeah same here. But for fast modifications it is really cool. As well, if any errors are found in the STL files, the util will fix them. Very fun and simple modification tool that all should have. I myself use it at times to simply add custom supports.

@LukasDeem  I need to move to Fusion 360 yet can't get myself to stop using FreeCAD lol

Oh man that would be super cool! I was thinking about upgrading to 5G network at some point so I can in theory control it from anywhere with service.

Do it! Post a video about it 😀😀

@LukasDeem  not sure if You Tubewill let me do this but.,.. this is the old one after I fixed it . But yes, I will! thank you https://youtube.com/shorts/it0jKVa3QGg?si=ZkBH18MvBxmeNVQ-

@deanallenjones  you delivered!! I think it's hilarious that in my video the test was going over a block of wood and in yours it was going over a brick lol 🤣🤣

Ok, Nice work 😄 I am very delighted by the self written songs!🤩 and i am looking forward to more contend like this.

you should be able to set the pi up as a AP/WIFI router. to connect the pc to directly. cool vid!

This has to be AI generated Music with your own lyrics!

Awesome Project!!!  Can we make a Internet controlled Rover using ESp & Web server like Thingspeak ?

Can you please give us a circuit diagram or put a video of explaining the code and connection to the arduino Mega. This will help me with my project sir

Those AI songs are absolutely insane and I love it! lol keep up the good work this was the best one yet!

Great production value, love the rover work and songs!  Subbed!

This is awesome!!! Why didn't you use an esp32 though? (Instead of raspberry PI and Arduino)

I think the custom song is great. The only other person who does anything like this is RCtestflight. He has a friend who makes the songs for his channel. This video is great.

Cool project. After the first AI song, I found the use of the music gratuitous. Do you want us to hear the crummy music or your voiceover? Good job otherwise!

Lukas complains about bad wifi and latency. Nasa: Please... we had 20 minutes of communication time delay to the mars rover.

Great first iteration! Lets see some refinement. Nice over all job.

This songs are AI generated right?

Cool stuff, man. Have a sub

Really nice project! I saw you use tinkercad btw, I used to use it too for my own projects. And when I found onshape (free and cloudbased just like tinkercad) which had all the tools that I whished tinkercad had I immediatly switched, just wanted to share onshape with you. You could in just a few hours of tutorials get very good at it and design way better stuff than the rover model you used here!

Youse gonna be a youtuber fulltime if you keep this my friend.

The music was so spot on haha. Man! The effort you put in this video is incredible! Great job Lukas!

Looks nice!! I love it

This might just blow up!

Nice build! Love the AI generated music :)

Ayyy!!! Thanks I had way too much fun on those 😆

Oh man, I can't believe that didn't come up in my research! I'll have to look into that. Does that mean I could connect my phone to it in the field without brining a router 🤣🤣

@LukasDeem  yep loop up terms like WIFI AP mode and raspberry pi wifi server its a bit of work but very worth it. if you run into any problems ill be glad to help.

Yes! You are correct! I used chat GPT to help me with the lyrics a bit 😁

Haha awesome! All throughout the video I was thinking that the lyrics are WAY TOO MUCH right for the video lol Great attention to details!

Yes! I totally did some research on using the ESP32 with an ESP32 cam and it's feasible I just decided to go with the raspberry Pi for fun 😄😄

@LukasDeem  Thanks ! I will definitely try it with a portable router to connect it with internet as well as to control remotely

Hey so the connection between the mega and the raspberry Pi is just using the SDA and SCL pins on each device. I put the code on my GitHub so perhaps this will help https://github.com/Lukas2233/Rover-Project

@LukasDeem So the thing is i am working on the same rover using a Bluetooth module but I don't know how to connect all the motors and servo to a single Ardiuno Mega so can you please help me with it??

@akeditz8945  sure so the servos I connected to the digital pins. For the ground and power I soldered those wires to a common power rail on a prototyping board. For the DC motors I used h bridge motor driver boards. Those used a ton of the pwm and digital pins, but the Arduino can handle it. The only problem is if you want to use interrupts on the encoders. Since I used the SDA and SCL pins for serial communication I was one interrupt pin short. It's okay since you can use PID algorithms without interrupts.

@akeditz8945  if it would help we could hop on a video call and see if I can help.

@LukasDeem that would be wonderful sir please let me know when we can speak

Hi sir, as rover we just need the 6 motors to run not the servo can you please help and tell me how u connected all the motors together or if u give me a circuit diagram It will help me more please sir

Ayyy!! Thanks man! Who knows what's next 😆😆

Hey thanks so much!! I really appreciate the support. I put a lot of work into these videos, kind words like these make it worth it! 💯

I just really wanted to use a raspberry pi 😄. I'm also a fan of ESP32 and used it on a previous project. I did a little research into the esp32 camera but ultimately decided to do the Pi so I could learn more about it 😁

@LukasDeem I can't blame you, I haven't started using a camera on esp32

I dig his channel 💯💯. So I just an AI tool, all I had to do was come up with lyrics 😌

@LukasDeem  And you did a great job on the first song, very appropriate.  The later songs were awesome too!

The RCtestflight ones are very tongue in cheek, all of these are super on the nose. I like them! Some unsolicited constructive criticism though, maybe not make nearly every (outside of narration) song  one of the custom ones, just have some that are wordless beats.

Also, maybe in the future pick one or two genres of music to stick to that fits with the theme of the video, hopping around different kinds of music is... I dunno weird, not really bad, but it does not have as much flow between cuts when it switches up temp etc.

Haha so I found the AI music tool and got WAY too excited. Completely agree that I need to tone it down a bit, I was just having so much fun with it 😂😂😂

Quick Tip: Never listen to user comments that have a fictitious username on yt ❤️

@dinoscheidt  haha I take all comments with a grain of salt. 🧂🧂

@LukasDeem  I enjoyed the video. The constant AI narration via song was a bit overwhelming to me. This is the first video from your channel that the ALGORITHM sent me. I’m just sharing my opinion so you get feedback that isn’t praising the overuse of derivative AI generated music. Keep on making!

@grimpicklex  you're totally good and I 100% agree. I went a little too hard on the AI songs. 🤣🤣🤣. Your not the only one who has told me that, I just did it anyway 🙃

Hahaha! So true 😅😅😅. Seriously though I was able to drop the quality of the stream and it improved a lot 🫡

Thanks so much! The main thing I want to change is I want to learn how to use a PCB instead of a bunch of components 😂

Yep! I created custom lyrics then ran them through suno.ai it's super fun 10/10 recommend 🫡

@LukasDeem  I really liked "heading to the park", will there be an offical release? :P

@Atom224  haha I'm planning an album now 🙂

Ayyyy! Thanks so much. 🙇‍♂️

Ayyyy! Thanks man! That's the dream to be a full time creative and YouTuber 🤣🤣

Ayyy!!! Thanks so much :-D Your support means a lot! :) :)

Did you use Suno AI for the music?

@notbenparisi  yep!!

the music was so funny XD

@ianchan2624  thanks! I'm planning to post a video later today about how I made these custom songs 🤣

@LukasDeem  lol, ya i heard the song and instantly knew it was sumo. I have it open in another tab making music for my kids. It's so fun to dial in specific lyrics.

@LukasDeem  Please do it Man

@astrobot_me  I posted it a few days ago. Check it out!! https://youtube.com/shorts/SlZ-S1zoKvc?si=V1-dLnNpNiIFbqAT

@LukasDeem  could you please put those songs used in video online .. specifically?

@LukasDeem  any leads on bands that sound similar to the wired & tired song? a robotics themed fem voiced band would be great

@jacobanderson5514  haha no, but I 100% agree! 🤣

Can you please send thebsomg

Hey thanks so much!! The look of it is my favorite part 🤣🤣

Haha that's the dream! I put a lot of work into this vid 😅😅

Thanks so much! Yeah I had way too much fun making those songs 😂😂

I like the mushroom pillow on the couch

The music choices clutch and outro was awesome. Another killer video bro!

How are you so underground??? This is awesome, and I'm subscribing

This is great man!   I can totally relate to your excitement when it was finally driving around! Super cool!  Looking forward to seeing more. Keep up the great work!   I agree with others, the music is friggin fantastic.

The music had me rolling 😂hahaha! What an awesome project!!

Why does this not have more views

Ayyy this video is dope, love the song about falling in love with your project 😂😂

This music is hilarious, nice work!

It's one of many mushroom decorations in the living room 🤣

Thanks man!! I used AI to create custom songs 😆

@LukasDeem  Suno?

@kindaovermyhead  that's right!

Ayyy! That's the best compliment thanks so much! I just got started this year so I'm hoping it will grow as I post more 💯💯

Hey thanks so much! What this video didn't capture is the two months of struggles that I went through to get that thing working lol. I'm sure you can sympathize 😂😂. Thanks for the thoughtful comment ♥️

​ @LukasDeem dude. The victory wouldnt be as sweet without it!  Right?! Haha the Portal vibes with the tunes are inescapable. 😂. I wish I still had my podcast as I'd totally want to get you on there and talk shop! 😂

@Geeksmithing that's a huge compliment! I'm a total newbie but I really enjoy this stuff and haven't having a blast learning!

Ayyy! Had a ton of fun making those songs 😆😆😆

I’m half way through a just realized the songs are custom. 😮😂

I believe they were all generated by Suno AI. Pretty cool tech!

@notbenparisi  every song with lyrics was AI. The background music in some places came from epidemic sound

Hey thanks! I hope people like it 🙀

Thanks so much! My personal favorite is the song about driving it over the planks of wood 😂😂

Haha thanks so much! I used suno.ai I put in custom lyrics 😆😆

I agree, that cracked me up!
