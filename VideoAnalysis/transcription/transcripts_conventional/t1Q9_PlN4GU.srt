1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Now that we have looked at positions and velocities,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
it's time to study the dynamics of a quadrotor.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Once again, let's remind ourselves that we have two coordinate systems,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
one attached to the moving robot,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
and the other, the inertial coordinate system.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
B1, B2, B3 constitute the set of unit vectors

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
that describe the body fixed coordinate system,

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and likewise A1, A2, A3 describe the coordinate system that's fixed to the inertial frame.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Recall that you have four rotors, each of which is independently actuated.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
R is the position vector of the center of mass,

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
and we know expressions for the thrusts that the motors produce on the airframe.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We also know the expressions for the reaction moments,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and both of these are proportional to the square of the angular speeds of the rotors.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We've seen how Euler angles are used to represent rotations.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We will use the ZXY convention, the first rotation being about the Z-axis through Psi,

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
the second one about the X-axis, and the third one about the Y-axis.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So the first axis is yaw, the second one is roll, the third one is pitch.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Again, just to remind ourselves, this is the ZXY convention.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The first rotation is the ZXY convention.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The second rotation is about the X-axis through Psi, this is the roll angle.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And finally, the pitch about the Y-axis through Psi.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of course, there are singularities.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Singularities occur when the roll angle is equal to zero, which is Psi equal to zero.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And even when the angle phi is not equal to zero, you can have two sets of Euler angles for every rotation.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's look at the external forces and moments that act on the airframe.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We have four thrusts, F1, F2, and F3, and F4, and then four moments, M1, M2, and M3, and M4.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The sum of the forces is obtained by adding up the thrust vectors and the gravity vector.

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The sum of the moments is obtained by adding up the reaction moments, as well as the moments of the thrust forces.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Again, these are vector computations.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You have to add 3 by 1 vectors in each of these equations.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,000
To predict the net acceleration, we have to write down the equations of motion.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
These come from Newton and Euler, and they're called the Newton-Euler equations.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Down is another direction of your nest.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You set up theength vector transport Gestanca стен.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
By holding 2 points that each of which is used in passive существ,

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
against Lot alta Ettrace, Hence, this is Psi equal to 0,8-17-18-18-50,

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is a Psi someone at 616-Euler equation.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
From Python and for AirPods two, please look at how mouse some places are rolling.

39
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Its number of the non-looking names and these ones are rolling.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This means introduction alone.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It is a Psi late.

42
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It is the pin.
