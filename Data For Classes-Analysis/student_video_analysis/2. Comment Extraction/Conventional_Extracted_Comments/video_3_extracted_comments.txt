Takeaways:  00:00 🤖 Designing robotic grippers for interaction with real-world environments. 1.1 Start with observation of the environment to deploy the robot. 1.2 Maturing technology allows for robots to move and manipulate objects. 1.3 Manipulation refers to the capability of the robot to interact with its environment. 1.4 Focus on two projects: a drone and a planetary exploration robot. 1.5 Aerial grasping is a challenge for drones because of disturbances during mid-air interaction. 1.6 Control strategies must be developed to compensate for disturbances and ensure the drone captures the target. 06:03 💡 Designing a gripper for the drone. 2.1 Consider the type of interaction the drone will have with the environment. 2.2 Design the gripper to be light, strong, and efficient. 2.3 Make sure the gripper is capable of holding the target securely. 2.4 Choose materials that are suitable for the environment and task. 2.5 Integrate the gripper into the control system to ensure smooth operation. 08:19 🚀 Designing a gripper for the planetary exploration robot. 3.1 Consider the conditions on the planet, such as terrain and atmosphere. 3.2 Design the gripper to be compact, strong, and durable. 3.3 Make sure the gripper can handle objects of different sizes and shapes. 3.4 Choose materials that are suitable for the harsh environment of the planet. 3.5 Integrate the gripper into the robot's mobility and control systems.

when you let it go to crawl to the next rock is it safe to leave 2 anchors not let all 3 go  as one pulls the other extends?
