00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey, what's happening guys? Yesterday we talked about this class AB amplifier with the TDA2030.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:13,300
And today, as promised, we're going to build that circuit.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,960
So, I've had this kit on my wish list for a while.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:30,140
It's from ICStation.com and it's the TDA2030 amplifier kit.

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,200
And I would like to thank Dave for sending it out to us.

6
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,660
So, we're going to build it and have ourselves a nice TDA2030.

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:57,780
If we take a look here at the circuit board, you can see there are a few changes from the circuit that I drew yesterday.

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:05,000
They're using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 capacitors.

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,180
And my circuit had what?

10
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,080
8.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,960
Then there are also 4 ceramic capacitors.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,860
So, that's like 13 total capacitors here.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Yeah.

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,960
So, that's a little different.

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,160
Also, only one diode.

16
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,480
Which is a little strange.

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,400
But, I think we'll make it work.

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:37,300
Alright.

19
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,900
Buckle up.

20
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,380
We're going to do this fast mode.

21
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:42,400
We're going to do this fast mode.

22
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,460
Now, come on.

23
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,380
Another time.

24
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,380
But, let's check on.

25
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,380
I don't care about Eolt.

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:18,660
Okay.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,740
So, we want to do this fast mode.

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,600
And we're going to do it fast pharmacist.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,260
Doing it fast.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,920
And we're going to use the cam.

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,340
Today we're going to do it fast debate.

32
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:24,660
And what's it mean?

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,060
We're going to do this fast mode.

34
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,760
I do not want a seat.

35
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,520
Now, we know the about theünk Ho.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,780
When I look imbalpsy for some any piece,

37
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,180
I want to aim for time at the gym.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,440
So, we will carry you over the profession.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,680
We're going to do this fast decibels.

40
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,800
That's super lumico.

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,180
We'll do it fast and see you guys.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,480
And, and download the Cristo from all across,

43
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,920
and is the Fi.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:03:07,900
Thank you.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:37,900
Thank you.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:04:07,900
Thank you.

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Thank you.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,920
Thank you.

49
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
Thank you.

50
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,920
Thank you.

51
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Thank you.

52
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,920
Thank you.

53
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,920
Well, we're just about done.

54
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,100
The only thing left is this little power jack.

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,000
And, no.

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't want to use it.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't like those jacks.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't have anything to use it with.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So, for our purposes today, I'm just going to cut some wire.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And, strip it.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And, we'll just hook it up with alligator clips.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Now, one thing.

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I just realized.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
These speaker terminals here for bare wire.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, that's kind of ugly.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, that needs fixed.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, that needs fixed.

68
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yeah.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't have any speakers that hook up like that.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So, before we can really test this out.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I need to get a hold of a couple of speakers of that ilk.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I will grab some tomorrow.

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I think if I go up to my mom's house, there might be some old stereo speakers from when

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I was a boy.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
So, we can go check that out.

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Okay.

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Last soldering for this guy.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It took me about an hour to put this together.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Aren't you glad I condensed it?

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Alright.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So, the piece de resistance.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There we go.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nice.

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
So, let's smoke test it.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We'll hook it up to 12 volts.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And hopefully, the only thing that lights up is the LED.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I got that set for 6 volts.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let me get in here and change it.

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Voltage.

91
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Boom, boom.

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Zip.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Boom, boom.

94
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Zip.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Boom, boom.

96
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And I got that set for 6 volts.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:11,560
lights up is the LED. I got that set for 6 volts let me get in here and change it.

98
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Voltage boom boom zip and power. Okay so our LED is lit sniff testing

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:42,300
nothing seems unreasonably hot

100
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:57,540
yeah I guess I soldered everything in the right direction then power that down

101
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:04,440
now I don't know if you could see it in the video because it went so fast but I

102
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:12,180
put thermal grease in between those TDA 2030s and the heat sinks get these on

103
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:20,280
eBay just put in thermal paste you get like 10 syringes for two dollars or

104
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:29,280
something ridiculous like that. Alright so anyway there's our amplifier that's all

105
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,860
we can do for tonight we will do the rest when I pick up a pair of speakers to test

106
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:49,860
it with and instead of just shoving some audio through it I think what we might do

107
00:08:49,860 --> 00:09:10,200
is hook up this AD9833 digital synthesis chip and put some different frequencies through it

108
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,820
you know we hook that up to the Arduino and we can sweep it through some different frequencies

109
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,980
and we'll put it on a scope and look at the output. So if you guys want to see that

110
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,380
give me the old thumbs up feel free to comment share and don't forget to subscribe.

111
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:30,880
That's it I'm out peace except the Ravens

112
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,880
you

113
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,880
you
