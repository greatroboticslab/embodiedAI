How to write arduino code for drone?

sen drone yapmamıssın ki kasa toplamıssın

It is normal for motors to warm up. There is no problem as long as it does not exceed 60-70 °C. If you use a propeller larger or smaller than the propeller dimensions specified in the engine's technical specifications, the engine will heat up much more than normal. Technical limits must be observed.

thank you so much you helped me a lot @Kendin-Yap

Yes you can

Thanks.. All names and links are below the video. Click "more" or "show more"

The link are below the video. Click "more" or "show more"

Motor size is important. KV value is a different matter. The ones I use are 1806. If you are talking about 2212 motors, the propeller has to be much longer. Therefore, you need to enlarge the body as well. It is necessary to enlarge the body according to the propeller dimensions suitable for your motor.

@Kendin-Yap  thanks man 👍

Bir adı yok. El yapımı çünkü. yapım videosunu kanalımda bulabilirsiniz.

Hi, Nothing but the processes shown in the video. Don't waste time with code if you can't run it. The code is fine. Focus on the hardware. You must have made the circuit perfect. And you should know that NRF modules are somewhat problematic modules. They are affected by electrical noise and cause connection problems. NRF module cables should be as short as possible. It may also be helpful to wrap the GND cable around the CE and CSN cables to block out noise.

And what did you do when you was doing something on display I don’t know what you did in configuration on display controller board. Can you please tell me what it was please How did you connect receiver I don’t see back side. I don’t know how to connect the receiver  I have to program receiver ???

Why do all these make it yourself videos, have to show every screw being installed?we don’t need every darn detail! The redundancy turns me off. I think I can figure that stuff out! Just get to the point!

If you have some video editing ambitions then I may have an idea for something you could try.  At 0:50 you have the measurements for the board, but you rotate the board while the measurements stay in place. It would be cool if the measurements would follow the board and rotate along with it. This could be done tediously by keyframing every frame individually, but some video editing programs also have tracking features which allow you to make it follow the pcb's position and rotation automagically.  I think it would look cool if it were like that, but it's absolutely fine the way it is. So if you don't feel like doing something like that then that's totally fine :D

really loved it and learnt a lot. One doubt though, whether the transmitter and receiver is the same one that you made earlier in different video(the 6 channel transmitter)? And another question, will you make a arduino based flight controller for the same? thank you for the videos and love from India.

sir, when will you upload ideas about remote control with arduino again?

Nice

♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️

loved your video.  do you have anything on how you build the hand controller.

How much money you spend

Bağımsız olarak takılabilir. Kontrol kartının kamera bağlantısı yoktur.

@Kendin-Yap  peki kullandığın kontrol kartından başka kamera bağlantılı kart önerirmisin

@gorkemozturk9128  Bu sadece PWM kanallara sahip. S-Bus desteği yok. PWM kanallar ile çalışabilen kontrolcüleri kullanabilirsin. Biraz araştırman gerek. Çünkü genellikle S-Bus ile çalışırlar.

Hi man, I have a question.. is it possible that if I use cheap drone motor and has low RPM my drone won't fly? How to choose correct drone motor? I'm a beginner...

فاک یو بچ

Hocam merhabalar.Kanaldaki motor sürücüyü yaptım (8520 motorlarla daha hafif bir drone yapmayı düşünüyorum)fakat burada esc kullanılmış.Ben mosfetin gate bacağını kk2 ye versem(esc nin sinyal bacağının bağlandığı yere) olur mu?Her bir motor için bir adet yaptım.Kontrolcüyü yakmaktan korkuyorum hocam çok pahalı bir alet...Verimsiz olacağını biliyorum  fakat maddiyat şuanlık bu kadarına yetiyor,birazcık havalansa yeter daha sonrasında daha büyüğünü yapacağım inşallah.

A high speed motor is required for the drone. And it should have enough strength.

@Kendin-Yap  what is minimum RPM required?

KK2 pwm sinyali veriyor. Direk Mosfetle olmaz. Ama fırçalı motor kullanacaksanız arduino ile ESC yapabilirsiniz.

@Kendin-Yap  hocam zaten drone ağırdı birde arduino eklersem ağırlaşacak.Vede kontrolcünün ucuna nasıl eklenir o da meçhul..Desenize mecbur esc ile fırçasız motor almak zorunda kaldım :( sağolun yanıtınız için....

Hocam nasıl ucuza kapatabilirim piyasada bir sürü esc var bir videoda her esc her kontrolcüyle çalışmaz deniyordu.Bu videodaki esc çok pahalı.Var mı başka alternatif escler şunu alabilirsin dediğiniz? 20A lik 50 tl lik ucuz esclerden kullansam olur mu hocam?

Ye you can

Can you share me connection of receiver 4 chanel and kk2 Please

:y:

Merhabalar öncelikle emeğiniz için çok teşekkürler gerçekten çok güzel işler çıkarıyorsunuz. Sizden ufak bir ricam olacaktı. Oynatma listesi olarak yapımı ucuz, orta düzey ve yüksek maliyet olan videolarınızı listeleyebilir misiniz?

Brother your are very amazing engineer, so plzz you make Fly spy drone with hd camera

Hocam merhaba.Bu dronu 8520 fırçalı motorla yapmaya kalksam sorun olur mu?Çünkü kk2 yi aldım ve motorlar ve escler pahalı olduğu için fırçalı motor aldım,buna uygun motor sürücü alırsam uygun ortamı sağlamış olur muyum? Kumandayı da kanaldaki kumanda videosundan esinlenerek yaptım.

i thought you are a highly intelligent man

bu drone a radio master tx16s ayarlanabilir mi?

Great work! What is the Maximum flying range of this drone?

apna no do plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

Macam mana nak  order 1 set barang semua..  Supaya tidak timbul masalah tidak ikut spesifikasi.. saya meme berminat diy helicopter cuma tiada basic ..

There is a link at the end of the video and below.

Pratik olarak mümkün değil. İnsan refleksi yeterli olmayacaktır. Drone lar sabit kanatlı uçaklar gibi değildir. Ancak bir gyro sistemi ile kontrol edilebiliyorlar.

@Kendin-Yap  eywallah hocam teşekkür ederim bide bende kk2.1 kontrol kati ile bir drone yaptim ama bu kontrol kartı ile ben akro modda kullanmadım normal drone gibi kullana biliyorum takla vs attiramiyorum bunla ilgili bir bilgin varmı . Hocam bide ben tricopter ve bicopter yapmayi planlıyorum denemek amacli ama YouTube Türkçe bir video bulamadım eger sen yapa bilirsen onunda videosunu cekermisin

8520 çok minik bir motor. Bunun için gücü kesinlikle yeterli olmaz. Bulabilirsen 39000 rpm DC180 fırçalı motorlar ile yapabilirsin. Ama Fırçasız motor gibi verimli olmayacaktır.

KK2 kartı tüm kumanda tipleri ile çalışır.

Pourrais tu faire pour la télécommande stp merci

Hocam merhaba bende drone yapıyorum.Kanaldaki 6 kanallı kumanda ile herhangi bir kontrol kartıyla bağlantıya geçebilir miyim? Yani alıcı olan NRF modülü herhangi bir kontrol kartına uyumlu mudur? Yoksa illa ki bu kontrol kartını mı almalıyız? Uyumlu olsa bile bağlantıları neye göre olur hocam ?

I want this

It has the link below the video and in the last scene.

Evet. FPV kameralar bağımsız olarak kendi vericisi ile çalışır. Sorun olmaz.

He is Turkish. If that guy had done the voice-over in the video, it would have been in Turkish.  Maybe that's why you don't understand conversations.

@oylesinebirhesap211  why the rude response?

Sadece KK2 gibi PWM bağlantı (Klasik bağlantı) için uygun. S-Bus bağlantlılı kontrolcüler ile bağlanamaz.

En ucuz şekilde yapılmış bir drone videosu çeker misin ve bu kumandayı kullansan

3:16 is it strong..just with glue gun, kendin?

what  the special  thing you do with drone???? It is the same parts of the drone that only you packaged !!! the best thing is to buy the drone with few dollars from your source!!!!

Bir sorum olacak aynı kumanda ve alıcı ile fırçalı motor kullanarak da olur mu bu arada güç önemsiz bana uçsun yeter çünkü bu malzemeleri alacak param yok ama srnin kumandandan yaptım bende onu kullanmak istiyorym birde bu kontrolcü ile olur mu Tiny Naze32 SPRACING F3 (lütfen cevap verir misin çünkü bende bir drone yapmak  istiyorum ve daha bu konuda çok bilgim yok yeni başladımda şimdiden teşekkürler

Bir de bu motorlar 2280KV diyor bende 980KV var olur mu onları kullansam?

980 kv olmaz. Düşük devirli olduğu için 9 veya 10 inç pervane gerekir. Pervanelerin sığması için Gövdenin büyütülmesi gerekecektir. Sarı renk ile sinyal kablosu temsil ediliyor. Bazı ESC lerde Beyaz renklidir. Sarı ile Beyaz aynıdır yani.

Kesinlikle gerekli. Dronelar model uçaklar gibi manuel uçurulamaz. Dronelar da Gyro içeren kontrolcü kartları gereklidir.

It is strong enough.

@Kendin-Yap  why not acrylic..yapp? 👌

Gerektiği kadar güce sahip fırçalı motor da olabilir. Tabi ESC lerinde fırçalı olması gerekir. Tiny NAZE32 kontrolcüyü bilmiyorum. Bağımsız PWN çıkışları varsa olur. Çoğu kontrolcü S-Bus  veya benzeri tek hatlı bağlantı ile alıcıya bağlanır. KK2 öyle değil. O yüzden onu kullandım. Bu kumanda S-Bus gibi protokoller ile çalışmaz.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we1i5VTC-9c

Teşekkürler. Bu tip küçük racer drone tarzı modellerde pilin genel yerleştirme alanı orasıdır. Ağırlık merkezinin aşağıda olmasının faydası var. Bir koruma kabı veya ayak gereksiz ağırlık olarak görülüyor. Düşme ve çapma gibi durumlarda istatistiksel olarak bakarsanız bir dronun gövde altının çarpma ihtimali diğer kısımlardan daha düşüktür. Yıllarca bunu gözlemledik. Yine bir miktar risk var tabi ama kabul edilebilir...

Everywhere I go, I see his face.

Öndekiler içe doğru. Arkadakiler dışa doğru dönmeli. Pervaneyi düz yüzeye koyduğunda pallerin yüksek kısımları dönme istikametidir. Yani hucum kenarıdır.

Sir please give your phone number

Sir please give your phone number

Dronu yapmak için 2 adet saat yönünün tersine 2 adet saat yönünde sıkılan motor mu almalıyız yoksa hepsi saat yönünde sıkılan mı olmalı

what is the range of this drone and how long the battery lasts?

It can be used with 3S 18650.. Arduino uno big and heavy for this model.

@Kendin-Yap  ill put arduino uno as remote and nano as reciever will that work?

@Kendin-Yap  is 0.2C to 5C discharge rate of 18650 enough ? Instead of 18650 30amp discharge rate batteries to the drone i mentioned above?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBnFZGfsjI&t=1s

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBnFZGfsjI

Yes it works. There is no reason it shouldn't work.

En az 5 kanal gerekli

@Kendin-Yap  üstadım ben 4 kanal yaptım ucmadi.ucmama sebebi kumandanın 4 kanal Olması olabilir mi.

@mustafasuner1  İdeal olan 6 kanaldır. Motor ları başlatmak için bir kanal ve uçuş modlarını kontrol etmek için bir kanal daha gereklidir. En azından 5 kana gereklidir.

Bu videoda gösterdiğim gibi 2 saat yönü ve 2 adet saat yönünün tersi  motor gerekli. Ama önemli olan motorlar değil. pervane yönleridir. Çünkü motorların yönünü değiştirebilirsiniz. Motorlardaki sıkma yönü pervanenin gevşemesini önlemekle ilgilidir. Ama artık bir çok motorda fiberli, kiltli somun çıkıyor. Bu somunlar yön ters olsa da gevşemiyor zaten.

Can you make video to make remote

why dint you use wood not plastic or wood huh you poor or what?????????????? >:(

Very nice drone

Bhai Mere drone flip problem h with apm 2.8. Please let me know if it is fixed it or not.

Bende kendim yapayım dedim. Ama böyle hazır modüller kullanarak değil her bir ayrıntısı ile. Küçük motor kullanayım ki esc ye gerek kalmasın dedim. Daha sonra büyük motorlu esc li yaparım. Pdb (güç dağıtım kartı) tasarımı, kumanda kartı, bys ve alıcı-verici rf tasarımı yapmam gerekiyordu. Rf alıcı-verici tasarımı nasıl yaparım diye saatler süren araştırmalarım sonucu bu işin kendi başına çok büyük bir iş olduğunu gördüm. İşin büyüklüğü ve zorluğu ile piyasadaki hazır rf modülünün parası arasında hicbir alaka yok. Anladım ki motivasyonumu kaybetmeden küçük adımlarla ilerlemeliyim, herşeyi kendim tek hamlede yaparak büyük ve tek bir adımda halledemem. Sonuçta herbir parça ayrı bir başlık altında kendi içinde dallara ayrılarak projelendirip ayrı bir uğraş haline getirdim. Motivasyonumu korumak için hazır alacağım rf modülü geçici olarak küçük çaplı farklı projelerde ve tasarlayacağım dron da kullanacağım.

No GPS? Why the setting is loaded with lots of info than huawei 😂

Efsane kanal adam gibi adam

very good...

THks for help , is it necessary to connect the AUX to Channel 5 ???  because i will make your RC Transmitter only with 4 channel . 12A ESc is it enough for 1000kv brushless motor ??

Dron'a kamera takabilir miyiz? Yakabilirsek nasıl takarız?

what is the name of the shape you have on the table that has centimeters and squares?i want to buy one and i don't know where i can find ...

👀🤯💖👍

abi nerelisin :)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBnFZGfsjI

Available on my channel. I have done... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBnFZGfsjI&t=29s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD7rQbnSbek

Aux connection is not required. 1000KV motor is not suitable. A 9 or 10 inch propeller is required for 1000KV. Too long. It cannot be used for a small drone of this type.

cutting mat

kameralı drone da yapabilir misin ? Harika olur bence

Hocam merhaba, videolarınız çok kaliteli yürekten tebrik ediyorum. Ben internette bu eski oyun kolları (joystick FT Aviator gibi) ile drone kontrolü yapmak ile ilgili araştırmalar yapıyorum ancak bulamadım. Bir örnek çalışma yaparsanız harika olurdu. Başarılar dilerim 👏👏👏

Sir,can you please tell how to make the remote controller for this Drone.

Merhabalar, Receiver'ın olduğu plaketin bağlantılarını detaylı anlatabilir misiniz?? Teşekkürer ederim, çok güzel olmuş. İyi çalışmalar

very cool Don't forget to stop by my channel, chennel creative friends friendship and trust👍🙏❤️

3D yazıcım yok nasıl yapayım diye sitem edenlere güzel örnek olmuş.

Bravo söylenecek söz bulamıyorum.kumandada kullandığınız joistick leri nereden temin edebiliriz

I'm the 6200 th like

Çok basit bir olay

Eski oyun kolları ile olur mu bilmem ama Unity oyun motoruna biraz hakimseniz, Arduino ve Unity arasında Serial Port üzerinden entegrasyon yaparak modern oyun kolları ile kontrol sağlayabilirsiniz. Ben de taze bir yazılım mühendisi olarak tamamen el yapımı bir drone yapma işine merak saldım. Yazılımını yazmayı gözüm kesiyor da işin donanım kısmı, uçuş fiziği vesaire falan hala soru işareti. İyi çalışmalar dilerim.

@mehmetbatuhanarslanturk1661  usta uçuş kontrol kartının frameworkleri filen internette var mı ? kendi kendine rota belirleyip bu rotayı gidebilecek bir drone yapmayı deniyorum da nereden başlıyim ?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBnFZGfsjI&t=3s

u can

130-150 meters

But in info of the wireless module it is given as 1100m is it possible?

Arduino alone is not enough. It can be with Arduino nano + Gyro module.

@Kendin-Yap  so one Arduino as receiver and another as flight controller with gyro may be possible right???   Waiting for your reply ♥️ Lots of love

possible, but its range will be short.

Thanks

@Kendin-Yap  how many meter it goes

Detay derken?? Dron için tüm yapım detayı var zaten videoda. Kumandadan bahsediyorsan kumandanın videosu ayrıdır. Videonun sağ üstünde link ikonu var. Ayrıca videonun sonunda da linki mevcut.  Ve Videonun altındaki detay kısmında da malzemelerin linkleri ve kumandanın yapım videosunun linki mevcut.

@Kendin-Yap  bu delikler kaç santim arayla delinecek orada bir kafam karıştı O yüzden detayları sormuştum Yine de sağ ol açıklama kısmını okudum Video için teşekkürler

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjBnFZGfsjI

yes you can

@Kendin-Yap  ok thank you

The link is below the video and it is on the final scene of the video.

Do it is called review mat it is available in Amazon,flipcart,etc,..

Malzemeleri isimleriyle aratınca bir çok satıcı çıkacaktır. İsimleri videonun altındaki açıklama bölümündedir. Bazılarını www.promodelhobby.com da bulabilirsiniz. Kumanda menzili yaklaşık 130-150 metre.

youtubede videoları vardır aslında

1200 lira civarında :(

The range of this remote is approximately 130-150 meters.

How to make remote for drone

Can you give the links

Very clever and good luck on anything you build next. The Hoppers, down under.    (Australia)

Please say flight time of this drone

Bu uçuş kontrolcü kartı olmadan da yapmak mümkün mü ? Ne de olsa sizin yaptığınız kumandadan bilgiyi gönderiyorsunuz, droneda ki nrf24 kartı o bilgiyi alıp arduino nano üzerinden o bilgiyi motorlara taşıyamaz mı ?

What is your total money to make this drone

I can use the 3d printed the body

about 6-8 minutes

Kontrolcünün asıl işi komutları aktarmak değil. Gyro desteği sağlıyor. Dronelar uçaklar gibi değildir. Gyro desteği olmadan insan refleksi ile kontrol edilemezler. Gyro otonom eksen kontrolünü sağlar. Yani istem dışı eksen yatmalarını engeller.

Cutting and drilling FR4 (pcb board) is dangrous for your health because it produces glass powder (FR4 is fiber glass). If you inhale that, your system cannot get rid of it so it accumulates (similar to asbestos) . In general cutting and drilling FR4 is a "big no no" in elecronic assembly labs(use a PCB gillotine for cutting it). When it cannot be avoided, it is recomended to be done eithe in water, or with wet boards (so that the powder doesn't fly off).

good day sir.! help please.. I'm having trouble in calibrating the esc on the kk2.. how did you do yours.?  thanks in advance..

How to cost

If I use 1000kv motor with 30A ESC, the flight controller settings will be same or not?? Please answer sir.

Bu kanalı 300 abonesi oldugu zamanlardan beri takip ediyorum bu kadar buyuyeceği kalitesinden belliydi zaten yine mukemmel bir iş çikarmişsin hocam kolay gelsin

What are the names of electronic parts used?

bro please tell how far it can go?

Is ka remote kaise banaye

Good  job

Please can you give me ur kk and motor esc please because I have no money for new

Thanks for reminding

Thanks

the pcb he is drilling in the video is paper phenolic no glass epoxy

1- Transmitter open and throttle stick at maximum 2- Press and hold the two outer buttons on KK2 at the same time. Connect the battery 3- When you hear two beeps from the motors, take the throttle to the minimum level. it is ok.  (Note: propellers should not be installed for safety.)

@Kendin-Yap  thank you for the reply sir.. I found out what was my mistake.. I made individual power switches for the RX and KK which I turn on the RX then KK, the throttle rapidly goes to its max, which it should be powered on simultaneously when calibrating the esc.. I've corrected it.. but still they dont seem to spin at the same time.. does using different esc affects calibration.? the front L/R and rear L/R esc are not the same..

Big propeller required for 1000KV motor. This is not suitable for frame size. And settings change.

@Kendin-Yap  Sir, can you please guide me about the settings? I am using F450 body and 10 inch big propeller

Nice bro.but u didn't tell that how to prepare the remote for your drone. . Plz send the video that how to prepare the remote also.

Is it possible to make the flight controller with arduino as well just like the receiver??please answer sir

Please mujhe bhi bataiye ki drone ka     Saman kahaan se milta hai aur iska kitna kharcha hota hai

Hocam instagram hesabınız varmı

Abi mükkemmel çalışmalarının devamını dilerim dolar uçmuş ben kumanda bile alamiyrum

O motorlar yerine normal kucik drone motoari olmazmi

Herseyi buldukda motoru nerden bulcaz

@kendinYap I love your videos, these are simple but very explanatory. Could you please make a drone or plane which streams live video stream to a mobile app using data cable as commercial drones do. They use the same remote control and a data cable to attach with a mobile phone to record live video. I watched an FPV video on your channel too but it was streaming the video to another receiving screen but not to the mobile app. Thank you in advance for your guidance and help.

SAMİMİ Bİ ŞEKİLDE İFADE EDİYORUM inancın varmı bilmem ama gerçekten ALLAH razı olsun

OMG

Hello super vidéo ✅

Nice drone, but I would prefer just buying a drone.

çok teşekkürler

Pi parametrelerini neye göre giriyorsun?

Abi san a daha yeni abone oldum bu yüzden kusurabakma videoların çok güzel bide rica etsem ban 6.i kumanda gönderir misin

I'm from Brazil, congratulations and thank you!

what is the maximum distance?

Maliyeti ne kadar acaba?

abi kontrol kartını da arduino kullansam sıkıntı çıkmaz değil mi

RC uçak için lipo pil bakıyorum da motorlarım fırçalı. 180 DC motorlar.  Uygun esc buldum fakat lipo pilin esc ye uyumlu olmaması durumu var mı acaba neye göre seçmeliyim? Cevap verirseniz çok sevinirim, teşekkürler.

Kodlar?

I've already done it before. I made the remote in this video myself. You can watch my other videos. https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucgjjge17yfovavwuzejf

safe range 130-150 meters

Bunlar fırçasız drone motoru ve fırçasız esc ler. Normal küçük drone motoru ile fırçalı küçük motorları söylüyorsan bu sistem için pek uygun değil.

Sağolasın.

Lol thats not the case imao.

Limit değerlerini belirlemek kolay. Hareketlerin açılarını göz kararı belirleyebilirsiniz ve sınırlayabilirsiniz. Zor olan gyro hassasiyet ayarları. Bunlar deneme yanılma ile bulduğum değerler. Genel mantık şu şekildedir. titreme ve aşırı tepki varsa düşürüyorum. Yavaş salınımlar yapıyorsa ve iyi düzeltme yapmıyorsa yükseltiyorum. Biraz deneme yanılma sonrası doğru değerlere ulaşabilirsiniz. Ama bu arada kol uzunluğu ve motor devri de bunları etkiler. Motor devri düşük ve kol boyu uzunsa daha yüksek hassasiyet değerleri gerekir.

Al bak kumanda

Arduino ile Gyro PID ayarlarını yapmak kolay değil ama mümkün.

@Kendin-Yap  çok teşekkür ederim

Bahsettiğiniz motorlar 2S (7.4V) LiPo ile kullanılabilir. ESC ninde bu voltaj ile çalışabilmesi gerekir. Teknik özelliklerinde belirtilir genellikle.

Videonun altındaki detay kısmına bakmalısın

Where in this video you have not given radio

Dang, still using a KK board....

Hocam kanalınızla bugün tanıştım. Bir mühendislik öğrencisi olarak takdir ediyorum emeklerinizi. Elinize sağlık, dilerim çok daha iyi yerlere ulaşırsınız.

Abi tam da yeni bi drone videosu olsa da izlesem diyodum aklımı okumuşsun

Hocam esc gibi bazı elemanlar çok pahalı. eski sayılmayan bir drone inceledim, kücük tek devre ile kızılötesi yardımıyla motorlara bağlanıp kumanda ile kontrol ediyordu. bunun için detaylı bir video çekebilirmisiniz? wifi modülü ile olabilir, nrf24l01 ile olabilir, sp8622 ile olabilir. saygılar

abi bu yaptığın icatlardan 1 tane fala varsa uçak vceya drondan 1 tane verebilirmisin lütfen

eline emeğine sağlık.  ortalama kaç dakika ucuyor? bilgisini verebilir misin? kendi drone'umu bu motor ve pili upgrade etmek istediğimden soruyorum.

keşke sizin elektronik bilginizin yarısı kadarı bende olsa .(

https://youtu.be/fXay0PiKPa4     abi yaptığın bu uçağın aynısını ahşaptan yaparmısın. Daha detaylı bir şekilde.     Seviliyorsun (:(:(:

İşte beklediğim içerik.Kumandanın yapıldığı videonun altına yazdığım yorumda onunla bir dron toplarsınız artık demiştim.Keyifle seyrettim. Elinize sağlık.

Hocam. Merhaba, ucuz malzemelerden bir drone için 3 eksenli bir video kameranın sabitleyici yapmanın mümkün olup olmadığını merak ediyorum?! kompakt ve hafif olabildiğince ucuz olmak, çünkü artık kolay bir zaman olmadığını biliyorsunuz. Eğer bir tane inşa edebilirsiniz sonra bu video hakkında çıkarmak görmek çok memnun olacak.

iyi olmuş ama pahalıya çıkmış.dıy ın amacı ucuz olmasıdır.

Tipine bakıp abi bu da dandik olur diyorum ama her yaptığın mı böyle güzel uçar abi ya :D yapması basit gibi görünse de baya emek ve zaman istiyor bence eline sağlık. Bu arada yapan ve uçuran aynı kişi mi

Abi mesleğin ne

Mannn that is awesome and im following your video to make my own. Ill really appreciate if you could add an oled display to the transmitter  really liked it maann

Your instagram??

Super bro..

sir please put fpv camera on it

Abi bişey sorcam  8:05 deki motor bağlantıları rastgele mi bağlanıyo

hocam çok başarılı olmuş elinize saglık. kullandığinız pist nerde bilgi alabilirmiyim  özel değilse. Birde Fsi6 kumandayı kullanmak istesek bilgi vermeniz mümķünmü? Bu kartta nasıl kullanabiliriz

You can order this  from jlcpcb .

Very well done indeed!!!

hocam  çok güzel yapıyosunuz biraz daha kolay malzemelerle yapsanız olur mu

Dronlar 3 eksen gyro + 3 eksen ivme ölçere sahip uçuş kontrolcü desteği olmadan uçamazlar. Bu drone da KK2.15 isimli olan kartın görevi budur... O düzeltmeyi bu kart desteği ve kumandadan verdiğim komut gerçekleştiriyor.

@Kendin-Yap  teşekkür ederim hocam.

Videonuz tamamen kendi çekiminiz olacaksa (Yani mevcut videodan sahne indirilip yada kopyalanıp kullanılmayacaksa) kullanabilirsiniz.

@Kendin-Yap  evet evet kendim yapacağım uçağı teşekkürler

Uçuş kısmı için yeterli sağlamlığa sahip. Ama düşmelerde kolay kırılabilir tabi ki.

Yes you can

Ahşap dediğin balsa ise çok video var ama normal tahtada çam meşe gurgen vs küçük boyutlarda yapilmaz strafordan yap kolay ve ucuz

The remote control construction and code are in my previous video.

hi daniel carlos this video is in english,but you speak in portuguese

Tenyata ada yg dari indonesia

Aku juga dari Indonesia

all we are muslim brothers

Rasgele değil. Motorun orta kablosu ESC nin orta kablosuna bağlanıyor. Diğer ikisi yönü belirlediği için deneyerek bulabilirsin. Bu standart bir şey olmadığı için denemeden yönü bilmek mümkün değil ve farklı markalarda farklı olur.

Pist İstanbul Model Uçak Kulübü Derneğine aittir. Üyelik gerektiren bir yer. FS-i6 ile  videoda kullandığım alıcı arasında bağlantı farkı bulunmuyor. Kanal sıralaması ve tüm mantık aynıdır.

How much distant can go?

Hocam Drone üreten firmalar daha kalitelisini nasıl daha ucuza sunabiliyor, sadece uçuş kontrolcüsü 750 TL (Vergisiz) 500 TL bandında yaptığınız drone seviyesinde drone'lar var Türkiye'de, gerçekten ilginç.

Bu elleri nerede görsem tanırım 😊😊

Please make drone transmitter and receiver

Alt kısımda sanırım batarya beklenmedik bir inişte komik ve tehlikeli sonuçlar doğurabilir

About 120-150 meters

it is possible. 45, 50 or 55 cm frame...

@Kendin-Yap  sir I was making a 450 quadcopter

@Kendin-Yap  is it work? On 450 drone

Online gan banyak,baru aja aku bikin

Teşekkürler. Bu hobi deneme, yanılma ve tecrübesi olan kişilere danışma ile zaman içerisinde öğrenilir. Bu tip youtube videoları da anlamak öğrenmek için çok faydalıdır. Bir kitabı vs. mevcut değil. basit bir modeli yapmaya çalışmak öğrenmenin en doğru başlangıcı olur. Teknik bir hobi olduğu için süreç içerisinde her deneme bir şeyler öğretir ve bu şekilde devam eder..

Çok teşekkürler abi

@Kendin-Yap  abi birşey soracağim bunları hobi olarak başka yerlerden bağımsız olarakmı öğrendiniz ya da üniversite demi yani üniversite okumuşsanızda hangi bölümü okudunuz söyliyebilirmisiniz ?

bende merak ediyorum

Banggood çok uzun zamandır uluslararası satış yapan büyük bir firma. Yaşanan sorunlar genellikle Banggood dan kaynaklı olmuyor. Yurtdışından ürün size gelirken bir kaç aşamadan geçiyor. Buradaki gümrükte ve ülke içindeki dağıtımlarda sorun yaşanabiliyor. Özet olarak genellikle sorun ürün Türkiye sınırları içine girdiğinde yaşanabiliyor. Videolarımda verdiğim Banggood linkleri İngilizce detaylarda yer alıyor sadece. Normalde yıllardır İngilizce detaylar Türkiye de görünmüyordu. Buradan youtube seyredenler Türkçe başlık, Türkçe detayları görüyordu ve Türkiye deki satıcı linklerini görüyordu. 5-6 haftadır youtube da bir değişiklik veya bir sorun var . Bu yüzden Türkçe dil desteği çalışmıyor ve sadece İngilizce bölüm görünüyor. TR linkleri için detay bölümünde bulunan web siteme bakabilirsiniz. www.rcpano.net Türkiye de malzemelerin çoğunu www.promodelhobby.com da bulabilirsiniz. Yada isimleri ile aratın başka TR alternatifler de çıkacaktır.

Yanlış bir kontrolcünün fiyatına bakıyorsunuz muhtemelen bu uçuş kontrolcüsü KK2.15 dir ve TR de 190-200 tl gibi ortalama bir fiyatı var. Çin sitelerin de ise 95-100 tl ye satılıyor.

Hayır. İleri seviye yarış dronların da bile pili bu şekilde kullanıyoruz. Küçük dronlarda ayak pek kullanılmaz.

Abi 3D yazıcın varsa kendin bir özel tasarım yapıp rc uçak yapabilir misin

It is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Good video!

sonunda attın aradığım videroyu size bir sorum olacak ben maket leri bek yapamıyorum rc uçak maketi olmadı mesela siz yapsanız ben parasını ödesem ve kargoyuda ödesem en azından cevap yaxzın siz satarsanız herkes alacak

Sir, where is the code for the transmitter and receiver? Is it the same code used in the previous video?

Abi ne okudun

Arduino kodları da paylaşma imkanı var mı

vay maşallah bugün başlarsam yaz sonuna kadar ancak bitiririm ben. Kappa :D :ADS

I would like to buy this drone do you wana sell this what the price do you want..

Sir from which are you

Hocam, PI Kazançlarını ayarlarken oto pilot tasarımı size mi ait acaba ? çünkü çok iyi bir şekilde uçuyor harika bir çalışma olmuş.

Please tell me one thing if a use 180 motor ,so there is no need of flight controller , I think so ,please tell me i can use the 180 motor without flight controller

Please make a drone without using flight controller because it is very high rate, I cannot afford it please

Hoca ,eline  koluna sağlık ,,bizleri çook bilgi sahibi ediyorsunuz ,tesekur ederim

Abi yeğenime sadece senin kanalını izleme şartıyla bilgisayara müsade ediyorum.

El drone está excelente y el video está mucho más que bien!!!! 👏👏👏😍Pero no podrías hacer un dron que esté controlado solo por arduino? No importa si es brushless o con motores con escobillas el hecho es que es mas económico de hacer😔🙏🙏 por favor. Por sierto me gusta mucho este canal y todos sus proyectos!! 😍👏👏👏🥇🥇🥇🥇🎊🏆

Sir how to make ppm signal

Abi bu çalışma masandaki yeşil kare kaplama gibi şey ne olarak geçiyor

Abi böyle şeyler görmek çok güzel 👏👏👏

4 gözle bekledim yeni vidonu

oh be sonunda video

Aynısını dicektim

Aynen 3d yazici boyle maketlerde cok is gorur

Rc yapmak öyle kolay değil mesela f22 raptorun rc sini yapacak onun için mini turbo jet motoruna ihtiyacın var anladığım kadarıyla reis elektronikden anlıyor motordan pek anlamıyor

Üzgünüm bu benim hobim sadece. Normal iş hayatım yoğundur. O yüzden bu tip talepler ile ilgilenmem mümkün değil.

canın sağolsun abi bi video çekermisin nasıl maket yapılır diye teknikleri anlatırsan çok sevinirim

Yes, this is the remote I did in the previous video and it uses the same code. Just check the channel directions in the transmitter code. (True or False). Because this is not standard for every ESC.

Okuduğum bölümle hiç bağlantısı yok. Bu benim hobimdir. Kendin zamanla öğrendim .Tabi deneme yanılma ve araştırma...

Kumanda yapımı ve arduino kodları önceki videolarımdadır. İlgili link videonun altındaki açıklama bölümünde mevcuttur. Ayrıca Videonun sonunda çıkan öneri videolarında da linki mevcuttur.

Bitirdin mi kardeşim merak ettim 😂😂

@talhaserin6109  yapamadım :S

@geberrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr   sağlık olsun 😂😂

From Turkey/İstanbul

Uçuş kontrolcü kartı KK2.15 dir ve hazır bir üründür. Ben ayarlarını bu büyüklükteki bir drona göre yaptım. Kol boyu, motor devri, pervane boyu gibi etkenlere göre ayarlar farklılık gösterir.

Flight controllers are a must for this type of drone. The engine does not change this. But not required for fixed-wing normal RC aircraft.

Kesme Matı ismi ile satılıyor

Abi kumandayı nasıl yaptın videosu var mı?

hello sir  can we use 1000kv brushless motor or    30A ESC???

Bu tür videoları bir türkün de çekmesi bizi çok mutlu ediyor.

Nice project. Please make a KK2.15 Flight Canttoller.  You are gnious.

Tebrikler eline emegine saglik👍

Çook iyi fikir helal olsun 😀👍

很厉害啊!!!!

Love from Bangladesh

Very good

good job !!!!

We need more drone related video. Please

Abi ben de uçak yapıcam kameralı onu nasıl yapabilirim az masrafla

Bro very nice Upload to components list and circuit bro 🙂

You are genius dude.  Like this video . 👍👌

That working well

I think this content is similar to what I'm doing, can you preview it through my channel?

Abi daha sık vidyo at

Abi o kablonun yalıtımını çıkarmak için kullandığın alet nedir? Bir de o alıcıyı kendin mi yaptın?

Bende böyle bir video bekliyordum

Good

Kumanda videosu önceki videolarımda var. Bu videonun altındaki açıklama bölümünde de linki var. Ayrıca videonun sonundaki sahne de de kumanda yapımı videosunun küçük resmi ve linki mevcut.

Yes you can. But you should make the body bigger. Because the propellers of the 1000KV motor should be longer.

@Kendin-Yap  THANK YOU SO MUCH

Aynen

Links are in the description box below the video. Press the arrow symbol on the right below the video. (For mobile) Click the "More Information" link below the video. (For PC)

@Kendin-Yap  ok,bro

cotay paowa gay

Kablo sıyırıcı deniyor. Kumanda ve alıcıyı yaptığım videomu önceki videolarımda bulabilirsin. Linki bu videonun altındaki açıklama bölümün de de mevcut.

@Kendin-Yap  Abi toplam maliyet kaç $ tutuyor ortalama?

@KaanCakal  aynen merak ediyorum lütfen söyle

Daha iyi bir uçuş kontrol sistemi ile freestyle  drone videosu bekliyoruz

Awesome dude!!

Thanks for amazing tutorial!

Olum atölyeye baksana çok güzel

Reis harikasın bee

I am a big fan of your channel

Hi

Yes bro so nice video
