00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,820
In this video, we will find out difference between NPN and PNP type transistors and why NPN transistors more often seen in circuits.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Please stay with me in the rest of this video.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,540
BJT transistors fall into two major categories, NPN type and PNP type.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,940
But the main question is why NPN type is more popular?

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,680
Or where should I use NPN type and where should I use PNP type?

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,640
These are very important and confusing questions.

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:38,920
Before answering these questions, we need to know what are transistors used for in circuits.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
This is a good question to start with.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,240
Transistors have two main uses in electronic circuits.

10
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:53,340
Number one, transistors are used for amplifying voltage or current, mostly in analog circuits.

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,620
Number two, transistors are used for switching voltage or current.

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,300
Mostly in digital circuits.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:10,180
Since digital circuits, like microcontroller-based circuits, are more popular these days, we often see the second usage of transistors.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,880
I mean, using transistor as a switch.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,860
Switches are very important because they are most basic components in digital work.

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:22,860
Let's examine how normal switch works before the main subject.

17
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,660
For a switch to work properly, it must be placed between the load and the power supply.

18
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,040
Like this.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,740
No matter the switch is placed in positive side or negative side of power supply.

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,940
But if you need to use a transistor as a switch, it is important to place it in correct side.

21
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,460
Where to place the transistor?

22
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,500
On positive side or negative side?

23
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,780
This is a question that rises from this content.

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,760
Which side of power supply is better to place a transistor?

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,780
Answer of this question is depend on the transistor type you are going to use.

26
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,980
If your transistor is a PNP type, then you have to place it on positive side of power supply.

27
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,140
Like this.

28
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:20,920
And if your transistor is an NPN type, then you have to switch negative side or ground side of power supply.

29
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,300
Like this.

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:30,740
With a little study about BJT transistors, you can learn about them and their four modes of operation.

31
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,860
Saturation, active forward, cutoff and reverse active modes.

32
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:44,700
When the transistor is to be used as a switch in digital circuits, it must be in only two modes of operation.

33
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,460
Cutoff mode, which transistor acts like open circuit when the switch is off.

34
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:58,140
And saturation mode, which transistor acts like short circuit when the switch is on.

35
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:05,980
Transition between these two modes of operation is easy and straightforward in NPN type transistors.

36
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,780
Because of that, NPN type transistors are handier and useful and more seen in nowadays circuits.

37
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,780
You may wonder why switching NPN type transistors are easier than their PNP train.

38
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,680
Let's discuss about it.

39
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:39,000
According to our basic knowledge about BJT transistors, base emitter voltage, base emitter voltage in NPN transistors,

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:52,600
and emitter base voltage in PNP transistors must be more than 0.7 volts to turn the transistor on and take it into forward active or saturation modes.

41
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:58,140
Otherwise, the transistor will fall into cutoff mode and will turn off.

42
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:08,280
In addition, the emitter pin must be connected to power supply and collector pin is always connected to the load in both types.

43
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,520
Look here.

44
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,120
Emitter is connected to power supply.

45
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,940
Emitter is connected to power supply.

46
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,860
And collector is connected to load.

47
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,860
Here and here.

48
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,820
Here and here.

49
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,900
In both types.

50
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,600
Other fact that we know about BJT transistors is that NPN is for switching ground.

51
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,960
Look here.

52
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,700
NPN transistor is switching the ground of load.

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,580
And PNP type transistor is for switching power supply's positive side.

54
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,100
Let's suppose that the load is a 12-volt DC motor.

55
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,880
Because of that, we need a 12-volt power supply.

56
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,080
Emitter pin of NPN transistor must be connected to ground or 0-volt.

57
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,440
And emitter pin of PNP type should be connected to 12 volts.

58
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,020
With these assumptions, if you try to switch the motor using NPN type transistors,

59
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:14,120
you simply need a 0-volt to turn the transistor off and a voltage over than 0.7 volts to turn the transistor on,

60
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,600
which is available on every IOP on any microcontroller.

61
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,700
But if you try to switch the motor using PNP type transistors, I have bad news for you.

62
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Because the transistor will turn on with 11.3 volts or less,

63
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,320
and will turn off with the base voltage over than 11.3 volts.

64
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,940
You can't turn the transistor off using microcontroller.

65
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,220
And of course, you can't stop the DC motor.

66
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,920
Because MCU pins can provide 0 and 3.3 volts or sometimes 5 volts,

67
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,140
which all of these voltages are under 11.3 volts.

68
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,300
And all of these voltages will turn the transistor and then turn the motor on.

69
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:06,420
This is the main reason why NPN transistors are used more than PNP1.

70
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,260
Thanks for watching.
