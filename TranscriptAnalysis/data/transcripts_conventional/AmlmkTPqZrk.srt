00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,740
The FlySky FSIA6B receiver has three types of communication protocols, the classic PWM, and two serial protocols, PPM and IBIS.

2
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:19,560
When this receiver is connected to a flight controller, one of the two serial connections is always used.

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:27,700
The flight controllers have so-called UART serial ports, where one line is used to receive information from the radio,

4
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,020
and another line is used to send information from the controller to the radio.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,740
The first is called the RX line, and the second is called the TX line, or telemetry.

6
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:45,280
The PPM connection is located in the first vertical slot of the receiver.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,460
The upper pin is used to send the information to the controller, and the lower two to supply power to the receiver.

8
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,440
If we are going to use this protocol, it must be previously activated in the radio.

9
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,280
The RX line by IBIS protocol is in the horizontal slot on the right.

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:11,860
The rightmost pin is used to send information to the controller, and the other two pins are used to power the receiver.

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,520
The sending line is connected to some RX pin of the controller.

12
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,400
The TX line by IBIS protocol is in the horizontal slot on the left.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,660
The rightmost pin is used to receive information from the controller, and must be connected to some TX pin of the controller.

14
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,220
The other two pins are used to power the sensors.

15
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,140
Since the controller is already powered, these power pins are not used.

16
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:46,800
In the following example, we send information to the controller through a RX line by the PPM protocol.

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,400
In addition, we receive information from the controller through a TX line by IBIS.

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,460
In the iNAB configurator, the communications for the UART ports are configured.

19
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,820
We use UART2 for the TX line, and UART3 for the RX line.

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,460
We see that the radio sends information of the channel to the controller.

21
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,040
In addition, we see that the radio receives information from some sensors of this controller.

22
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,780
And that is all.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,640
Thank you.

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:18,700
Thank you.
