The coherent topics that can be extracted from this transcript segment are:

1. PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller tuning process:
	* Increasing KP until the output oscillates with some steady state offset
	* Increasing KI to correct the steady state offset, even if it means more oscillation
	* Adjusting KD to remove the oscillations
2. PID controller implementation in code:
	* Setting constants and interval time
	* Calculating each of the PID terms (proportional, integral, derivative)
	* Multiplying each term by its respective K constant and adding them together
3. Real-world applications of PID controllers:
	* Cruise control systems in cars
	* Automatic ship steering
	* Manufacturing and industrial equipment (e.g., reflow ovens)

These topics are discussed throughout the transcript segment, with the first topic being the focus of most of the conversation.
