Code nya apa cuk

Can you give the scheme that project

there is no need a code or what ?

coding pls

and can you share the programming code

what motor did you use for the vacuum

can anyone please give me code for this video and explained to me how to assemble the robot in this video

You didn't  mentioned  the fan thing that you used in this project And please reply as soon as possible  plesse😔

Bisa minta tolong utk ditranslate bahan2 yg dibutuhkan utk membuat vacum cleaner tersebut

what are the items

Nice

bro i made this 69  years ago

How many tips are their

helloo can anyone tell me what parts that they use? because im gonna include this in my research

How it will suck and store in that bottle

Is this a collision avoidance vacuum cleaner? If yes, would you mind sharing the programming code?

If you are an interactive Youtuber who is willing to share thoughts and ideas after making such a wonderful model, you must answer to the questions.  I saw many comments asking for the list of materials used and the codes. But you replied to none of them. This isn't fair. Your subscribers are eager to learn more but you're just ignoring them. This should not be the case. I hope you can definitely share the codes and list of materials. Thank you.

Fake, the ultrasonic is not even connected at 5:31

What's the name of this turn on button?

I can't able to make it

can i see circuit design for this vacuum

Please share the robot coding bro. I really need it 😢

How to start in this one...???

Very simple and useful robot and also easy to make 😊

Can you give a code please

halo mas di

Whats the code for it?

hi... can u share the codding please?

Pls

He is a money sucker and only wants us to see the adverts “cachcows” and not recreate his contraptions 😠

@samuelfellows6923  Right bro. 👍🏻✅

I don’t think 💭 you want much engagement after doing a sweet project like this    You just find it difficult to answer questions like list of major materials used, circuit diagram and code used

I like this robot but can give all material name one by one  🎉

What are the dimensions

please give to code

Your logo is a steal from a swedish child program called bolibompa

AMAZING BROOOO I LIKE THIS 😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍💯💯💯💯💯💯

Can you tell from how you on this

What is the number of ardunio

Super

Can u share code and schematic.What did u use for it. Thank you

Sir please name the sensor

Which motor is that you placed in plastic bottle . Please it is argent

Its an fake video guys the robot is not working automatically as you can see at 5:03 she showed that the sensors are connected with wires but at 5:30 when she removed the body you can clearly see the sensors are disconnected so all that means is its controlled by remote

Really creative

Can you share ardino coding

can you give the link to buy the moter and other sufe

You use Arduino?? Schematic?

Ada guna gear tak?

Can u share the materials and coding?

What is the motor brand & how much rpm does the motor spin

Nice try.

Music htao  aur btado kaise bnana h?

arduino code?

Baaaaaaaaad

Can u make me one

Plz give programing of it

So hard making

2 s so two times 3.7 volt

What is programming or Code ? Here  Why all r asking

Amazing idea. Thanks

Cardboard piece of junk as well as the indian nation

The electronics built in the video aren't what is finally shown to be running. Eg, at 5:32 we see two battery holders, but only one was installed. Furthermore, it's clear that the HC-SR04 isn't hooked up, and due to the way it's mounted, won't allow for as easy access as this purports.

Does this product use a programmer?

AMAZING! LOVE IT

This is very cool thanks for sharing...

Give the code too

what you have used in the plastic cap as a mop pls tell and pls also provide the code for the project. I will be thankfull for you.

nice

Best for mad person

Hi, please give me the code for this project

In this will get help to cleaning the floor

plzzz show me the photo

PROGRAM FOR ARDUINO PLEASE

Wow cool! But what are the electric components?

what is the component that U put on the top of Arduino uno can I know please?

hi can i have the materials list you used, diagram etc...

Where can we get the code?

From where we will get the programing for running the system

are you mad or what?

there were most likely two batteries hooked up do to the induction fan . a single 3.7 volt wont be enough to drive everything  so using  2s  is the way to go

sabes el codigo??????

What is code means ?

@bankerspathshala6588  The code must be provided to Arduino to perform the given task.

Pls have you find the code, i need it for project class

Did u got the program ?

@anjani8732  i don't think he did

I do know . I study robotics

@STR_IKER  could u pls give

​ @STR_IKER  hey plz share the programme

Why can't I watch this video and a speed other than 1x?

WTF

Pleased tell name of materials

This video sucks

Cute

how can we make this project if you dont give us a codeee

This thing sucks (No, but literally!)

0.14 cocaine be like

Which board is that

Shit filter

Lol

WTF

they are intelligent

You cannot create anything new if you never understand how things work...

why don't you try to learn python? There is a lot of helpfull videos on python and do search up how to use motors, a sensor with python on youtube.

@SaritaGundala   woww thanks

Why don't you try to make it huh?

@shobhaojha4984  r/whooosh

how many centimeters is the strip on 0:52

Can you please give me the list if things

Please i want the code because i want to do this for my project

Can i get the codes please

Arduino program code

how much motors we need to use

Is this a vacuum cleaner that avoids collision? if yes do you mind to share the programming code? And is possible if infrared sensor is used instead of  ultra sonic sensor?

just plug it in to arudiono and it'll work! /s

Sir material kya kya hai bta dijiye please

What are the supplies????

Can u share code and schematic. What did u use for it. Thank u

Program please arduino

Gjchlchi

How much did this cost

The Easter version is putting cardboard around a rumba robot or whatever it is called

how did you program the arduino?

How do you supply the vacuum

iam so sick of this tune

Which device is used? And from where did you got it.

Hey does the arduino r3 needs programming

Just make it the width of one full corrugation.  Having multiple corrugations in a strip segment will make it rigid and unable to bend properly.... or unevenly.

Me too

@ajmalbinnizam  did you find the codes guys?

did you find the codes guys?

I mean code

Please i want to do this for my projects

u cant use ir sensor instead f ultrasonic

so it just pulg n play?

Yes

Yesss

Ole bhai

It does not need coding

@dharmpatel4143  youtube it

@Python_Dev-1  if you can't explain and teach your followers then why are you here begging for subs and likes only?

@nightvoyager1  you know what, did you  think that I am a programmer who doesn't know a thing 🤔

@nightvoyager1  i have gave him the idea that you are saying I don't know.And you don't know the really struggle of editing, shooting youtube videos.BECAUSE I know that you are a youtuber who don't even put your hardwork in YOUR OWN CHANNEL. You just copy someothers youtube video, hardwork and post it on your channel 🤣.Don't you even have shame at yourself 🤭

@nightvoyager1  hope you would reply

Still waiting for your REPLY !😇

Yes

Barxxo i wasn’t until i saw your comment 😫

Of cause! It's a MICROCONTROLLER! ;-)

WHICH IS THE BGM SONG USED HERE?

Can you send one of those Kitty vacuum cleaner over here 2114 Allentown Road

whats the name of that thing 2:12

Your build is a bit 'unreal'. The setup which you showed in minutes 4:48 has ultrasonic sensor connected to arduino. However, the demo on minute 5:09 onward showed (when you opened the robot) that you did not use arduino, the ultrasonic sensor was not connected to anything. Could you explain why the demo build on minute 5:09 did not use arduino? It was a different 'robot'.

pliss show how to do it

Great Job

does this arduino uno needs programming and which arduino you  have  used

Damn dude if you’re not going to talk in the vid can we at least get a blueprint in the description w steps and the exact parts you used. Almost subbed 😔
