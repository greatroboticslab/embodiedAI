      "coverage_text": "A few weeks ago, Mark Roper released a video showing these really cool zipline drones that\ndeliver medical supplies in Rwanda. As cool as this is, he kind of glossed over one of the most\ninteresting features of these drones. Look at these propellers. He mentions that they're shaped like\nthat to reduce the noise, but why does this happen? And what is it about the shape that reduces the\nnoise? The internet right now is just buzzing, waiting for someone to make a 3D printable version\nof these to see how much quieter they actually are. And that's exactly what I have here. But before\nwe listen to these, let me explain why these propellers are shaped this way in the first place.\nWhat actually makes sound when a propeller spins really fast? Well, as the blades move past by a\nstationary point, it creates a pressure disturbance that propagates away from the blade. The frequency\nthat this happens is called the blade passage frequency, and it's equal to the rotational\nfrequency, so how fast the propeller's spinning, times the number of blades on the propeller. So\nlet's say that we have a propeller that has four blades. The traditional way to make these is to\nspace them evenly so that they're 90 degrees apart. When you have a propeller shaped like this, it creates\na lot of different frequencies, but it creates a loud frequency at the blade passage frequency, but also\nit creates frequencies at the harmonics of the blade passage frequency. So if you take an audio recording",

      "coverage_text": "of this, you'll see peaks at the whole number multiples of the blade passage frequency. But\nsomething really interesting happens if you don't space out the blades evenly. So let's say instead\nof having the blades spaced 90 degrees apart, we space them 30 degrees apart only. So there's now a large\ngap and then a small gap between them, so they aren't evenly spaced. Well then when you record the sound,\nyou get the normal harmonics like before with one, two, three times the blade passage frequency,\nbut you also get 0.5 times the blade passage frequency and 1.5 and 2.5. So for the same\nacoustic energy, you're spreading out some of the sound into lower frequencies. The most important\nfrequency is the one that's generated, which has half the frequency of the blade passage frequency.\nYou can see this here. So first we'll start with this four blade propeller. I have these little\nreflective strips on here so I can measure the RPM. So how many times per second that it's spinning\naround in a circle? So we're at around 1200 RPM right now. So around 85 Hertz is one of the loudest\nfrequencies here. But now if I switch out these propellers to around a 30 degree propeller,\nlet's get it to the same RPM. So that's almost exactly the same RPM around 1200. The other one is around 1249.\nSo they're going the same speed now, but let's measure one of the loudest frequencies. So this is crazy.\nWe're going the same speed with four propellers, but the loudest frequency coming off here is half the\nfrequency of the propeller that has the evenly spaced blades. So it's picking up a lower frequency.\nThe higher one is still there, but the energy is shared between the two frequencies. So what does that do for us?",

      "coverage_text": "Well, humans are less sensitive to low frequency sounds. So we perceive them as quieter than they actually are.\nSo what this means is that when you space the blades unevenly, it creates a lower frequency that we perceive as quieter.\nAnd this fact has been known for a long time. For example, there are cooling fans and helicopter rotors that use uneven blade spacing.\nBut this design still doesn't quite look like the zip line design that we saw from Mark Rober's video.\nWhy is there this gap between the blades so that they're on different levels?\nWell, when you have a propeller design like this, there's an interaction that happens where the blades overlap.\nThis causes a lot of broadband noise, meaning just a large spread of many frequencies through the spectrum.\nSo any noise reduction that you gain with the uneven blade spacing gets canceled out with this broadband noise that's created.\nBut if you just get rid of that overlap by raising one of the blades a little bit higher than the other one, then the broadband noise just goes away.\nSo an easy way to create this is just to take two double blade propellers and stack them on top of each other.\nSo I've made two propellers here. These are taken from an FPV airplane propeller that I have.\nOkay, so what I have here are two different spacings of blades stacked on top of each other.\nAnd I put a little sticker on each of them so that I can measure the rotational rate, the RPMs as they're spinning to get them at the same RPM.\nOkay, so I'm going to turn both of them on.\n10,300 RPM.\nAnd this one's at 10,000 RPM.\n10,200 RPM.\nSo they're really close to the same RPM.\nOkay, let's listen to both of their sounds.\nNow in front.\n10,300 RPM.\nNow behind.\nThe high pitch tones are still there with this one, but they're a lot less because of the acoustic noise has been spread out to that lower frequency as well as the high one.\nWhereas this one has most of the high ones.\nYou can see that the uneven space blades have a noticeably lower tone than the evenly spaced one.\nWhat that amounts to is that it sounds quieter and not quite as annoying as the regularly spaced one.\nSo Zipline has made a version of the uneven space blades, but instead of including the four blades, they just have the two of them with a counterbalance on the other side.\nSo it sounds like this.\nNow mine isn't perfectly balanced, so it doesn't sound a lot quieter.\nI'd love for someone to make a better version of this in real life that uses the same design as Zipline.\nAlso a few months ago, MIT came up with a propeller called the toroidal propeller.\nThis is the two blade version.\nAnd then this is the three blade version.",
