[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:10.800] Hello guys and welcome back to my channel. Today I'm going to check a new DJI-friendly F7 flight
[00:00:10.800 → 00:00:17.540] controller and a very capable 20x20mm stack by T-Motor. In this video I'm going to go over their
[00:00:17.540 → 00:00:22.160] features and specs and show you how to set them up using both digital and analog systems.
[00:00:22.980 → 00:00:29.760] First let's start with the 20x20mm stack. In terms of packaging, inside the box you can find the
[00:00:29.760 → 00:00:38.960] flight controller. The 4-in-1 ESC which comes with a pre-soldered 35V 470μF capacitor. A bag with M3
[00:00:38.960 → 00:00:46.340] screws, nuts and silicone grammets. A high quality XT60 battery connector with pre-soldered 14G silicone
[00:00:46.340 → 00:00:53.020] coated wires. A harness for connecting the 4-in-1 ESC and the flight controller and a GST connector
[00:00:53.020 → 00:00:59.060] that will enable you to easily connect a DJI air unit. In terms of specs, the flight controller
[00:00:59.060 → 00:01:07.440] features an F7 processor, 5 full U-out ports, in addition to a 5V BEC, a 10V BEC which is useful
[00:01:07.440 → 00:01:14.140] for powering a DJI air unit and a dedicated connector for hooking it up. As for the 4-in-1 ESC,
[00:01:14.420 → 00:01:21.480] its current rating is 45A, it features well-separated motor and battery pads, a built-in current sensor,
[00:01:21.480 → 00:01:28.360] it's running BLL32 firmware and just like the flight controller, it can be powered with up to 6S batteries.
[00:01:29.160 → 00:01:35.860] In addition, the weight of the flight controller is 5.3 grams. The weight of the 4-in-1 ESC including the
[00:01:35.860 → 00:01:44.420] capacitor is 10.9 grams. They are both using 20x20mm M3 mounting holes. The outer dimensions of the flight
[00:01:44.420 → 00:01:53.480] controller are 27.7 x 29.9 x 6.4 millimeters. The 4-in-1 ESC is a little bit bigger and its outer
[00:01:53.480 → 00:02:01.760] dimensions are 33.4 x 39.3 x 6.4 millimeters and the total weight of the stack including the GST
[00:02:01.760 → 00:02:08.160] harness is 17.1 grams. Now let's quickly go over a couple of guidelines when installing the stack.
[00:02:08.160 → 00:02:14.700] Next to the micro USB port, you can find dedicated pads for connecting a ready receiver and you can
[00:02:14.700 → 00:02:20.760] choose whether to power the ready receiver using 3.3 or 5 volts by bridging the center pad with the
[00:02:20.760 → 00:02:25.340] right one or with the left one. Pay attention that if you are going to leave it unbridged,
[00:02:25.780 → 00:02:31.640] the ready receiver is not going to be powered up. The easiest way to connect the DJI air unit to the
[00:02:31.640 → 00:02:37.500] flight controller is using the provided GST connector. The air unit is going to be powered using the 10V
[00:02:37.500 → 00:02:44.060] BAC. In order to display the OSD data, you need to enable the MSP switch on UART3 and pay attention
[00:02:44.060 → 00:02:49.240] that in case you are going to use an external ready receiver, you need to disconnect the yellow wire as
[00:02:49.240 → 00:02:54.800] it is wired to UART1. On the back of the flight controller, you can find the relevant pads for
[00:02:54.800 → 00:03:01.960] connecting an analog VTX and in case you would like to control the 10V BAC using an auxiliary switch,
[00:03:02.380 → 00:03:07.440] you can solder these two pads over here and then assign an auxiliary switch to the user
[00:03:07.440 → 00:03:13.040] one mod on bit of light. Pay attention that this feature only applies to the 10V pads,
[00:03:13.380 → 00:03:18.680] which means that in case you would like to use it, you can't use VTXs that only support a DC input
[00:03:18.680 → 00:03:25.140] voltage of 5V. Here you can see what it looks like when the stack is assembled. So it features a slim
[00:03:25.140 → 00:03:30.740] home factor and it is quite remarkable that such a small stack can power a 5-inch 6S build.
[00:03:31.340 → 00:03:36.220] Now let's move on to the newly introduced single-sided Pacer F7 flight controller,
[00:03:36.680 → 00:03:41.900] which actually came as a part of this plug-and-play build, which as far as I know is still not available.
[00:03:42.600 → 00:03:48.720] In terms of specs, this flight controller features an F7 processor, a USB Type-C connector,
[00:03:48.720 → 00:03:57.160] 6 full UO ports, a dedicated connector for a DJI air unit. In addition to a 10-pin-suggester connector
[00:03:57.160 → 00:04:02.340] for connecting the flight controller with the 4-in-1 ESC, you can find the matching pads on the
[00:04:02.340 → 00:04:08.020] bottom of the flight controller. Most of the pads can be accessed from both top and bottom sides of
[00:04:08.020 → 00:04:14.460] the flight controller. On its bottom, there are no electronic parts and pay attention that it only features
[00:04:14.460 → 00:04:21.260] a 5V BAC and all the 10V pads are just pass-through pads, which rely on the fact that you are going
[00:04:21.260 → 00:04:30.260] to use a 4-in-1 ESC, which features a built-in 10V BAC. In addition, the flight controller is using 30.5 by
[00:04:30.260 → 00:04:40.740] 30.5 mm M3 mounting holes. It weighs 8 grams and its outer dimensions are 40.1 by 39.2 by 7.8 mm.
[00:04:40.740 → 00:04:46.840] In case you are going to use a DJI air unit and connect it to the dedicated connector, pay attention
[00:04:46.840 → 00:04:51.820] that in case you are going to use a 6-pin GST connector, it is connected all the way to the right,
[00:04:52.180 → 00:04:58.880] as the left pin is an extra ground pin which is not in use. In order to display the OSD data on your DJI
[00:04:58.880 → 00:05:05.920] goggles, you need to enable the MSP switch on your 3D. And remember that as I just mentioned, the 10V pad
[00:05:05.920 → 00:05:12.460] is just a pass-through, so in case you are not going to use a supported 4-in-1 ESC, the DJI air unit is not
[00:05:12.460 → 00:05:18.440] going to be powered up, so what you can do is to bridge the VBAT and 10V pads, but keep in mind
[00:05:18.440 → 00:05:24.300] that the DJI air unit can be powered directly with up to 4S batteries. As for the rest of the setup,
[00:05:24.740 → 00:05:28.940] you can wire the ready receiver to the pads which are located on the back of the flight controller,
[00:05:28.940 → 00:05:35.180] and then power it either using 3.3 or 5V. Pay attention that in case you are going to use an
[00:05:35.180 → 00:05:42.020] S-Bus receiver, you will need to use the RX5 pin of the DJI air unit connector. Finally, in case you
[00:05:42.020 → 00:05:47.900] are going to use an analog setup, the VTX and FEB camera are going to be wired to the pads which are
[00:05:47.900 → 00:05:53.640] located on the front of the flight controller. You can power them either using 10V, 5V and VBAT,
[00:05:53.640 → 00:05:59.980] and in addition you can also find a dedicated pad for camera control for configuring an analog FPV camera.
[00:06:00.900 → 00:06:06.400] So overall, the T-Motor Pacer F7 flight controller looks like a pretty good option for a DJI air unit
[00:06:06.400 → 00:06:13.060] setup, but keep in mind that you need to match it with a compatible 4-in-1 ESC since it lakes a 10V BC.
[00:06:14.220 → 00:06:19.100] As for the mini stack, as far as I can tell it looks like a pretty good option for a light 5-inch
[00:06:19.100 → 00:06:24.560] build. Its main downside, which is subjective, is that it's a little bit on the pricey side
[00:06:24.560 → 00:06:29.700] since it costs around $100 and soon I'm going to feature it in a build-in-flight video,
[00:06:29.940 → 00:06:34.700] so we'll see how it goes. Anyway, that's going to be it for this quick video. As always,
