As the video continued, he showed how he attached a servo motor to the base so that the tri-copter would spin as it was moving through the air. Although this system was much more complex in terms of stability, the power needed for the drown to hover in the air was significantly decreased. This can be very useful to extend the battery life of the drone and allow the user to fly the drone for much longer than the original build of the drone.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JH1_ZKV7t4: The Spinning Drone Paradox - Part 1"}]}
