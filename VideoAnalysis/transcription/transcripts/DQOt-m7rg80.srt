Hello everybody out there in newbie land like I am just learning everything about droning

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:26,100
I guess you would call it got my wizard here and I've been recently wanting to move away from

3
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:35,640
switch arming on a single switch to I think stinger swarm is a one of the youtubers that I noticed

4
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:47,800
that was arming on multiple switches and so I just wanted to share with everyone how to actually set

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:57,740
that up so first of all in your transmitter you need to go in here and change your aux channels

6
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:04,720
so on this one I actually have the upgraded firmware so it can do up to 10 channels but you may only

7
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,700
have the six channels so your first four channels are these channels you know your throttle your yaw

8
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,200
and your pitch in your roll that's channel one through four so you really only have two other

9
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,580
channels to mess with on stock firmware and I only have a six channel receiver in here although I am

10
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:31,120
using it with iBus so I can use all 10 channels anyways I believe these are the defaults I tried

11
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,980
to set this back to default because I kind of already went through all this just to make sure it would

12
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:45,220
work and it does so I just want to show you guys how to do it basically I want to hit both of these

13
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,440
switches to arm so that was out of focus but basically to arm the quad I want to have to hit

14
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:59,840
both of these switches I want both down to arm I want if only this one is down I want it to beep

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:10,580
and if only this one is down nothing happens right so before I just had this to arm and I had this

16
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:25,840
for my modes you know I had angle and horizon and then acro you got to start by changing channel five

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,580
and six we're just going to pretend like those are the only two channels that exist here so I want

18
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:41,020
switch a and b to be on channel five so to do that you go into your aux channels and you just push

19
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:47,820
this until it says switch a plus b switch a plus b actually before I do that let me show you this let's

20
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:57,300
go into the display and you can see here this is channel five this is channel six channel seven okay

21
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,900
channel eight this is nine and ten okay so you can see all that on the display you can see how it works

22
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,060
there so this switch is full off full on so the throttle value or the the value is one thousand and two

23
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:18,060
thousand that's all you get right there so when we change it here in the aux channels what we're doing

24
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:28,380
is saying that we want to so when we change it here in the transmitter we go into channel five and we want

25
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:38,020
to set this to be switch a plus b okay and we want channel six to be on this switch so we're going to set that

26
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:49,360
one to switch C so there we go and we don't want switch C to also be on channel eight I mean I guess

27
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:55,840
it doesn't matter you don't have to get rid of these but I like to just kind of get rid of these so if

28
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:07,060
we keep going back I can put these all here like that so those things will be controlling the switches are

29
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,220
only going to affect channel five and six that doesn't actually affect anything if we don't set

30
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:20,400
it up in beta flight so now that we have that set up with aux five and a and b you can see here that

31
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:30,280
when we hit switch a we're only getting I don't know maybe 1350 on the value there or 1400 probably and

32
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:40,300
when we only hit this one we're only getting maybe 1600 or 17 maybe so both of them up and we have a

33
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:48,440
throw a value of a thousand on channel five both of them down we have a value of 2000 on channel five

34
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:58,880
and then this one is you know 1500 and 2000 because that's a three position switch so we're basically

35
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,780
getting four positions with these two switches now these two switches are affecting one channel and

36
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:13,300
giving us four different positions to choose from and we're really only going to need three one is going

37
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:23,740
to be beeper not armed and the other one is going to be not armed and not beeper and then last not beeper

38
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:32,140
and not and and armed so those are the only three states that we're really looking for so let's go ahead

39
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:45,160
over to beta flight and we'll see what that looks like in beta flight so here let me plug in I'm gonna

40
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:56,820
plug in the quad there we go and I'm actually gonna plug in the lipo as well so that we have the receiver

41
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:04,020
powered all right so here we are in beta flight and we're just gonna connect up and you can see if

42
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:12,440
we go over to the receiver tab here that you'll notice that if I flip switch one see the value we're

43
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:23,340
getting is 1333 there and then if I flip switch to 1667 there so and then if we flip both 2000 is the

44
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:32,340
power value so that's how we can have two switches affect one channel it's basically just four positions here we got

45
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:36,340
two times two so

46
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:44,340
one thousand thirteen thirty three sixteen sixty seven and two thousand those are the all four options

47
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:56,580
so to set this up in beta flight to do double switch arming all's we got to do is go into the modes tab

48
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:05,220
under arm you're going to add a range and this is channel one or ox one which is really channel five

49
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:12,240
that that might be confusing but that's how it works so ox one and we don't want it to arm unless we're way

50
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,720
up here and we don't want it to be down here in 1667 range which we're not I don't believe yeah that's

51
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:28,260
1500 there so we're just gonna slide up and why isn't it letting me make that smaller that's fine I guess

52
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,800
that's fine all right so save we are armed yeah we should probably unarm hello that was scary I did not

53
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,280
expect that all right so here we are unarmed and no beeper so how do we add the beeper

54
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:52,120
we want this range right here add range ox one there we go we want into this range but we don't really

55
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,100
care about anything else and it's down here we don't want it and of course when it's up here we don't want

56
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:05,840
it right so save uh yeah you probably shouldn't do this with props on I'm just terrible at my job here

57
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:17,580
so anyways that's that's all there is to that so yeah let's go ahead and set up the um modes or the uh

58
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:25,120
angle mode at least so we're going to put this on ox two and that's going to be right there at the

59
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:40,380
beginning and then horizon ox two in the middle there and then that will be angle mode so that's how

60
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:49,900
easy that is anyways thanks for watching and I hope this uh taught you something that you didn't already

61
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,200
know
