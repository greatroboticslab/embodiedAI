The only overlap is the presence of numbers (STA 182) in the title and video name, which is not enough to establish strong", "comment": "From this video I have learned how to hook up multiple speakers to one amplifier. In the first video I watched it was a video using the TPA3110 amplifier and eight speakers. The video started with two speakers being hooked up and the sound tested. The TPA3110 allows for a left and right speaker. This would definitely be helpful for the set up that Erik and I are trying to do because we have a total of five speakers, two tweeters, two woofers, and a subwoofer. If we could split the two tweeters and two woofers to be a left and a right set for each then it would allow sound to play in stereo instead of mono. The subwoofer would be in mono but that should not be an issue because very rarely is bass recorded in stereo. As the video progresses, he continues to add more speakers. He wired his in parallel I believe but at one point it appeared that he was wiring some of them in series. It was really interesting to see eight speakers hooked up to the same amplifier. It makes me curious if the same could be said of the TDA2030A. I know if we used the headphone jack, we can still do the speakers in stereo because there is a left input and a write input. So, we will just need to put one tweeter and one woofer to the right input and one tweeter and on woofer to the left input, the subwoofer will need to go to both inputs to make it mono. After doing more research on the subwoofer I found out that both sides of the subwoofer needs to be wired in series to itself so this video helped me figure that out. The only confusion I have was whether the speakers were hooked up in series or parallel.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHwSIcIdeDI : Class d amplifier sound test | TPA 3110 bass test"}]}
