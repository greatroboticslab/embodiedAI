[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:05.180] We're going through Betaflight 4.3 Configurator, looking at every single option, telling you what
[00:00:05.180 → 00:00:10.100] it is and how to set it up so you know what to do the next time you encounter it. In today's video,
[00:00:10.260 → 00:00:16.200] we are looking at the Motors tab. If you came here for the Motors tab, then stick around. But if you
[00:00:16.200 → 00:00:20.340] somehow just stumbled across this video and you want to learn more about Betaflight Configurator,
[00:00:20.760 → 00:00:25.420] there's a playlist in the video description. You can start with video number one and go from there.
[00:00:26.060 → 00:00:29.680] Let's get on to the Motors tab. And the first option we're going to look at here is the Mixer.
[00:00:29.680 → 00:00:35.180] And the Mixer tells the Flight Controller how many motors there are, where those motors are
[00:00:35.180 → 00:00:40.900] located in space, and what direction those motors are going to be spinning. And the reason the Flight
[00:00:40.900 → 00:00:46.800] Controller needs to know this is the Flight Controller's job is to translate your stick inputs
[00:00:46.800 → 00:00:52.620] into movement of the quadcopter. So if you push the roll stick to the left, the Flight Controller
[00:00:52.620 → 00:00:58.800] knows the quadcopter needs to roll to the left, and it needs to know which motors it needs to speed up
[00:00:58.800 → 00:01:04.900] and slow down to cause the quadcopter to roll to the left. Now the most common mixer you're going to
[00:01:04.900 → 00:01:11.080] see is probably Quad X. That's what almost everybody is probably flying. But we can see that there are
[00:01:11.080 → 00:01:17.920] many different mixers that Betaflight supports. An A-tail Quad, even some fixed-wing mixers. I have to say,
[00:01:18.480 → 00:01:25.180] Betaflight's support for fixed-wing and servos is extremely poor. It just is an afterthought that
[00:01:25.180 → 00:01:29.860] hasn't received much development at all, and it can be very difficult to get servos and airplanes
[00:01:29.860 → 00:01:33.700] working with Betaflight. If you really want to build an airplane with a Flight Controller,
[00:01:34.140 → 00:01:38.800] strongly recommend using iNav instead of Betaflight. As we come down through the list,
[00:01:38.880 → 00:01:43.780] there are some layouts that have more than four motors. Here's a hexacopter mixer. Here is a
[00:01:44.780 → 00:01:51.180] octocopter mixer. There is an X8 octocopter mixer, where you have four... We have eight motors,
[00:01:51.180 → 00:01:56.780] but there are two of them are co-located with each other, and so on, and so on. There's a bunch
[00:01:56.780 → 00:02:01.580] of different mixers that you could theoretically be using. We're going to go back to the Quad X mixer
[00:02:01.580 → 00:02:06.960] that probably almost everybody is using. And the next option we're going to look at is this one,
[00:02:07.260 → 00:02:12.920] Motor Direction is Reversed. I want you to look at this diagram here and look at which direction
[00:02:12.920 → 00:02:18.860] the motors are spinning. Because one of the easiest mistakes you can make when setting up a quadcopter is
[00:02:18.860 → 00:02:24.020] to have one or more of the motors spinning the wrong direction. And a lot of times when I troubleshoot this with people,
[00:02:24.340 → 00:02:28.220] I'll say, are your motors spinning the right direction? And they'll go, yes, I double checked them.
[00:02:28.520 → 00:02:33.840] And it turns out you double checked them from memory, but like the Flight Controller doesn't agree with your memory,
[00:02:33.840 → 00:02:39.760] and so it can't fly correctly. So whenever you're checking your motor direction, always do it based on the diagram
[00:02:39.760 → 00:02:44.720] that the Flight Controller is giving you. And if we look at what this option does,
[00:02:44.720 → 00:02:50.700] motor direction is reversed, it switches the direction of all of the motors. So a lot of people would consider
[00:02:50.700 → 00:02:58.280] normal direction to be props in, they call it, and motor direction is reversed would be props out.
[00:02:58.500 → 00:03:03.520] There's pros and cons to each, and which one you want to choose is not really the topic of this video.
[00:03:03.680 → 00:03:08.900] But the key thing you need to know is that this option does not reverse the motors.
[00:03:08.900 → 00:03:14.760] So a real common mistake people make is they flip this option, they mean for the motors to be spinning props out,
[00:03:14.880 → 00:03:18.980] but the motors are actually spinning props in, and then they get confused when their quadcopter won't fly.
[00:03:19.400 → 00:03:27.340] This tells the Flight Controller what direction you intend for the motors to go. It doesn't make the motors go that direction.
[00:03:27.540 → 00:03:32.020] Now in order to make the motors spin, we have to choose an ESC and motor protocol.
[00:03:32.020 → 00:03:36.880] And the most common one that people are going to be using today is DSHOT.
[00:03:37.260 → 00:03:42.680] There are three variants of DSHOT here in Betaflight, DSHOT 150, 300, and 600.
[00:03:42.960 → 00:03:49.280] DSHOT is a digital protocol that is used to communicate between the Flight Controller and the ESC.
[00:03:49.500 → 00:03:55.280] And it essentially tells the ESC how fast that the Flight Controller wants the motor to be spinning.
[00:03:55.720 → 00:03:57.520] But DSHOT can do more than that.
[00:03:57.520 → 00:04:08.520] DSHOT can also carry digital commands to do things like reverse the motors that normally would have required you to hook up to the ESC and use a configurator or something.
[00:04:09.020 → 00:04:15.440] So DSHOT carries the throttle signal and DSHOT commands which can tell the ESC to do certain things.
[00:04:15.680 → 00:04:22.700] Now the three variants of DSHOT, DSHOT 150, 300, and 600, relate to how fast the packets are sent.
[00:04:22.700 → 00:04:27.820] DSHOT 600 is the fastest that Betaflight supports. DSHOT 150 is the slowest.
[00:04:28.280 → 00:04:32.760] And you might think, well, of course I want the fastest, right? Isn't faster better?
[00:04:33.060 → 00:04:40.020] And it is true that DSHOT 600 will have lower latency from the Flight Controller to the ESC than DSHOT 150.
[00:04:40.340 → 00:04:48.600] The disadvantage of the higher DSHOTs is that, well, if you go back far enough, some ESCs just didn't support the faster ones.
[00:04:48.600 → 00:04:56.280] That's not true anymore. Essentially, all modern ESCs support DSHOT 600 and even higher, although Betaflight doesn't go any higher than 600.
[00:04:56.640 → 00:04:59.120] But all ESCs can support DSHOT 600.
[00:04:59.120 → 00:05:11.300] The main reason that you might choose a slower one is if you have had to reduce your PID loop rate for some reason, which we'll talk about in another video,
[00:05:11.540 → 00:05:21.080] 8K PID loop DSHOT 600 is sort of the right one to choose because the latency of DSHOT 600 is similar to the latency of the 8K PID loop.
[00:05:21.240 → 00:05:28.240] If you're running a 4K PID loop, then DSHOT, there isn't a lot of benefit to using DSHOT 600, and you may as well use DSHOT 300.
[00:05:28.240 → 00:05:32.040] And if you went down to 2K, I suppose you would use DSHOT 150.
[00:05:32.320 → 00:05:35.320] So the DSHOT that you choose depends on your PID loop rate.
[00:05:35.560 → 00:05:43.540] The other thing to keep in mind is sometimes if your motor signals are getting corrupted, like your ESCs don't start up at the same time,
[00:05:43.600 → 00:05:49.000] you hear doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, they're sort of out of sync,
[00:05:49.400 → 00:05:55.960] then dropping down from DSHOT 600 to 300 can make the signal a little bit more robust and solve that problem.
[00:05:55.960 → 00:05:59.320] But generally, you'll choose your DSHOT based on your PID loop rate.
[00:05:59.540 → 00:06:01.940] Continuing to work our way down here, motor stop.
[00:06:02.100 → 00:06:07.500] Normally, when you arm a freestyle quad or racing quad, the motors begin spinning immediately.
[00:06:08.060 → 00:06:11.920] That is not how camera platforms usually work.
[00:06:12.300 → 00:06:15.140] With camera platforms, the way it usually works is you arm the quad,
[00:06:15.140 → 00:06:19.660] and then when you raise the throttle, it starts the motors and begins to take off.
[00:06:20.380 → 00:06:23.980] If you want to emulate that behavior, you can enable motor stop,
[00:06:24.200 → 00:06:28.460] and then the quad will not spin the motors until you raise the throttle.
[00:06:28.900 → 00:06:29.540] Don't do this.
[00:06:29.780 → 00:06:35.500] If you're new to freestyle quads and racing quads, it may seem a little bit weird, but this is just how we do it.
[00:06:35.620 → 00:06:38.140] And the reason we do it this way is that when you're flying,
[00:06:38.280 → 00:06:40.640] quite a lot of the time with a freestyle and racing drone,
[00:06:40.920 → 00:06:43.080] you will drop the throttle all the way down to zero.
[00:06:43.080 → 00:06:46.780] And if you have motor stop enabled, when you do that,
[00:06:46.920 → 00:06:50.100] the quad will stop the motors and fall out of the air, and you'll lose control.
[00:06:50.460 → 00:06:52.400] With camera platforms, you don't do that.
[00:06:52.500 → 00:06:55.280] You've always got the throttle raised until the moment that you land.
[00:06:55.540 → 00:06:58.420] So don't use motor stop unless you're building a camera platform,
[00:06:58.540 → 00:07:00.580] in which case, why are you using Betaflight?
[00:07:01.760 → 00:07:02.820] Anyway, that's up to you.
[00:07:03.100 → 00:07:05.540] Now, though we're not talking about the configuration tab yet,
[00:07:05.620 → 00:07:07.760] there is one thing I need to show you,
[00:07:07.820 → 00:07:12.440] and that is if in the configuration tab you have air mode enabled,
[00:07:12.440 → 00:07:15.180] then motor stop will have no effect.
[00:07:15.360 → 00:07:18.740] It will still be here, but it will always be disabled.
[00:07:19.560 → 00:07:21.400] Air mode overrides motor stop.
[00:07:21.740 → 00:07:23.820] So if you're trying to get motor stop to work,
[00:07:24.120 → 00:07:27.420] and it's not having any effect, it may be because air mode is enabled.
[00:07:27.580 → 00:07:28.100] What's air mode?
[00:07:28.180 → 00:07:30.760] Well, we'll talk about that when we get to the configuration tab.
[00:07:30.900 → 00:07:31.780] ESC sensor.
[00:07:31.780 → 00:07:36.100] If you have an ESC that does BL-Heli32 ESC telemetry,
[00:07:36.480 → 00:07:40.060] ESC sensor tells the flight controller that that is going to be the case.
[00:07:40.480 → 00:07:42.840] And then when you enable ESC sensor,
[00:07:43.120 → 00:07:46.480] you also have the option here in the power and battery tab
[00:07:46.480 → 00:07:50.960] to choose ESC sensor as your current and your voltage meter source.
[00:07:51.080 → 00:07:54.760] So you can get battery voltage and current data from the ESC.
[00:07:54.760 → 00:07:59.440] There's a reason why I don't think this is useful for most people.
[00:07:59.780 → 00:08:02.320] I've got a video about why BL-Heli32 telemetry.
[00:08:02.740 → 00:08:04.200] I'm not too concerned about it.
[00:08:04.280 → 00:08:06.540] I'll put it down in the video description if you want to check it out.
[00:08:06.820 → 00:08:08.820] But if you are trying to use it,
[00:08:09.160 → 00:08:13.060] you will need to enable that option here in this tab.
[00:08:13.300 → 00:08:15.440] Next, we come to bidirectional D-shot.
[00:08:15.580 → 00:08:18.520] This is potentially one of the most important options
[00:08:18.520 → 00:08:22.840] you can enable in order to get the best flight performance out of your quadcopter.
[00:08:22.840 → 00:08:28.540] Bidirectional D-shot allows the ESC to send motor RPM
[00:08:28.540 → 00:08:32.140] back to the flight controller with extremely low latency.
[00:08:32.440 → 00:08:36.300] What that means is that the flight controller can filter out the motor RPM
[00:08:36.300 → 00:08:40.340] and get rid of that vibration or noise, as we say, very effectively.
[00:08:40.680 → 00:08:43.860] You absolutely want bidirectional D-shot if your ESC supports it.
[00:08:43.980 → 00:08:49.120] All BL-Heli32 ESCs from firmware 32.7 and newer support bidirectional D-shot,
[00:08:49.120 → 00:08:53.460] which any ESC you buy today, any BL-Heli32 ESC is going to support that.
[00:08:54.000 → 00:08:56.780] And BL-Heli S-ESCs don't support it,
[00:08:56.920 → 00:09:00.920] but there is a firmware called BlueJ you can flash to most BL-Heli S-ESCs
[00:09:00.920 → 00:09:04.020] that enables bidirectional D-shot, and I highly advise you to do that.
[00:09:04.380 → 00:09:06.160] I have a video about how to flash BlueJ,
[00:09:06.360 → 00:09:08.340] and I'll put it in the video description as well.
[00:09:08.720 → 00:09:10.720] You definitely want this enabled.
[00:09:10.940 → 00:09:12.800] If you enable bidirectional D-shot,
[00:09:12.800 → 00:09:16.360] then you're also going to see this motor poles option appear.
[00:09:16.820 → 00:09:20.100] In order for bidirectional D-shot and RPM filtering to work correctly,
[00:09:20.340 → 00:09:23.840] the flight controller needs to know how many magnets your motor has.
[00:09:24.220 → 00:09:28.380] The number is going to be 14 for typical 5-inch, 6-inch, 7-inch,
[00:09:28.460 → 00:09:29.980] and even a little bit smaller motors.
[00:09:30.100 → 00:09:33.060] But if you're uncertain, just literally pick the quad up,
[00:09:33.420 → 00:09:35.600] turn it over, rotate the motor in your hands,
[00:09:35.680 → 00:09:38.200] and count the magnets on the inside of the bell.
[00:09:38.460 → 00:09:41.180] Next, we come to the motor idle percent value.
[00:09:41.180 → 00:09:44.340] And this is the lowest throttle value
[00:09:44.340 → 00:09:46.460] that the flight controller will send to the motors.
[00:09:46.820 → 00:09:50.100] The idea is that if the throttle value sent to the motors is too low,
[00:09:50.220 → 00:09:52.080] the motor will stall and stutter,
[00:09:52.260 → 00:09:55.080] and if that happens in flight, the quad could fall out of the air.
[00:09:55.280 → 00:09:59.760] So you need to have a minimum idle value that keeps the motor moving,
[00:10:00.120 → 00:10:03.500] even under sort of adverse airflow conditions.
[00:10:03.700 → 00:10:07.080] The default for Betaflight, I believe, is 5.5%.
[00:10:07.080 → 00:10:09.100] You sometimes can go a little bit lower.
[00:10:09.440 → 00:10:10.480] Why would you want to go lower?
[00:10:10.480 → 00:10:14.420] Because the lower the idle value, like if you're inverted,
[00:10:14.680 → 00:10:18.040] and you have a high idle value, it will pull you down toward the ground.
[00:10:18.400 → 00:10:23.620] Whereas if you have a lower idle value, you can hang inverted for longer.
[00:10:24.040 → 00:10:27.020] A lower idle value also lets you drop faster.
[00:10:27.140 → 00:10:29.860] When you drop throttle, if you have a high idle value,
[00:10:30.040 → 00:10:32.200] you will float more and drop slower.
[00:10:32.440 → 00:10:34.900] Whereas with a lower idle value, you will drop faster.
[00:10:34.900 → 00:10:40.100] A higher idle value gives you better prop wash handling during turns.
[00:10:41.340 → 00:10:45.320] And the reason for that is that motors have more torque at higher throttle.
[00:10:45.740 → 00:10:49.340] So if you drop the throttle all the way down as low as it can possibly go,
[00:10:49.580 → 00:10:50.860] the motor won't have a lot of torque,
[00:10:50.960 → 00:10:56.640] and it will have a harder time dealing with difficult handling conditions like sharp turns.
[00:10:56.640 → 00:11:00.580] So some racers will actually turn this idle value up to 7 or 8%.
[00:11:00.580 → 00:11:04.560] Many freestyle pilots try and get it down as low as 2 or 3%
[00:11:04.560 → 00:11:07.440] so they get that nice hang time and clean drops.
[00:11:07.440 → 00:11:17.020] I don't recommend that you use this because Betaflight 4.3 has a setting called dynamic idle value.
[00:11:17.740 → 00:11:22.500] And if you use dynamic idle, it overrides the static idle value and works better.
[00:11:22.860 → 00:11:25.340] And we'll talk more about that when we get to the PID tuning tab.
[00:11:25.900 → 00:11:29.260] But that's what the idle percent is.
[00:11:29.520 → 00:11:35.720] The 3D option allows you to reverse the motors while you are in flight,
[00:11:35.720 → 00:11:38.600] allowing the quadcopter to fly upside down.
[00:11:38.720 → 00:11:41.420] And that's going to sound a little confusing if you've never heard of it.
[00:11:41.500 → 00:11:45.800] Basically what happens is that center throttle means that the motors are idled.
[00:11:46.080 → 00:11:49.540] And then if you raise the throttle, the quadcopter flies up.
[00:11:49.620 → 00:11:52.860] And if you lower the throttle below 50%, it pushes down.
[00:11:53.060 → 00:11:57.520] So you can literally flip the quad over and hover upside down or fly around upside down
[00:11:57.520 → 00:11:59.960] and lets you do all kinds of crazy acro stuff.
[00:12:00.180 → 00:12:04.640] If you enable this option, you have to also change the motor direction
[00:12:04.640 → 00:12:06.920] in BLHeli in the ESC.
[00:12:07.000 → 00:12:09.840] You can't just enable this option and leave your ESCs alone.
[00:12:09.920 → 00:12:10.420] It won't work.
[00:12:10.780 → 00:12:14.740] I have a video about setting up 3D and I'll link it down in the video description.
[00:12:14.980 → 00:12:17.480] I did it on a little tiny whoop so I didn't have much to lose.
[00:12:17.860 → 00:12:18.860] And it was pretty fun.
[00:12:19.420 → 00:12:20.800] Most people don't do this though.
[00:12:21.540 → 00:12:23.180] So if you've never heard of this, that's probably why.
[00:12:23.300 → 00:12:26.440] Now that we've set these options up, the motors are capable of spinning.
[00:12:26.440 → 00:12:31.160] But they won't spin until we change one of the other options on the page.
[00:12:31.160 → 00:12:34.360] Before I tell you what that is, could I ask you to go down and hit the like button?
[00:12:35.160 → 00:12:35.860] I'm sure it means a lot.
[00:12:36.000 → 00:12:36.320] Thank you.
[00:12:36.980 → 00:12:37.180] Okay.
[00:12:37.900 → 00:12:39.180] I understand the risks.
[00:12:39.480 → 00:12:41.200] The propellers are removed.
[00:12:41.900 → 00:12:43.400] Do you understand the risks?
[00:12:43.760 → 00:12:51.020] If we go and look over in the setup tab, we can see the MSP arming status flag.
[00:12:51.120 → 00:12:55.580] The MSP flag is telling us that stands for multi-way serial protocol.
[00:12:55.780 → 00:12:59.680] And it means that we are talking to the configurator and we cannot arm the quad.
[00:12:59.680 → 00:13:06.620] If we go to the motors tab and we enable this option, then when we go back to the setup tab,
[00:13:06.660 → 00:13:09.400] you will see that the MSP flag is gone.
[00:13:09.740 → 00:13:12.120] And now we can spin the motors.
[00:13:13.020 → 00:13:16.740] So your props better be off or you could get in trouble.
[00:13:16.940 → 00:13:22.200] Now, when I enable that option, these sliders are going to become enabled.
[00:13:22.200 → 00:13:24.540] But currently the sliders don't do anything.
[00:13:24.960 → 00:13:26.880] Those sliders are used to spin the motors.
[00:13:26.980 → 00:13:28.480] We have four motors, one, two, three, four.
[00:13:28.480 → 00:13:31.840] We can see where those motors are by looking at the mixer diagram.
[00:13:32.320 → 00:13:38.640] And we can raise these sliders and it shows the output value that the motor would be receiving.
[00:13:38.900 → 00:13:41.900] But it's not spinning because we don't have a battery plugged in.
[00:13:41.980 → 00:13:43.460] You can't spin the motors off of USB.
[00:13:43.620 → 00:13:45.040] You've got to plug a battery in.
[00:13:45.260 → 00:13:46.160] So let's do that.
[00:13:46.380 → 00:13:50.460] And now you can see that if I raise those sliders, the motors will begin to spin.
[00:13:50.720 → 00:13:53.380] Let me show you some shortcuts here for working with these sliders.
[00:13:53.380 → 00:14:01.820] If I click on the slider and then use the up arrow, it'll raise slowly, like one at a time.
[00:14:02.160 → 00:14:08.760] If I press page up and page down, it'll go up and down in increments.
[00:14:09.120 → 00:14:13.460] And if I do home and end, it'll go all the way to full and all the way to zero.
[00:14:13.460 → 00:14:16.080] You'd think home would take it all the way to full.
[00:14:18.720 → 00:14:25.260] Well, it looks like end takes it to full and home takes it to zero, which I'm pretty sure is backwards from how it used to be.
[00:14:25.320 → 00:14:25.920] But there you go.
[00:14:26.760 → 00:14:28.060] Don't do what I just did.
[00:14:28.720 → 00:14:34.660] Taking the throttle from zero all the way instantaneously to 100% is not great.
[00:14:34.660 → 00:14:38.960] I mean, it shouldn't hurt anything, but it's not great.
[00:14:39.260 → 00:14:40.300] And it's not a good...
[00:14:40.300 → 00:14:41.780] Don't do that if you can point it.
[00:14:41.980 → 00:14:43.000] Use page up and page down.
[00:14:43.720 → 00:14:49.260] So each of these sliders controls the individual motors, and then the master slider spins all four motors.
[00:14:49.600 → 00:14:53.900] As we're doing that, we can also see an error percent here.
[00:14:54.240 → 00:14:57.880] Now, that error percent only is visible if you're using bidirectional D-shot,
[00:14:57.880 → 00:15:03.280] because if you're not using bidirectional D-shot, the flight controller sends commands to the ESC,
[00:15:03.280 → 00:15:07.760] and then it has no idea if the ESC got them or if it didn't, just sends the commands and cross your fingers.
[00:15:08.220 → 00:15:11.240] So bidirectional D-shot is super useful for troubleshooting.
[00:15:11.580 → 00:15:15.760] As a rule of thumb, you want to see this error percent be less than 1%.
[00:15:15.760 → 00:15:17.840] Well, you want it to be 0%.
[00:15:17.840 → 00:15:19.740] It should almost always be 0%.
[00:15:19.740 → 00:15:28.700] But if it's slightly more than 0%, as long as it's less than 1%, you could fly and not consider yourself to have a serious problem.
[00:15:29.160 → 00:15:31.860] If any of these error percents are more than about 1%,
[00:15:31.860 → 00:15:36.280] something is wrong with your hardware, your signal wire, something is messed up, you should not fly the quad.
[00:15:36.760 → 00:15:42.440] And notice that it's 0% here, but, like, it might, if I had a problem with electrical noise,
[00:15:42.860 → 00:15:47.120] start having an issue when I start, like, arm the quad or something.
[00:15:48.080 → 00:15:50.540] But am I staying at 0% as you would hope.
[00:15:50.540 → 00:15:54.340] The other thing that we're seeing is the RPM of the motors.
[00:15:54.580 → 00:15:56.100] And that's what this R is here.
[00:15:56.780 → 00:16:02.900] And you can see that RPM is moving slightly as the motors have small differences in their speed.
[00:16:02.900 → 00:16:08.920] You might also be surprised that the motors aren't spinning at exactly the same RPM,
[00:16:09.280 → 00:16:12.200] given that they're getting the exact same throttle signal.
[00:16:12.580 → 00:16:16.400] And the reason for that is that there's small manufacturing variances in the motors.
[00:16:16.760 → 00:16:23.700] They are not exactly the same KV, and therefore sending them the same throttle signal produces small variances in RPM.
[00:16:23.700 → 00:16:32.340] In my experience, a difference in RPM of maybe 1 to 200 RPM is normal for, like, motors in this class.
[00:16:32.500 → 00:16:35.120] More than that could be an indication of a problem.
[00:16:35.220 → 00:16:40.820] In other words, if we raise the master slider, and we see that some of these motors are spinning at about 3,500 RPM,
[00:16:41.000 → 00:16:47.120] but then one of them is spinning at, like, 3,000 or 2,800 RPM, that motor might be screwed up.
[00:16:47.120 → 00:16:52.620] Now, I want to go back to this error percent, because I want you to see that if I unplug the battery,
[00:16:54.640 → 00:16:57.280] the error percent is going to go to 100%.
[00:16:57.280 → 00:17:01.000] If you see your error percent at 100% and your ESC is powered up,
[00:17:01.100 → 00:17:05.340] what it probably means is that your ESC doesn't support bidirectional D-shot.
[00:17:05.460 → 00:17:09.040] It could be that the flight controller is unplugged or something in theory.
[00:17:09.040 → 00:17:14.940] But most often, that's going to be a BL-Heli S ESC, which needs Blue Jay flash to it,
[00:17:15.180 → 00:17:16.680] and that's why you would see that.
[00:17:16.680 → 00:17:21.160] Now, you may be a little bit surprised to see this gyro readout scale here,
[00:17:21.320 → 00:17:24.800] and that's just showing me, as if I move the quad or tap the table,
[00:17:24.900 → 00:17:28.840] we can see a readout of the vibration that the quad is experiencing.
[00:17:29.040 → 00:17:30.440] Why is that on the motors tab?
[00:17:30.860 → 00:17:35.240] Because a good way to test for a bad motor,
[00:17:35.600 → 00:17:36.940] I told you you could look at the RPM.
[00:17:37.360 → 00:17:41.020] Another thing you can do is you can look at the vibration that the motor creates.
[00:17:41.440 → 00:17:45.180] So if I enable the slider here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to reset,
[00:17:45.180 → 00:17:48.400] and I'm going to look at the XYZ values.
[00:17:48.800 → 00:17:51.780] And what I'm seeing here is the max value in parentheses
[00:17:51.780 → 00:17:53.940] and the current value here on the left.
[00:17:54.100 → 00:17:58.860] And you can see the max value is about 0.98 Gs for all three of them.
[00:17:59.060 → 00:18:02.900] And then the RMS, the root mean square, is sort of the average for all three axes,
[00:18:03.000 → 00:18:05.060] and that's 0.4 roughly.
[00:18:05.060 → 00:18:08.580] What I'm then going to do is I'm going to raise the slider
[00:18:08.580 → 00:18:14.960] and bring it back down again.
[00:18:15.080 → 00:18:17.900] And I'm going to look at the amount of vibration that that motor created.
[00:18:18.420 → 00:18:22.120] And in fact, I have one of these motors that's been dinged up really badly.
[00:18:22.280 → 00:18:23.800] Yes, that's the one.
[00:18:23.940 → 00:18:25.040] That's motor number one.
[00:18:25.560 → 00:18:28.300] And that motor is in okay shape.
[00:18:28.300 → 00:18:32.720] And that was about 3.4, 2.2, and 1.7 Gs.
[00:18:32.820 → 00:18:37.060] If we then look at this banged up motor, which is motor number three,
[00:18:37.240 → 00:18:38.360] we should see a difference.
[00:18:38.440 → 00:18:39.420] So let's reset that.
[00:18:43.380 → 00:18:43.860] Bingo.
[00:18:44.380 → 00:18:48.520] Do you see that we have 6.1 on the Z axis, 2.9 and 1.46?
[00:18:48.880 → 00:18:51.940] So we've got significantly more vibration from that motor,
[00:18:52.300 → 00:18:55.040] and it's got visible damage, so I'm not surprised to see that.
[00:18:55.400 → 00:18:57.420] That's what that gyro scale is for.
[00:18:57.420 → 00:19:01.560] Lastly, let's come down to the motor direction and the reorder motors wizards.
[00:19:01.660 → 00:19:05.180] These are new in Betaflight 4.3, and they are so, so helpful.
[00:19:05.540 → 00:19:07.400] We're going to start with reorder motors.
[00:19:07.640 → 00:19:11.120] And the reason we might do this would be if the flight controller
[00:19:11.120 → 00:19:15.260] was not mounted facing forward or the ESC was rotated.
[00:19:16.580 → 00:19:20.240] If I hit reorder motors, the first thing I need to do is acknowledge the risk
[00:19:20.240 → 00:19:23.600] and then start the motor remapping wizard.
[00:19:24.180 → 00:19:26.980] The flight controller is going to spin one of the motors,
[00:19:26.980 → 00:19:29.760] and I'm going to click on whichever motor is spinning.
[00:19:30.560 → 00:19:35.600] Now, in this case, it's all correct because this quadcopter has been set up correctly.
[00:19:35.960 → 00:19:38.920] But if you had a case where an ESC was mounted,
[00:19:39.220 → 00:19:43.280] not mounted facing the expected direction or something like that,
[00:19:43.440 → 00:19:46.640] then this reorder motors wizard would sort it all out for you.
[00:19:46.720 → 00:19:48.340] And when you're done, you just hit save.
[00:19:48.340 → 00:19:51.060] The motor direction wizard does the same thing,
[00:19:51.420 → 00:19:55.240] but it checks for the motor spinning the correct direction.
[00:19:55.760 → 00:19:56.920] And there's two ways to do this.
[00:19:57.000 → 00:20:00.620] One is with the wizard, which will reset all of the motor spin directions
[00:20:00.620 → 00:20:02.560] and let you pick which one to reverse,
[00:20:02.920 → 00:20:06.620] or individually where it leaves the setting as it is
[00:20:06.620 → 00:20:08.300] and you check each motor individually.
[00:20:08.300 → 00:20:12.300] The key thing is that if you have previously set a quad up and you run the wizard,
[00:20:12.580 → 00:20:16.380] it will wipe your previous motor directions and set them all back to normal.
[00:20:16.700 → 00:20:20.040] So I normally do individually, and I just pick one motor,
[00:20:20.720 → 00:20:22.420] and I look at the direction it's spinning.
[00:20:22.940 → 00:20:26.100] Or sometimes if I can't tell, I'll just put my finger against it
[00:20:26.100 → 00:20:29.800] and see which way it's dragging.
[00:20:30.020 → 00:20:31.580] Okay, so that's dragging that way.
[00:20:31.580 → 00:20:36.900] So this one is spinning counterclockwise, counterclockwise, and that is correct.
[00:20:37.240 → 00:20:40.260] If we need to reverse it, we can just hit reverse here,
[00:20:40.500 → 00:20:41.820] and it will change the direction.
[00:20:42.460 → 00:20:44.160] And we can do that for all four of the motors
[00:20:44.160 → 00:20:48.400] to make sure they match the direction that we see here in the diagram.
[00:20:48.660 → 00:20:53.040] By the way, that motor reverse setting is stored in the ESC.
[00:20:53.640 → 00:20:56.440] So if you swap a flight controller,
[00:20:56.860 → 00:21:00.080] you do not need to redo that setting.
[00:21:00.220 → 00:21:01.300] It will be preserved.
[00:21:01.300 → 00:21:03.680] The motor direction will be preserved in the ESC.
[00:21:03.840 → 00:21:06.800] But if you swap an ESC, you would need to rerun that wizard.
[00:21:07.160 → 00:21:10.920] So to sum up, the general way that I go through this tab is,
[00:21:11.240 → 00:21:12.340] number one, set the mixer.
[00:21:12.520 → 00:21:14.480] Obviously, it's usually going to be quad X.
[00:21:15.000 → 00:21:17.660] Decide whether you want props in or props out rotation.
[00:21:17.920 → 00:21:19.080] Set your motor protocol.
[00:21:19.420 → 00:21:21.820] Enable bidirectional D-shot if at all possible.
[00:21:22.080 → 00:21:23.460] Check your motor poles are correct.
[00:21:23.660 → 00:21:25.960] Leave the motor idle alone because we're going to set that
[00:21:25.960 → 00:21:27.340] when we get to the PID tuning tab.
[00:21:27.620 → 00:21:28.520] We're not going to mess with that.
[00:21:28.520 → 00:21:32.180] And then run the reorder motors wizard to check the motor order.
[00:21:32.480 → 00:21:35.340] And then run the motor direction wizard to check the motor direction.
[00:21:35.840 → 00:21:36.560] And you're good.
[00:21:36.700 → 00:21:39.940] Next up, I think it's time to go to the configuration tab.
[00:21:40.040 → 00:21:41.280] We've waited long enough.
[00:21:41.740 → 00:21:44.460] I'm going to put a card on screen with a link to that video,
[00:21:44.460 → 00:21:48.260] as well as a card on screen with a link to the whole playlist for this series.
[00:21:48.260 → 00:21:52.180] If you want to start from the beginning and learn about all this stuff.
[00:21:52.500 → 00:21:53.440] Thanks so much for watching.
[00:21:53.560 → 00:21:54.080] I'll see you there.
