00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel all about electronics.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,600
So in this video and the subsequent videos, we will learn about the diode.

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,880
And these are the following topics that we will cover in the series of videos.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,760
And in this particular video, we will learn that what is diode and how the VI characteristic

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,980
of the diode will look like.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,440
And we will also see the equivalent circuit for this diode.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,120
And in the subsequent videos, we will learn about the device physics of this diode.

8
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,260
And we will also see the different applications of the diode.

9
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,620
So now the question is, what is diode?

10
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,720
Now we all know about the resistor.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,060
It is the most widely used type of passive circuit element.

12
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:53,000
And it allows the flow of current in both directions.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,360
Similarly, this diode is a two-terminal semiconductor device which allows the flow of current only

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,200
in one direction.

15
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,100
And if you see the symbol of the diode, then it looks like this.

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:09,540
So here, this arrow indicates the direction in which this diode allows the flow of current.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,500
Now the one terminal of this diode is known as the anode.

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,800
And the second terminal of the diode is known as the cathode.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,100
Now whether this diode will allow the flow of current or not, it depends upon the polarity

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,720
of the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode.

21
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,440
So, if the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode is positive, then in

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,600
general we can say that this diode will allow the flow of current in one direction.

23
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,300
While the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode is negative, then it will

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,480
not allow the flow of current.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,420
So now when this diode is connected in particular circuit, and if you want to analyze that circuit,

26
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,740
then the circuit can be analyzed by knowing the voltage and current that is flowing through

27
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,740
this diode.

28
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,020
And that can be found using the VI characteristic of the diode.

29
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,720
Now for the resistor, we know that it is a linear element and the relationship between

30
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,040
the voltage and current is linear.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:05,300
So using the Ohm's law, we can easily find the voltage and current through this resistor.

32
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,240
But unlike the case of resistor, the diode is a nonlinear element.

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,780
So the relationship between the voltage and current for the diode is nonlinear.

34
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,700
And moreover that, this diode allows the flow of current only in one direction.

35
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,220
And it almost blocks the current in the reverse direction.

36
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,220
Now if you look this graph, then it looks like the graph is symmetrical in both directions.

37
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,880
But don't get confused by the symmetricity.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,980
Because here in this graph, both the positive and the negative axis have a different scale.

39
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,760
For example, on the positive y-axis, we have a scale in mA, while on the negative y-axis,

40
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,980
we have a scale in µA.

41
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,680
Similarly on the positive x-axis, if you see, the voltage varies like 0.5V, 1V, and 1.5V.

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,360
While if you observe on the negative x-axis, the voltage scale varies like –10V, 20V,

43
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,360
and –30V.

44
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,160
So because of the different scale, this characteristic looks symmetrical on both axes.

45
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,240
But if we keep the same scale on both axes, then the diode characteristic will look like

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
this.

47
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,320
So as you can see, in the reverse direction, the current that is flowing through the diode

48
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,680
is almost negligible.

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,040
So, using this VI characteristic of the diode, we can easily find the voltage and current

50
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,860
that is flowing through the diode.

51
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,880
And using this, we can easily analyze any circuit which contains these diodes.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,020
But because of the nonlinear characteristic of this diode curve, it is a bit difficult

53
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,360
to find the voltage and current very easily.

54
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,620
So, what we can do, we can approximate this diode characteristic and using this, we can analyze

55
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,680
the circuits.

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,500
So, first of all, what we will do, we will consider this diode as an ideal diode.

57
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,960
And for this ideal diode, we will see the VI characteristic.

58
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,500
And also we will see the equivalent circuit for this ideal diode.

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,540
And step by step, we will introduce few more parameters to this ideal diode.

60
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,900
And using this, we will approximate the diode characteristic curve.

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
So for the ideal diode, whenever the voltage that is applied between the anode and cathode

62
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,980
is positive, then simply it will act as a closed switch.

63
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,420
On the other hand, if the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode is negative,

64
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,600
in that case, simply it will act as an open switch.

65
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,780
So now let's see the VI characteristic for this ideal diode.

66
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,900
So, in the case 1, when the applied voltage is positive, on the VI characteristic, we will

67
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,020
get the vertical line.

68
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,520
And for the case 2, when the applied voltage is negative, then for that case, we will get

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,180
the horizontal line on the negative x direction.

70
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,960
So this is the VI characteristic for the ideal diode.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,740
So now whenever the positive voltage is applied to this diode, then it can be said that the

72
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,280
diode has been forward biased.

73
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,280
And it will allow the flow of current.

74
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,900
While on the other hand, whenever the negative voltage is applied to this diode, then it will

75
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,640
not allow the flow of current.

76
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,500
And simply we can say that it has been reverse biased.

77
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,760
So we will talk more about this forward and reverse bias at the later part of the video.

78
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,680
So now let's take one simple example in which the diode is connected in series with the voltage

79
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
source and the resistor.

80
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,980
Now here we are assuming that the diode is an ideal diode.

81
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,000
It means that whenever the voltage that is appearing across the anode and cathode of

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,600
the diode is positive, then simply it can be represented by the closed switch.

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,640
And as you can see over here, the applied voltage across the diode is 10V.

84
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,200
So, simply it can be represented by the closed switch.

85
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
And the current that is flowing through this 100Ω resistor will be equal to 10V divided

86
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
by 100Ω.

87
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,040
That is equal to 0.1A.

88
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,760
While on the other hand, if we apply the minus 10V in this circuit, then the applied voltage

89
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,460
across the diode will be minus 10V.

90
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,200
And it will not allow any flow of current.

91
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,600
So, simply it will act as an open switch.

92
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,380
And the current that is flowing through the circuit will be equal to 0A.

93
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,540
Now some of you might have a question that how to find the voltage across this diode.

94
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:57,020
So, that can be found by finding the Thevenin's equivalent voltage between these two terminals.

95
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,780
So, simply you need to remove this diode from the circuit and you need to find the Thevenin's

96
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,420
equivalent voltage between these two terminals.

97
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,660
So, if you remove this diode, then the Thevenin's equivalent voltage which appears between this

98
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,540
anode and the cathode in this particular case will be equal to minus 10V.

99
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,720
And because of that, the diode will be non-conducting.

100
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,840
On the other hand, whenever the 10V is appearing between these two terminals, then the diode simply

101
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,040
will act as a closed switch.

102
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,900
Now, if you see the VI characteristic of this ideal diode, then you can observe that even

103
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,480
if we apply very small positive voltage between this anode and cathode, then also this diode

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,720
will start conducting.

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,880
So, let's say even if we apply the positive 0.1V between this anode and cathode, then also

106
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,720
this ideal diode should start conducting.

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,700
But if you see the actual diode, it will start conducting only after the applied voltage cross

108
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
some threshold voltage.

109
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,220
And if you see the VI characteristic, then it will look like this.

110
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,960
So, up to certain threshold voltage, the diode will not allow any flow of current.

111
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,440
And whenever the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage, then only the diode will

112
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,960
allow the flow of current.

113
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,560
So, this voltage is known as the threshold voltage or the cutting voltage for the diode.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,400
Now, like I said before, this diode is a semiconductor device.

115
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,920
And usually it is made up of either silicon or germanium.

116
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,280
So, for silicon, this threshold voltage used to be in the range of 0.6 to 0.7V.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,700
While for germanium, usually it is around 0.3V.

118
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:28,400
So, actually the diode will start conducting once the applied voltage crosses this threshold

119
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
voltage.

120
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,860
And before that, it will not allow any flow of current.

121
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:36,140
So, this is the first approximation for the diode curve.

122
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,400
So, here in this approximation, we are considering this diode as an ideal diode.

123
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,260
But it will only allow the flow of current once the applied voltage crosses this threshold

124
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
voltage.

125
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,080
And the equivalent circuit will look like this.

126
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:54,080
So, in case of reverse bias, it will simply act as an open switch.

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,780
But whenever the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage, then only it will allow the

128
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,900
flow of current.

129
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,540
So, now let's take the same example that we have taken earlier.

130
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,140
So, in this approximation, we are considering this diode as an ideal diode except the fact

131
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,180
that it will allow the flow of current only after the applied voltage crosses the threshold

132
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,240
voltage.

133
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,080
And here we are assuming that the diode that is used is the silicon diode.

134
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,840
So, it has a threshold voltage of 0.7V.

135
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,760
So, once the applied voltage crosses this 0.7V barrier, then only it will allow the flow

136
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
of current.

137
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,280
Now, here as the applied voltage is 10V, so simply this diode will allow the flow of current.

138
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,540
And the equivalent circuit will look like this.

139
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:46,640
So, now if you find the current that is flowing through this 100Ω resistor, it will be equal

140
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,600
to 10V minus 0.7V divided by 100Ω.

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,400
That is equal to 0.093A.

142
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:59,600
While on the earlier case, when we have considered this diode as an ideal diode, at that time,

143
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,440
we found the value of this current as 0.1A.

144
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,360
So, using this approximation, we can find the more accurate values of voltage and current

145
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
in the circuit.

146
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,360
Now in the same approximation, suppose if we apply the minus 10V, then in that case, the

147
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,200
current will simply act as an open switch.

148
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,320
And it will not allow any flow of current.

149
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,600
So, the current that is flowing through this resistor will be equal to 0A.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,680
Now, in this first approximation also, we have considered that the diode has a 0 resistance.

151
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,480
And that can be also visible from the VI characteristic of this diode.

152
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,340
Because if you observe over here, once the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage,

153
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,780
then the voltage that appears across the diode will remain constant.

154
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
And only current will increase.

155
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,880
It means that the diode offers the 0 resistance.

156
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,860
But in actual case, every device has some finite resistance, which will limit the current

157
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,900
that is flowing through that particular device.

158
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,760
So, now let's consider the second approximation, where we are also considering that the diode has

159
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,660
some finite resistance.

160
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,780
And in that case, if you see the VI characteristic, then it will look like this.

161
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:14,360
So, up to the threshold voltage, the diode will offer infinite resistance or simply it will

162
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,300
act as an open switch.

163
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,620
And then after, it will provide some finite resistance.

164
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,100
And that resistance can be found from the slope of this curve.

165
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,900
So, this resistance is also known as the bulk resistance or the body resistance.

166
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,660
So, this resistance is the resistance that is offered by the semiconductor device out of

167
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,100
which this diode has been made.

168
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,540
So, now let's see the equivalent circuit for this second approximation.

169
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,940
So, whenever the diode is reversed biased, in that case simply it will offer the infinite

170
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,480
resistance or we can say that it will act as an open switch.

171
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,800
But whenever the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage, in that case, now it will

172
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,440
offer some finite resistance of Rb.

173
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,540
That is the bulk resistance of this diode.

174
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,980
So, this is the equivalent circuit in case of the second approximation.

175
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,100
Now, apart from this bulk resistance, diode has one more resistance.

176
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,720
And this resistance is present in the diode because of its internal structure.

177
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,980
So, we will talk more about this diode resistance in the separate video.

178
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,700
Now, typically the value of this resistance used to be a few ohms.

179
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,440
So, in the circuit, if the Thevenin's equivalent resistance which appears across the diode is much

180
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,880
more than the diode resistance, in that case, the diode resistance can be neglected.

181
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,280
But if the Thevenin's equivalent resistance which appears across the diode is comparable

182
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,000
to the diode resistance, in that case, we also need to consider this diode resistance.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,440
So, for example, in this case, let us assume that the diode has a resistance of 25 ohms.

184
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,000
Now, this resistor is comparable to this 100 ohm resistor.

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
So, we need to consider this diode resistance.

186
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,440
So, if we consider this diode resistance, then the current that is flowing through this 100

187
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,880
ohm resistor will be equal to 10V-0.7V divided by 125 ohm.

188
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:13,440
And if you see the current, it will be equal to 0.074 ampere.

189
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,480
So, because of this diode resistance, if you see, now the actual current that is flowing

190
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,240
through this 100 ohm resistor will change.

191
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,440
So, using this second approximation, we can find the more accurate value of the current and

192
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,840
voltage that is flowing through the circuit.

193
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,320
But in most of the circuits, the Thevenin's equivalent resistance which appears across the

194
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,200
diode used to be much larger than this diode resistance.

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,440
And simply we can neglect this diode resistance.

196
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,320
So, in this second approximation of this diode, we have assumed that the diode is non-conducting

197
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,200
till the point the applied voltage crosses the threshold voltage.

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,940
And then after it offers some finite resistance.

199
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,820
So, if you see this type of characteristic, then it is known as the piecewise linear characteristic.

200
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,260
Because what we have done, we have segmented the actual characteristic of this diode into

201
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,320
the piecewise linear characteristic.

202
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:13,000
So, up to the threshold voltage, we have assumed that the diode is non-conducting.

203
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,080
And after the threshold voltage, it will offer some finite resistance.

204
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,480
Okay, so now let's talk about the actual curve of this diode.

205
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,280
So, in this diode curve, like I said before, this region is known as the forward region.

206
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,660
Because once the applied voltage crosses the threshold voltage, then the diode starts conducting.

207
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:37,400
And whenever the applied voltage is less than the threshold voltage, in that case, the current

208
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,340
that is flowing through the diode is almost negligible.

209
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,340
Now, whenever we apply the reverse voltage to this diode, then that region of operation

210
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:48,220
is known as the reverse region of operation.

211
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,340
And in this region, the current that is flowing through the diode used to be very small.

212
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,020
And this current is known as the reverse saturation current of the diode.

213
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:05,420
So, as you can see from the graph, even if we increase this reverse voltage across the diode,

214
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,880
then also the current will only increase by marginal amount.

215
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,540
But we cannot increase this reverse voltage indefinitely.

216
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,700
Because if we go beyond certain voltage, then the diode will come into the breakdown region.

217
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:22,940
So, this region of operation is known as the breakdown region.

218
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,720
And this region of operation should be avoided.

219
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,980
Now, some diodes are specifically made to pretend this particular breakdown region.

220
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,200
And this type of diodes are known as the Zener diode.

221
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,300
So we will talk more about this Zener diode in the separate video.

222
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:45,240
But for any normal signal diodes, this region of operation should be avoided.

223
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,460
So if you see the datasheet, you will find that the maximum breakdown voltage for the diode

224
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,080
has been mentioned.

225
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,680
So the applied reverse voltage should be less than this breakdown voltage.

226
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,960
Now in the forward region of this diode characteristic curve, if you observe, as the voltage across

227
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:07,760
the diode increases, the current that is flowing through the diode will increase exponentially.

228
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:13,200
So in datasheets, you will also find one more parameter that is known as the maximum allowable

229
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,640
forward current.

230
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,300
So diode current should be less than this maximum allowable forward current.

231
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,440
So here are the few parameters that we will find in the datasheet of any diode.

232
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,540
So now in the next video, we will talk more about the diode resistance.

233
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:34,240
So I hope in this video you understood what is diode and the Vi characteristic of the diode.

234
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,680
So if you have any question or suggestion, do let me know in the comment section below.
