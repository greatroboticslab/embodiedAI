[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:03.300] Hi, I want to make a full bridge rectifier.
[00:00:03.720 → 00:00:07.780] That's right, it's not a dumb single diode rectifier, it's a full bridge.
[00:00:07.940 → 00:00:08.860] What is a rectifier?
[00:00:09.160 → 00:00:12.980] It basically converts AC alternating current into DC direct current.
[00:00:13.240 → 00:00:15.940] Full bridge is basically made of four diodes in this arrangement.
[00:00:16.700 → 00:00:19.240] The rectification can also be done with a single diode.
[00:00:19.480 → 00:00:20.060] What's a diode?
[00:00:20.340 → 00:00:25.560] It's like an electrical check valve that allows current in one direction but blocks it from going back.
[00:00:25.560 → 00:00:30.200] If you provide an AC voltage to a single diode, it outputs the positive half of the wave.
[00:00:30.300 → 00:00:35.580] If you put a capacitor at its output, it holds the voltage close to the peak of the wave as DC.
[00:00:35.900 → 00:00:41.780] Now a full bridge rectifier converts both the positive and negative peaks into positive bumps at the output.
[00:00:42.020 → 00:00:44.960] Adding a capacitor at the output converts it into DC again.
[00:00:45.180 → 00:00:50.900] Generally, a single diode is used for low power rectification as well as DC reverse polarity protection.
[00:00:50.900 → 00:00:57.200] But a full bridge rectifier is used for high power rectification as well as reverse polarity protection.
[00:00:57.500 → 00:00:58.620] Now here's my design.
[00:00:58.760 → 00:01:05.000] When connected to 120 volt AC line, it is designed to output close to 170 volt DC at no load.
[00:01:05.180 → 00:01:07.500] And capable of driving 10 amp maximum load.
[00:01:07.980 → 00:01:11.100] So naturally, there is a 10 amp fuse at the input for protection.
[00:01:11.380 → 00:01:12.400] Then the diode bridge.
[00:01:12.640 → 00:01:15.000] The added inductor helps with ripple filtering.
[00:01:15.320 → 00:01:16.220] Here's what I've made.
[00:01:16.220 → 00:01:19.560] It is pretty huge, which of course can output over a thousand watts.
[00:01:19.720 → 00:01:23.180] Unlike your puny wall adapter that can do 20 watts at best.
[00:01:23.520 → 00:01:24.460] Now let's plug it in.
[00:01:24.560 → 00:01:28.040] I have some loose wires connected to my circuit, which I will stick into the power plug.
[00:01:34.760 → 00:01:37.540] As you can clearly see, I have no regards for safety.
[00:01:37.740 → 00:01:38.580] Don't be like that.
[00:01:38.800 → 00:01:41.140] See, this electricity is not going to jump at you.
[00:01:41.240 → 00:01:43.100] Because it doesn't have high enough voltage to jump.
[00:01:43.100 → 00:01:45.840] The only way you would get hurt is by touching live wire.
[00:01:46.100 → 00:01:51.200] So insulate your circuit properly, wear safety gloves, and don't touch s*** with your bare hands.
[00:01:52.100 → 00:01:52.620] Bare hands.
[00:01:52.720 → 00:01:53.200] Baaah!
[00:01:53.320 → 00:01:54.520] Why do you call them bare hands?
[00:01:55.040 → 00:01:57.560] I'm going to touch 170 volt DC with my bare hands.
[00:01:57.860 → 00:01:59.700] There is 166 volt on the output.
[00:01:59.900 → 00:02:01.780] Now I'll put my finger across the output.
[00:02:03.080 → 00:02:04.600] See, I can barely feel it.
[00:02:04.760 → 00:02:06.680] DC is much less dangerous than AC.
[00:02:07.580 → 00:02:08.020] Barely.
[00:02:08.320 → 00:02:09.860] What's up with bears in your language?
[00:02:10.180 → 00:02:11.980] I feel so barely today.
[00:02:11.980 → 00:02:12.980] Barely.
[00:02:12.980 → 00:02:16.320] Bridge rectifiers are widely used in AC to DC converters.
[00:02:16.520 → 00:02:19.840] As far as I know, all your wall adapters contain one of these circuits.
[00:02:20.140 → 00:02:21.800] Now I will measure some waveforms.
[00:02:21.920 → 00:02:27.860] I connected the probe to my output lines, connected my circuit to this power bar, and now I will turn the power bar on.
[00:02:27.980 → 00:02:28.480] S***!
[00:02:28.980 → 00:02:29.480] S***!
[00:02:30.980 → 00:02:32.480] My fuse just blew up.
[00:02:32.480 → 00:02:39.480] Something I realized the hard way is that the ground of the probe is actually shorted to the earth of the power plug through the scope.
[00:02:39.480 → 00:02:43.700] So what happens is that when I connect the ground to the negative output of the bridge,
[00:02:44.240 → 00:02:48.540] it shorts the live wire to earth every negative cycle of the AC.
[00:02:48.540 → 00:02:51.700] And that's why we have fuses to avoid exciting fires.
[00:02:51.700 → 00:02:56.700] Now I'm using this tape called Kapton tape to insulate the earth of the power cord.
[00:02:57.700 → 00:03:01.900] I have the same setup again, and with the probe connected, I turn the power bar on.
[00:03:02.700 → 00:03:03.760] We are safe now.
[00:03:03.760 → 00:03:07.560] As you can see on the scope, the output voltage is around 170 volts.
[00:03:07.560 → 00:03:12.620] Now I like to use my 100 ohm resistor and connect it to the output to see how the waveform changes.
[00:03:14.920 → 00:03:15.560] S***!
[00:03:15.560 → 00:03:16.060] S***!
[00:03:16.060 → 00:03:16.560] S***!
[00:03:16.560 → 00:03:17.060] S***!
[00:03:17.060 → 00:03:17.560] S***!
[00:03:17.560 → 00:03:18.060] S***!
[00:03:18.060 → 00:03:23.300] A quick calculation shows having 170 volts across 100 ohm generates 300 watts of power.
[00:03:23.580 → 00:03:26.120] It's like having a 300 watt lamp within your fingers.
[00:03:26.360 → 00:03:28.040] It burns your skin very quickly.
[00:03:28.280 → 00:03:30.340] Now I use pliers to hold the resistor.
[00:03:30.340 → 00:03:30.840] S***!
[00:03:32.040 → 00:03:37.040] See the output voltage drops, but with very small ripples because there is a lot of filtering.
[00:03:37.940 → 00:03:39.540] Wow, I was holding that.
[00:03:39.540 → 00:03:41.840] I let it cool down for a while and s***!
[00:03:41.840 → 00:03:49.340] The ceramic core takes a long time to cool down, and now you can see that the resistor is made of resistive wires wound around the ceramic core.
[00:03:50.540 → 00:03:55.040] Anywho, this power supply will eventually feed my high-powered Tesla coil driver circuit.
[00:03:55.040 → 00:03:55.540] S***!
[00:03:55.540 → 00:03:56.040] S***!
[00:03:56.540 → 00:03:57.040] Oh!
[00:03:57.140 → 00:04:04.180] Remember in such circuits although unplugged the capacitors hold charge for a long period of time so always discharge them with some resistor.
[00:04:10.280 → 00:04:12.280] eh?!
[00:04:12.420 → 00:04:12.900] eh?!
[00:04:12.900 → 00:04:13.360] eh?!
[00:04:13.360 → 00:04:13.500] eh?!
[00:04:13.500 → 00:04:14.500] eh?!
[00:04:14.500 → 00:04:14.980] Thuh!
