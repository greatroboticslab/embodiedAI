If anyone can help me with what type of textbook for novices I can look into, i would be most obliged

I knew this channel was too early to be just misinfo and ads. Love the content!

well well well

ty for the video

This is on my list of top 10 dubbed animes.

I have a degree…! 🥜

Don't forget to use mask and ventilate your eletronic rooms and take humidity out! Cause menny haevy metal can end up absorbed by skin, eyes, respiration and end up in your kidneys! :text-green-game-over:

Thanks alot sir,but sir which text book can you suggest for a beginner sir

👍

i need to get an arduino. i have a raspberry pi as well.

Nice 👍

thanks asiandude

very beautifull explaination

I see great electronics channel, I subscribe.

How to start? To have natural interest and abilities and time :)

❤❤

this man is wrong, u dont need any knowledge for electronics

can i make a robots with electronics? or only electric circuit.

you know its good stuff when the guy is chinese

a component identifier is useful between an oscilloscope and a multimeter. it helps if you are sorting parts by tolerance.

What?

@brucewayne6561  u can model systems and pcbs with AI generative. also AI can give u solutions for circuits. u dont need to know anything by hard. even if u got a technical question it will answer

4:52 you meant voltage? Cuz measuring the current on a closed circuit with a multimeter in parallel is 💀

Did you, or a third party narrtor do the voice over? The only observation is, it's cathode, like the name Kathy.

Good job narrator. You are the greatest narrator!

at 4:52 you measure voltage and not current

Hard switch anti intrusion sequence made on motherboard able to help secure a device. Hard-line around the processor into a bypass for the processor to run anti intrusive software to keep a device secure. Or use for malware. @GoogleDeepMind   in software format @Norton You can use a targeting algorithm, like a targeted marketing algorithm, that corroborates facts to quantized images to find criminal evidence and locations of criminal activity. Like an image of a dagger for people who stabbed other people. @GoogleAI @GoogleDeepMind @NortonJapanan indexer setup you can use in combination with quantized images to find missing people, evidence of crimes, etc. You can draw up quantized images from off sequence outside the square. Needs data mining of quantized images, database, application to @Google Maps and index @Norton

and learned a lot👍👍👍👍

i really enjoyed the video

wonderful

Hello! Great tutorial, i didn't knew that you cant connect barell adapter directly...figured out you have AC in your house, and you need to convert it to DC...these sorts of little things i keep forgetting! Great job, i see you are passionate man! Keep it up <3

good video as im getting back into electronics these are some nice tools, thanks man.

Hi, knowing electronics, where can you work?, what can you do?

Thanks for sharing I am new in electronic, this video help me to understand what tools to buy.

wow exactly the video I needed, thank you for sharing you earned a sub

First, I need money.

Hi I prefer the Analog discovery 3 board => it has everything builtin and we can get started with our PC! We can also acquire all the data we needs in csv files => easily import it to any coding environment we work on!

Ski Desu ... I love this channel ... I will watch all the videos

Thanks for the information.

A high school level circuit course you say? Over here in the states we are to good for actually useful courses in high school.

Plise contaact for you am gean un  ethiopia

Cool review. Please say about your first projects. And why did you decide to learn electronics?

Would you recommend a two-in-one handheld oscilloscope and multimeter?

4:55 i think its measuring voltage across not current

thank U

You speak beautifully

"Resistors"

Sorry I don't agree with you, first what you need is a soldering iron, you first try to copy, then you next to try to understand, third then you try to analyze, fourth you try to design.  There are a lot of maker's lab that you can access today and as beginner you don't need anything.  Just go to a maker's lab, they have all the equipment.  Grow your  skills before buying any equipment.

Very good honest introduction to electronics equipment for beginners, thank you :)

This is good to watch. I got all the setup, just need a little of motivation again. I love my Rigol oscilloscope and function generator - both can interface to my computer. I also have several test tools for drone type stuff: servo and motor testers. It is a delight! An interface to your computer that can read your Futaba transmitter is also very handy. And Flipper Zero for the field is nice. Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Arduino is good for low-level electronics control, Raspberry Pi more for a camera system.

NARRATOR:  you might be the FIRST hired YouTube narrator that properly reflects the creators intent.      Almost every other YouTube narration is monotone garbage filled with mispronunciation.     GOOD JOB. 👍

Ye toh itna kharcha karayega

I learned a lot from this. Thank you so much!

my heartbeat came back to normal after he said a dso is not necessary

I'm becoming an Electrician, hopefully I might use this in the field.

This is great! Please keep making more videos.

I know it's a bit late to comment, but the stuff about multi-wire and single-wire jumpers will probably not be clear to people who don't already know something about electronics, or who don't realize that you're just talking about what's more commonly called stranded vs solid wire.  But it's a good tip--obviously solid wire failure is easier to spot.

Wrong. What you need is a goal.

I see this gay as a good profesore in elektronik in future,bravo!

Another Tipp for Beginners: Get yourself an nice environment. That makes hard times with PCBs much easier

This video was so informative for the beginners like me. Thank you for the great content..

I like your video good for me as beginner, how about the LCR meeter to measure the winding coil inductance (L) ? Let me know from your experience. Is it useful ?

Great talk for electronics introduction 😊

Thanks  ligghf..........................................................

I like to know enough to figure out the reason there's a bad channel in vintage stereo gear and then fix it.

Why would i need an Arduino to start electronics?

good video keep going

Very informative! Thank you! I'm going to save many of these equipment in Amazon and purchase when ready.

@16:45 About Tektronix osciloscope.Did you mean 20 to 30 million yen?

Будь или не будь, да, сделай уже хоть что-нибудь

Bro i love the efforts, the way you are explaining with pros and cons ..❤❤

Thank you for taking the time to make this video. Much appreciated. 👍

have any introduction to heat gun ?

ADALAM2000 is really awesome. If you have a computer you can get a function generator, oscilloscope, power supply, and more all in one small package less than 40,000 yen.

Thank you very much. ❤❤❤ THANKS GOD AND THE VIRGIN MARY AND SAINT JOSEPH. ❤❤❤❤❤ Happy thanksgiving to DENKI OTAkU and your family and Everyone. ❤ 25.11.2023 ❤ 8h02 ❤ 14.12.2023

Very helpful

Hello man. ¿Is it possible you could recommend me a equipment to make time-domain reflectometry? One cheap setup that could be use to make the technique, please.

Seu vídeo é excelente, muito obrigado pela sua dedicação ❤

Watching this, I think I forgot a lot of stuff I learned in college. If you don't use it, you lose it. I'm fucking depressed.

I only use softwares like protuies I don't have a way to buy them

I heard the Arduino isn't good for starters. I think it's better to learn how to read schematics and data sheets first

I'm new to this relatively, but I would like to further expand me knowledge and ability to work on and with electronics, and to make my own little electronics too.

Denki? That your name sir? 😂 sorry no offence. It's just I've never heard a name like this

Nice multimeter, good quality as it is Japan made. How much is the cheapest in Phil peso. Thsnk you. Well explained video.

Thanks for you to introduce the electronics for  the beginners, I like it very much Thanks alot

101 Comment, I Loved the whole video. Subed and liked, Thanks!

考公務員吧

Excellent starting video. I'm looking to get started as a hobby.

ياريال صدعت ياتتكلم يباني وتحط ترجمه ياتتدبلج الكلام بالانجليزي وتقصر عالفيديو الاصلي

wow

watching from California USA keep up the good work :)

Nice

Shouldn't we start by making our own oscilloscope?

I'm from yemen I love electronics but I don't have any equipment can you help me about it

Great..!, thanks for sharing.

Impressed by your presentation guiding a novice how 2 start understanding n doin electronics  Th equipments needed 4 doin electronics.....  Noted your channel name subscribed it n wil b following....

Another thing to note with breadboards or any circuit is if you want to know if any two connections are connected to each other, set your DMM in continuity mode and probe the metal contacts.  If the DMM makes a sound, it means they’re connected.

Buy an Arduino kit and a multimeter you are good to go

I watched a video while demonstrating how to put the components on the breadboard, I just want to know the product name of the adapter that you attached to the male plug adapter supply.thats all thank

Oh, you have very New parts 😊

Hi Denki means Electricity or Electric, Electronics, and Otaku means geek in Japanese.

@DENKI-OTAKU  cool

@DENKI-OTAKU  i didn't expect a Japanese to speak English! Cool!

not all meters do that.

If you want to learn Arduino coding check out paul mcwhorter he's an amazing teacher

Thx bro. just Kool. Either way we r great at techelctronics...

Thanks for translating your video in english.  unlike those who used an english title but talks in what the heck of an alien laguage they are talking to. 👍

You can def get into electronics knowing no calculations but it’s also very easy to learn and memorize the basics so don’t let it discourage you if you have to keep looking em up it gets easy fast

It feels like this video was dubbed...

Should I wear an anti-static wrist strap?

Do you really need Arduino? I’m not interested in coding, just the electronic circuits and components.

Please can I have your WeChat number, I want to learn how to repair  from you also produce. What should I do? I need your contact.

4:55 You mean measuring the voltage?

Thanks

Nice 👍

Hi I wanted to learn more about electronics how do I follow up with your service channels

nicely done. Retired and looking for more things to do with my time indoors. I've remained modestly interested in computers, micro-controllers, & electronics ever since my AAS electronics training decades ago. The Arduino products looks like my next most practical toy set. I've got most of the essential tools and might even see if my (decade old) collection of Basic Stamp controllers have life left in them. thanks for sharing (everyone), enjoy

「'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.」👏

Can you help with some tools ,im in Accra Ghana

You are just too good daddy, mentor and a teacher. I'm now trying to build . Can you help me out with some tools , I'm begging you. I'm in Africa ,Ghana Accra

Amazing

Electronica i vasta,ca hobby este accesibilă pentru cei ce renunță la multe altele financiar + ca familist nu ai timp sa te mai si dezvolti=sa tii pasul cu dezvoltarea exponențială in timp. Ca sa pornești pe acest drum trebuie sa ai si factori favorizanti.Investitiile nu se v or amortiza si uzura morală +defecțiunile chiar accidentale își pun amprenta 😢

Thank you very much😀😀😀

Thanks!

I want 5o learn eléctronucs to build speakers and amplifiers.

You have to be really passionate to do that. Knowing calculations helps a lot

Are the calculations something that I would learn in Physics 2 perhaps? Or would that generally be learned in electrical circuits course?

You can't get into electronic design without knowledge in calculations. All Engineering fields requires knowledge in Maths.

​ @benbo7042 except for social engineering 😉

@benbo7042 you never heard of a calculator?

@curly-hairedassassin5233 I am not in college yet but I believe that physics are general knowledge more than course specific subject. So, while there are electrical problems and calculations in there, you’ll likely have more circuits specific calculations with electrical courses. Remember that physics is a wider field than a school can teach you. So, they can’t really focus on every single details because the goal of the course is to help you with the accompanying course like electrical circuits.  In other words. Physics is a support course and electrical circuits is a major. Unless physics is your major then you’ll learn most of the stuff but you’re still incomparable to a degree with focus on electricity because they have the hands down with the practical aspects while physics majors focuses on the theoretical aspects.

​ @ItachiUchiha-gf4fz  The way that you explained that makes sense. Physics 2 will lay down the basic foundation of how electricity works, but the more in-depth experimentations will occur in Circuits & other ECE courses. Thank you so much!

Why do you think that?

​ @anthonysawyer3636 difficult to say

A true empath

It is

The "Bread-A-Boardo" gave it away to me. But I don't mind, as long as the content is good

If you want something had enough you'll find a way

@PDaddy0120  ca si stâlpul casei=bărbatul doar se forțează  pentru a se streseză si a se uzează prematur= mai repede,femeile sunt viclene doar te speculează ,asa ca nu te poți dedica hobby urilor daca esti familist+++

色々そろえたらお金かかりそうだけど、まずはお揃いのTシャツから購入しようと思いますｗｗ

I have a soldering iron a lead but I will soon have a multimeter

Thank you very much for your information to learning electronic.

❤

Well done, but how did you manage to make the translation

聞こえないよ、英語のせいで

Me too love electronic hobbies include technician at home but I don't have that much equipment stuff!.

それは最高でした。私はしばらくの間、初心者のためにそのような気の利いたビデオを探していました。 イランからの愛を込めて  That was awesome. I have been looking for such a nifty video for starters for a while. With love from IRAN

Nice!

Hello  I love your video I can I contact you?

Why still people use conventional current while current is follow of electrons through wire, the direct of electrons is from negative to positive.

4:37 , 4:50 , 10:37  when the translator is not paid enough or doesn't know the topic he's talking about

arduino is not necessary. Arduino is not electronic, is a joke

Good job 👍👈

This is a great video, are you working on more beginners electronics videos.

Thank you so much !! It is helpful both educational and informative. I love to learn electronics when I was a kid. However, in college I choose language programming/coding and graduated and earn a living. I took higher math as well using those scientific calculators as part of my curriculum. Everyday new gadgets release in the market facinated and curious the internal circuitry and functionality. The more my interest into practical electronics. I am facinated as well with robotics and AI,  how machine and coding works hand in hand. I believe it is more handy for me, to learn electronics since I have already knowledge in programming. I am bit in my 50's, and retired in programming and I love to learn electronics as a hobby, fixing electronic components in my free time would be a wonderful experience or perhaps create a simple circuit to automate some simple task. With your video, I think I have an idea what are the things I need for a start. I have gathered some of those in my years but have no time. Anyways, I am hoping it is not late  for me to learn new things especially in electronics in my age. Looking forward to more of your videos. Kudos !

Excellent video!

01:45 two wonderful examples of short circuit for both capacitors

Not for both, only for ceramic one

Programing an Arduino can be very daunting for a beginner, especially if you don't know much about coding.  I found this guy on youtube and he is very good at explaining how to program an Arduino.  He helped me a lot! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJWR7dBuc18&list=PLGs0VKk2DiYw-L-RibttcvK-WBZm8WLEP&index=1&t=738s

Good tutorial instruction and informative. Thanks for sharing

Whats The Point of Learning Electronics When All Your Corporations are Charades.

Awesome video❤, very good job🇧🇷😉👍subscribed👏👏👏👏👏 "@arduinomaquinas" thanks you !

Thank you sir

At around the 5 minute mark, the translator says "current" when he should have said "voltage" a few times. Great video!

Excelente 👌

I love his explanation.

This was useful .Thanks!

Hi Sir, can you please tell me does school or college tech me to learn about electronics? Or they just tech me to get high grade? PLEEEESSS answer me??!

Thanks enjoyed your video.  Maybe some confusion over measuring volts and amps. You should show that to measure amps,  the circuit must be broken somewhere and the ammeter inserted in series. Whereas voltage measurement is directly across the relevant component.

How do you dub your videos? Could you please explain?

Thanks

need osciloscope differantial probes and vi curve tracers and fault locators.

As a fellow electronics content creator, i'm impressed with your list of tools and equipments.  Great video too.

Oh!!! What a lovely cute turbomoter! It seems to be waving hands at me and say hi!

im getting into it, this gave me a lot of clarity that  i was looking for before! thank you very much!

I would love to learn more about electronics, but as I know me, I will be fully into it for a month or so, and then I will loose interst and abandon my newly obtained hobby.  I will probably get into it again after a while, but by that time I will have forgotten most of what I had already learned.  That's the struggle of having ADHD😔

Thank you. Respect.

Whether or not you can learn about electronics at school or college depends very much on what country you are in.

@cedriclynch  iraq, thank you sir, I'm gonna skip this bullshit and search for  Science myself and I have found tons of useful books 🤩

@Elias Yildiz I did take it for several years when I was a child, but right after I stopped taking it, I got into a bad drug habit, and I didn't ever take it since. The thing is, I now get morphine retard from a doc as substitution treatment for my opiate addiction, which also helps with the physical hyperactivity part, but there is still the mental ADD part left, unfortunately.  And I don't know If it would make sense to take Ritalin together with the morphine, but I will ask my doc what she thinks about that.

To cope with my adhd and my insatiable mind I learned rational-emotional regulation techniques. Because adhd is actually an executive dysfunction "disorder", learning how yours presents and building up such skills slowly is one of the most affective (imo) treatments for it. Meds do not work for me, ive tried nearly all of them on (and off) the market that I could get my hands on. They simply make some of my symptoms worse or make it impossible for me to cope with academic work entirely. Take it from someone who's been there done that. Anyone can learn executive functioning skills, we all have neuroplastic brains. Starting small and building up from there everyday on these types of skills is a life changer. But your mindset has to shift first, instead of looking at your adhd as a thing to medicate away, recognize that as neurodivergent people our brain structure evolved to meet a need that society no longer validates. In the ancient world we were the nocturnal guardians, the innovators, and the protectors of our hominid groups, knowing all of this and learning to work with my adhd instead of suppressing it and forcing myself to fit into societal standards of what success looks like has honestly opened my eyes to so much. You can be perfectly functioning and happy and healthy, but we will not get there through normal means, and certainly not through the means of pathologizing and medicalizing our inherent nature. We don't have a mental disorder that causes us harm, such as with schizophrenic patience or those with depression, we have a difference in brain structure that has to be accommodated. Please be kind to yourself and take this advice with a grain of salt, all adhd presents differently and what worked for me might not work for you, I just know that if I had this advice years early my life would look vastly different now and I wouldn't have beat myself up so much about things that are out of my control.

Yep, but it's like a whole new project every time. You just have to make sure all your projects are enjoyable. Yeah that's where I got stuck to.  Oh well! It's not like I won't being doing it again you know.:hand-green-crystal-ball:

Omg same!!!!!

Nice info, thanks for sharing it :)

Thanks for the nice information introducing new tech support appreciate you brother 👍🙏💐

At the 5 min mark your measuring the voltage not the current. I’m sure it was a mistake in the language interpretation.

Congrats ❤❤ and big thanks for all this

Thank you brother from Bangladesh ❤

Great

All I have is 2 soldering irons, a Klein 400 multimeter, and Yesterday I just found a hot pink TI-84 on the sidewalk.😂

Sweet. I recall being asked to fault  find some R&D   boards manufactured in china some years back. Typical R&D batch would be 10 manufactured on site, but the company chose to have them manufactured  in china and sent back to my country to progress. Not a single board worked when it came back,, I spent less than a minute to diagnose the fault and rectify it on the 2 boards , and had the other 8 boards working within the hour. Poor workmanship is the reason I tend not to purchase certain products,  this guy does not appear to be following anti stat procedures at all, , ,  would I purchase anything he made? No.  Likewise Dyson. They infer they are made in Britain   but are they? .

Satisfied ☑️

Great..!!!

amazing

Thank you from Morocco hhhhh

😂

Not the hot pink tho 😂😂😂😂

Gratz Bro 😊

You got this. Let’s fuckin’ goooooooooo

Luv my pink ti-84

Ain’t even got the soldering wire my boy might be able to just desolder 😭

I mean honestly that's pretty like ti-84s can be expensive 😂

And now you just need a fork and you’re all set

Dyson vacuum cleaners were once all made in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, UK. The company wanted to expand the factory to cater for increased demand but the local council refused permission on the ground that a large factory would be out of keeping with the rural character of the area. The authorities in some other countries were much more welcoming.

I believe that Numatic vacuum cleaners (of which the Henry is probably the most famous) are still made in the UK in Chard, Somerset.
