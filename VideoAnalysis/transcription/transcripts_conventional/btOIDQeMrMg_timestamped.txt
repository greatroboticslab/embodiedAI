[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:04.460] In our previous tutorials,
[00:00:04.460 → 00:00:06.560] we've discussed the basics of semiconductors,
[00:00:06.560 → 00:00:09.920] band gap, current carriers, and their classification.
[00:00:09.920 → 00:00:13.200] We learned that in order for a semiconductor material to be useful,
[00:00:13.200 → 00:00:15.520] it needs to be doped with an impurity atom.
[00:00:15.520 → 00:00:19.200] And it could be a pentavalent atom to produce an n-type material,
[00:00:19.200 → 00:00:23.120] or it could be a trivalent atom to come up with a p-type material.
[00:00:23.120 → 00:00:26.560] Now, if we take a small piece of semiconductor material and
[00:00:26.560 → 00:00:28.760] dope half of it with a trivalent atom,
[00:00:28.760 → 00:00:31.080] in the other half with a pentavalent atom,
[00:00:31.080 → 00:00:35.720] that would result in a semiconductor device with p-type and n-type portions,
[00:00:35.720 → 00:00:38.080] with a p-n junction where they meet.
[00:00:38.080 → 00:00:41.040] In this video, we are going to talk about this p-n junction,
[00:00:41.040 → 00:00:43.280] as it is the basis for diodes.
[00:00:43.280 → 00:00:46.920] After doping an intrinsic semiconductor material, usually silicon,
[00:00:46.920 → 00:00:49.960] so that part of it is p-type and the other part is n-type,
[00:00:49.960 → 00:00:54.320] a p-n junction is formed at the boundary between the p and n regions.
[00:00:54.320 → 00:00:56.840] In the p region, the majority carriers are wholes,
[00:00:56.840 → 00:01:00.160] while in the n region, the majority carriers are free electrons.
[00:01:00.160 → 00:01:05.800] When the p-n junction is formed, the free electrons in the n region begin to diffuse across the junction
[00:01:05.800 → 00:01:09.160] and combine with the holes in the p region near the junction.
[00:01:09.160 → 00:01:14.160] This makes the n region lose free electrons and creates a layer of positive charges near the junction.
[00:01:14.160 → 00:01:19.160] As the free electrons combine with the holes in the p region, the p region also loses holes,
[00:01:19.160 → 00:01:22.160] and creates a layer of negative charges near the junction.
[00:01:22.160 → 00:01:27.920] These two layers of positive and negative charges create a region where charge carriers are depleted.
[00:01:27.920 → 00:01:31.040] This region is called, fittingly, the depletion region.
[00:01:31.040 → 00:01:35.160] In reality, the depletion region is formed in an incredibly short amount of time,
[00:01:35.160 → 00:01:38.480] and its width is very thin compared to the p and n regions.
[00:01:38.480 → 00:01:46.480] The depletion region will continue to expand until the total negative charge in the depletion region repels any further diffusion of electrons into the p region.
[00:01:46.480 → 00:01:51.480] This time, the depletion region acts as a barrier to the movement of electrons across the junction.
[00:01:51.480 → 00:01:55.800] In the depletion region, there are many positive and negative charges on opposite sides,
[00:01:55.800 → 00:02:00.800] and as described by Coulomb's law, if there is a positive charge and a negative charge near each other,
[00:02:00.800 → 00:02:02.800] there is a force acting on these charges.
[00:02:02.800 → 00:02:07.800] The forces between the positive and negative charges in the depletion region create an electric field
[00:02:07.800 → 00:02:11.800] which blocks the free electrons from the n region to flow across the junction.
[00:02:11.800 → 00:02:14.800] In order for the electrons to move through this electric field,
[00:02:14.800 → 00:02:23.800] a certain amount of voltage equal to the barrier potential of the electric field must be applied across the p-n junction with the proper polarity.
[00:02:23.800 → 00:02:30.800] Now, let's try to analyze the formation of the p-n junction and the depletion region through an energy diagram.
[00:02:30.800 → 00:02:38.800] The energy levels of the valence and conduction bands in an n-type material are lower than the valence and conduction bands in a p-type material.
[00:02:38.800 → 00:02:43.800] This is because trivalent impurities exert lower forces on the outer shell electrons,
[00:02:43.800 → 00:02:48.800] and lower forces mean that the electron orbits are slightly larger and have greater energy.
[00:02:48.800 → 00:02:53.800] If we try to examine the energy diagram for a p-n junction at the instant of formation,
[00:02:53.800 → 00:03:01.800] we can see that the valence and conduction bands in the n region are at a noticeably lower energy level compared to the p-region valence and conduction bands.
[00:03:01.800 → 00:03:09.800] But, we can also see that the upper part of the conduction band in the n region and the lower part of the conduction band in the p region overlap.
[00:03:09.800 → 00:03:15.800] In this case, the free electrons in the upper part of the conduction in the region can easily diffuse across the p-n junction
[00:03:15.800 → 00:03:20.800] and temporarily become free electrons in the lower part of the p-region conduction band.
[00:03:20.800 → 00:03:28.800] Temporary because, after crossing the p-n junction, these free electrons rapidly lose energy and fall into the holes in the valence band of the p-region.
[00:03:28.800 → 00:03:37.800] As the free electrons from the upper part of the n-region conduction band cross the junction, the depletion region starts to form and expand.
[00:03:37.800 → 00:03:41.800] But, the energy level of the n-region conduction band also starts to decrease.
[00:03:41.800 → 00:03:48.800] This process will continue until there will be no electrons left in the n-region conduction band with enough energy to cross the junction.
[00:03:48.800 → 00:03:54.800] At that time, the junction is at equilibrium and the depletion region is complete because the diffusion is done.
[00:03:54.800 → 00:04:02.800] As you can see in the energy diagram, the top of the n-region conduction band and the bottom of the p-region conduction band is now aligned.
[00:04:02.800 → 00:04:09.800] And this time, there is now an energy hill that the electron from the n-region must climb in order to get to the p-region.
[00:04:09.800 → 00:04:15.800] Another thing to observe here is that the energy level of the valence band in the n-region also decreased.
[00:04:15.800 → 00:04:20.800] So, the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band in the n-region remains the same.
[00:04:20.800 → 00:04:26.800] In this video, we discussed about the p-n junction, its formation and the formation of the depletion region.
[00:04:26.800 → 00:04:32.800] We also discussed the barrier potential and the energy diagrams of the p-n junction and the depletion region.
