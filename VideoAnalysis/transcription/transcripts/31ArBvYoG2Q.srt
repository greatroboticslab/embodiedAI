1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When I popped off, then you go gave me...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:15,660
So in this video, we're going to be building the Tyro 69 kit.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,200
Now, this will be a beginner's guide into how to build it, solder it, and what are good techniques to use,

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,440
and some of the issues you might come up against and how to solve them.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,420
So we're going to do this together as fast, efficient, yet full of detail as possible.

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,320
So PCBWay is one of the leading PCB manufacturers that I even use on a daily basis,

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,820
not only to do my projects, but also some of the products that I've designed that's currently in the market,

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,880
like the Drone Mesh VUSB, and I'm constantly using them for prototyping,

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,340
and I'm also using their assembly services, and they also do have flashing services for specific hardware requirements.

10
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,100
So it's a really great place to have your PCB manufactured or prototyped.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,740
All right, so let's talk about some of the tools we're going to need, because we're not going to really need much,

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:59,120
and also some tools I'd highly recommend, which have dropped in price pretty insane.

13
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,600
So this right here is a soldering iron. This is a portable soldering iron.

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,520
This thing used to go for $80, $90. That's when I got mine, and right now it's like $40 or $50.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,400
This is the thing that I carry with me to the field always.

16
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,180
I replaced big motors, big XC60, and I'd highly recommend this little tool, and it can run as your main driver.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,840
I've had this running as my main driver before, because it is just a well-built beast, and anybody would tell you that.

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,220
So for this build, we're actually going to be using this to show you how good it actually is,

19
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:34,540
and we're using this flat tip that it comes with. This will be really good, especially for this small stuff right here.

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,480
Also, something that's not included in the kit is the tools.

21
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,940
I do highly recommend this tool right here. I've been using it for quite a while.

22
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,300
You'll probably see it in a couple of my videos.

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,960
If you are thinking of getting into drones, this is a must-have tool, because this is titanium-coated,

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,540
and these are hex drivers, and every single size you're going to need, which is 1.5mm all the way up to 3mm.

25
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,200
Usually, all micros are 1.5mm, and that's the only thing we're going to be using for this whole build.

26
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,420
So we're just going to stick this one on and take it out, and especially in the field, this is very useful,

27
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:06,380
because it takes less space, so you just carry those and then just put them in here.

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,540
Next thing that we're going to need, which they don't provide, is a receiver.

29
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,160
Now, I'm going to be using the XM Plus radio here.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,880
If you're using FlySky, then they have other receivers.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,560
However, I'll have some iBus receivers, which are FlySky receivers linked down below,

32
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,540
and I'll also have some FRSky receivers for the FRSky system.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,780
So again, I'm using XM Plus.

34
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,620
They're super cheap.

35
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,900
They get great distance and really great to use overall.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,300
All right, so now let's take a closer look at what the package actually gives you.

37
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,520
It gives you a bunch of propellers, which is something you're going to need,

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,720
and that's quite a lot, which is really nice, and they've also labeled them for you.

39
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,680
So this would be the R.

40
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,720
This would be the normal, and we'll get into how to place these in a bit.

41
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,420
Now, they provide you with the four motors, almost cut to the exact length you'll need,

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,740
but I'm going to show you a nice trick to keep it super clean

43
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:55,360
and reduces your chance of actually ruining something when soldering these motors.

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,620
So they give you the motors.

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,380
They're 1105, 8,500 kV.

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,100
Sorry, 1104, 8,500 kV.

47
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,380
And the 8,500 kV is what I consider the sweet spot for these types of builds

48
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,040
because you can run either a 2SHV or a 3SHV and still enjoy and get a bunch of efficiency.

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,900
I will also have these motors tested on my benchmark in a later video

50
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,160
so we can compare it to the other motors in the market.

51
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,620
Now, they will give you every single connector you're going to need,

52
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,260
and what's really nice about this, you're not going to have to solder much.

53
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:30,040
All you're going to have to solder is your receiver, the XT30, and the motors, and that's about it.

54
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,540
So here we have three wires, five, so with the two here, so that's five wires.

55
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,700
And then here we have three times three, which is, oh, sorry, three times four, which is 12.

56
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,900
So we have a total of 17 things to solder, and everything else is using connectors.

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,300
So also something really nice with the kit is they give you the camera already pre-soldered and ready

58
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,400
with just the connectors here, and I'll show you where those go.

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,620
Those will go on the flight controller.

60
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,800
All we have to do is connect them, insert it into the 3D printed part to hold it in place,

61
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,320
and we'll be done with the camera in VTX, which makes our life really, really easy.

62
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,200
Also, the ESC they're using is actually a pretty good ESC.

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,360
I'm quite surprised at the ESC they're using.

64
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,180
I'm pretty sure you'll probably break the thing before you ever burn this ESC.

65
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,720
But then again, this is all theoretical.

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,020
Just because the filtration is really good, especially for something of this size,

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,720
and the fact that they even provide you with an installed 150 microfarad low ESR capacitor here.

68
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,620
And it is a Rubicon, which is pretty insane.

69
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,940
That's a well-known brand.

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,940
It's a pretty good brand here.

71
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
However, we're going to have to shorten these leads,

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,100
or you're more than likely to actually ruin this thing if these two touch the carbon fiber frame

73
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,940
because it's going to be sitting solo to the frame.

74
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,980
So once we get into that step, we'll take a closer look at that.

75
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,600
Now, for the flight controller, they're providing us with an F4 flight controller,

76
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,480
which is really great.

77
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,740
And it has all the features.

78
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,760
We have the OSD here.

79
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,540
We have, I think, an MPU 6000 gyro, USB.

80
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,080
Obviously, everything has USB.

81
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,020
And connectors for everything you're going to need.

82
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,220
So usually, I'd recommend we start with the flight controller here.

83
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,860
But the flight controller doesn't need anything soldered onto it.

84
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,660
And it's just connectors.

85
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,880
So we're going to keep it for later.

86
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,940
So for this ESC, it does matter which way you place it,

87
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,940
or else you have a nightmare and you won't know why.

88
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,640
With the arrow here pointing forward, this should be on top.

89
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,980
Because if it's not on top, it'll never fly.

90
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,520
Because the motor ordering will be completely different.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,780
So keep that in mind.

92
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,140
Now, when I mentioned earlier that the motor wires were almost perfect length.

93
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,900
So instead of cutting them and making ourselves a bit more time,

94
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,420
and just making it more time consuming,

95
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,640
we can do a nice little trick that'll make it look like a professional's job.

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,160
All right.

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,100
So the first thing now I want to do is I want to just apply power.

98
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,040
I have this little cheap wool adapter that actually fits here,

99
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,760
and it's 12 volts.

100
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,640
And we can go ahead and start this guy up.

101
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,740
I just want to see what temperature I have it set to,

102
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,480
because I don't know.

103
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
400, which is maximum.

104
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,400
This comes with different crazy firmwares that you can set up.

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,660
I just left it on default.

106
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,960
And we can watch how quickly it heats up.

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,860
It depends on the power supply that you're using for it.

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,720
It just dictates how fast it heats up.

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,380
So we'll just let that heat up real quick.

110
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,180
Now, something you should always be aware of here.

111
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,340
If you're going to set your temperature slightly higher than,

112
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,080
let's say, 350 degrees Celsius,

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,880
you want to add solder.

114
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,320
Keep adding solder onto this every, you know,

115
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,840
like a couple minutes or so,

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,020
and cleaning it off.

117
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,720
Because before you start soldering,

118
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,280
you always want it to look like this.

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,680
You want it to look super shiny and super clean.

120
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,980
And that means that the heat's going to transfer very quickly.

121
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,820
And you're not going to hold it there for half an hour.

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,600
Nothing happens.

123
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,380
And that is a usual case why, for example,

124
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,020
the wire would not stick to the pad.

125
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,860
And another thing to take note of here

126
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,360
is you don't want to hit it with the tip just like this.

127
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,540
You want to actually kind of get as much of a flat area as possible

128
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,640
to land on it.

129
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,960
So if it's not really melting,

130
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,360
then kind of just do this little twisting motion

131
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
and it'll push that wire right into place.

132
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,620
Now, I did hire a new assistant

133
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,380
and I've actually noticed a couple things he was doing wrong,

134
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,780
which I was really hoping that I'm going to come here

135
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,520
and show you today.

136
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,280
And I'm very happy that that's going to happen.

137
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,700
So for the ESC, what we want to do first,

138
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,200
we want to add the solder to the pads.

139
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,580
This is the top here.

140
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,860
But the trick here is we're going to add them to the bottom.

141
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
And why is that?

142
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,320
It's so we can make the motor wires really nice and clean.

143
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:59,380
So we're going to start adding solder to the pads.

144
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,100
Now, take a note of where I'm starting.

145
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,080
I'm starting from the left here,

146
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,160
but this is really dangerous

147
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,960
because I can have some solder come to here

148
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,740
and burn a component off.

149
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,660
So instead, I'm just going to go here

150
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,900
because I have less risk of actually burning anything

151
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,400
coming down to the right.

152
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,280
What I like to do first always is touch the pad

153
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,160
and then add the solder to both the pad

154
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,920
and the soldering tip.

155
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:22,340
And there we go.

156
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,040
We have our first little solder blob thingy.

157
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,820
Now, again, I'm touching half of the pad here

158
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,980
and I'm going to come and just add the solder on the pad.

159
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,160
And there we go.

160
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,600
Now, as you can tell,

161
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,860
my soldering iron tip is getting pretty full and dirty.

162
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,840
So I'm just going to clean it slightly.

163
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,340
Now, if you are using water,

164
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,480
the temperature will drop slightly.

165
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,940
So you'd want to just wait a tiny bit

166
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,220
and make sure the tip is back up to temperature here.

167
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,780
But we're soldering at 400 degrees right now.

168
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,100
So it should be pretty good.

169
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,220
And you can kind of see the technique.

170
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,880
Try to understand what I'm doing here.

171
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,720
And don't be scared of keeping the tip on for too long.

172
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,600
I mean, don't keep it on for like 30 seconds.

173
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,820
But it's fine if you keep it there for five seconds.

174
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,620
That's totally fine.

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,740
I'll even show you that right now.

176
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,040
So I have the tip.

177
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:13,860
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

178
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,100
Nothing happened.

179
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,680
You see that?

180
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,680
And did you see how it flicked?

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,620
That's very dangerous

182
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,460
because this little solder blob right there

183
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,840
could have landed somewhere here

184
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,720
and I couldn't see it.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,340
And once I applied the battery,

186
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,900
then the whole ESC could short circuit.

187
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,240
And then people start complaining,

188
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,280
oh, this is the worst product on the planet.

189
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,660
And that usually does happen actually quite a lot.

190
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,180
So we'll just add a little bit more here

191
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,200
and add a little bit more here.

192
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,860
You want to see them really shiny.

193
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,560
So that's really good.

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,900
There we go.

195
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,120
See, this last one wasn't really great.

196
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,240
So how would you fix one that's sticking up like this?

197
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
You kind of see that.

198
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,740
You just come in just really flat

199
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,760
and then just push out.

200
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,680
And that looks really great.

201
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,960
So now we've added that.

202
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,780
Now, what's really great with these wires

203
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,660
is they have some solder on them.

204
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,600
So it's just going to make our life a little bit easier.

205
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,280
Now, if they didn't, you'd want to strip them,

206
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,520
twist them and add solder

207
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,160
before you solder to the pads here.

208
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,640
So and again, keep in mind,

209
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
this is the bottom side right now.

210
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,900
And we're going to do something

211
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,780
a little bit different here.

212
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,320
So what I'm going to do is

213
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,540
I'm going to straighten out the wires

214
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,940
just like that.

215
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,340
And I'm actually going to install them like this.

216
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,320
So I'm going to do again,

217
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,200
start from this side

218
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,100
so I don't risk damaging a component here.

219
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,560
So I'm going to come like this

220
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,840
and then install that right there.

221
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,080
Now, a really nice technique to do this

222
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,620
is to heat up the pad first,

223
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,040
just slightly,

224
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,520
and then come in with the wire.

225
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,940
And you don't have to be in a hurry.

226
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,760
Just take your time

227
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,420
and put that into place.

228
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,980
Now, we didn't have much solder

229
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,260
on the pad already,

230
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,180
but we'll come back and fix that later.

231
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,140
Let's move on to the second one here.

232
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,240
So there we go.

233
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,360
So here's the other one.

234
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,420
We're going to add some heat,

235
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,540
melt the pad,

236
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:55,640
and then come back on top of the wire here.

237
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:57,700
There we go.

238
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,520
And we're going to do the same thing to this one.

239
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
You could trim these off.

240
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,880
I'd highly recommend you trim them off

241
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,340
before you start soldering.

242
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,120
So there we go.

243
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,700
And be careful touching the ESE.

244
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,980
It's actually toasty right now.

245
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,900
Really, really toasty.

246
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,960
So the whole idea of why I did it this way

247
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,940
is because when we flip it over,

248
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,540
it's going to look really nice once you install it.

249
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,500
So these motor wires will just go in like this

250
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,160
and they'll be really flat

251
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,280
and it'll just be perfect.

252
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,020
It's not going to have any bends or creases or anything

253
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,060
that's sticking out of the quadcopter

254
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,180
for it to catch on anything.

255
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,180
But as you can tell,

256
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,540
these were slightly longer than we'd like them to be.

257
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,400
And I'll come back and fix this later.

258
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
And here we're going to do one more together.

259
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,560
Now, if you're going to cut wire,

260
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,080
never cut wires on top of any component

261
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,600
because it could also create a pretty big nightmare.

262
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,560
So I'm going to trim these slightly a bit here

263
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,700
and I'm going to do the same thing.

264
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,640
And again, taking I am on the bottom again,

265
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,580
there is no arrow here.

266
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,320
Now, the motor wire order doesn't really matter right now.

267
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,040
So because the whole idea here is

268
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,380
you can always anytime

269
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,360
if the motor is not spinning in the correct direction,

270
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,500
just flip any two wires

271
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
and it'll spin in the right direction.

272
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,780
So don't stress that part too much right now.

273
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,520
There we go.

274
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,860
And right now I'm not really heating up the pad

275
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,680
because it's a really small pad

276
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,960
and the heat is going to transfer really well.

277
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,180
So here, I just want to...

278
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,680
There we go.

279
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,840
All right.

280
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,720
So this is on 400 right now.

281
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,900
So you're going to have the same exact experience as me

282
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,020
while you're soldering.

283
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,200
Just make sure you're comfortable.

284
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,020
That's one of the most important things

285
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,780
when you're soldering, in my opinion,

286
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,820
is you're comfortable.

287
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:38,960
Okay.

288
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:39,980
Nothing is touching.

289
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,700
They're very well-placed paths.

290
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,200
They're very far apart from each other.

291
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,420
And this one, again,

292
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,400
I'm going to come back and fix up later on.

293
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:47,940
All right.

294
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,540
So I'm going to skip the rest of the motors

295
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,460
and then we'll see what is the next step.

296
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,800
All right.

297
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,680
So now when we're done,

298
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,380
we should have something that looks like this.

299
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,620
Now, the next thing I want to do

300
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,240
is actually remove this low ESR capacitor.

301
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,760
And it's going to be a little bit tricky

302
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
because we're going to have to heat up this side

303
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,240
because it's actually sticking in

304
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,620
through the hole right here.

305
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,020
Or we can do something just a lot easier

306
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,800
and we can actually just cut it.

307
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,880
I mean, that'll just work really great.

308
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,320
There we go.

309
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
We don't really have to worry about these

310
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,420
and they can even stay in there.

311
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,460
It's not really a big problem.

312
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:14,840
All right.

313
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,460
So now once the capacitor is removed or cut off,

314
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,800
we're left with shorter leads

315
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,460
and this is exactly what we want.

316
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,300
However, what we also want to do is

317
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,860
since it was on the bottom side,

318
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,880
we actually want to put it on the upper side.

319
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,460
However, we're going to leave this step for now

320
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,960
and bring in our XT30

321
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,800
where our battery will be connected,

322
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,420
supplying power to the whole micro quadcopter here.

323
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,940
Now I want to install this on the bottom side

324
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,540
and you'll see why

325
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,240
once we actually start putting this together,

326
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,700
it reduces the chances of the positive and negative

327
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,580
touching the carbon fiber frame

328
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,820
because it is conductive

329
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,460
so we don't have a short circuit

330
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,620
and blow the whole thing up.

331
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,020
So I'm going to come in

332
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,700
and I'm just going to add solder to the pad.

333
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,180
Same thing we did with the motor wires.

334
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,380
Same thing here.

335
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,420
Now, if you have the same soldering iron,

336
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,040
you need to take something into consideration.

337
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,580
If you leave it for a while,

338
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,920
then it'll just go into sleep mode

339
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,340
and drop the temperature.

340
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,780
So you might just have to wait

341
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,380
just a tiny bit for it to come back.

342
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,600
It won't drop it all the way to zero

343
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,480
and it'll quickly gain its temperature back.

344
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,860
So now we've added solder to that.

345
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,140
Now, here's a really nice technique.

346
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,460
I usually like to bring my solder

347
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,560
and just stand it up straight,

348
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,760
even though these have solder on it,

349
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,380
but I don't know how old it is.

350
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,900
So I stand it up straight

351
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,220
and then I would come in,

352
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,940
add solder to the bottom of my soldering iron,

353
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,300
tip,

354
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,300
and then start following along

355
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,520
just like this while holding the wire.

356
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,960
And now I have a really nice solder on the wire.

357
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,080
However, you need to take something into consideration.

358
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,360
The wire will get really hot

359
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,080
and it's actually really toasty right now.

360
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,740
So as you can tell,

361
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,640
I'm not holding it anymore.

362
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,400
So keep that in mind also.

363
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,700
Heat is real,

364
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,840
especially when you're soldering.

365
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,200
It might not look like there's no heat,

366
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
but there's a ton of heat.

367
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
And if it touches you,

368
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,280
you're going to burn yourself.

369
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,460
All right.

370
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,300
So now we're going to install the battery

371
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,120
into place here or the XT60.

372
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:58,500
And again,

373
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,120
look,

374
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,100
we are on the bottom side of the board.

375
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,140
So I'm going to heat up the pad

376
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,100
because these are bigger pads.

377
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,840
And then I'm going to come in

378
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,560
with the soldering iron on top of the wire.

379
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,140
And that should give us a really nice connection.

380
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,200
And that wire got really hot very fast.

381
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,020
So here we go.

382
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:16,520
And again,

383
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,460
make sure the plus is the red wire

384
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,740
and the minus or the negative is the black wire.

385
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,380
And there we go.

386
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,500
Try to resist the heat

387
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,400
and keep it into place

388
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,640
after you move the soldering iron

389
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,860
for everything to cool.

390
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,240
So now we're basically almost done.

391
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,780
All we need to solder here now

392
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,620
is the low ESR capacitor back into place.

393
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,080
And how does this go back into place?

394
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,600
Well,

395
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,000
wherever these dash signs are,

396
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,880
this will go to the ground,

397
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,620
which is the negative.

398
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,940
And then the other side

399
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,960
is just going to go to the positive.

400
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:44,900
And here,

401
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,740
since we know we put these in the correct way,

402
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,380
so we just put the negative side to the black here

403
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,460
and then the other side to the red.

404
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,120
So let's do this together here.

405
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:53,740
Now,

406
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,760
it's also really nice to add solder onto this.

407
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,920
It'll help slightly transfer the heat a little bit better.

408
00:14:59,420 --> 00:14:59,680
And again,

409
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm just going to stand up my solder

410
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,220
and just touch it here.

411
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,440
Just add on this.

412
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,480
Sometimes it won't stick.

413
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,820
It might not look like anything,

414
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,940
but it'll help in the long run here.

415
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,220
All right.

416
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,380
And this side where it has the dashes,

417
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,480
as you can tell,

418
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,860
is going to go to the ground.

419
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,620
But I'm going to start with the positive

420
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,540
because I think it'll be a little bit easier for me.

421
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,040
So I'm going to push this one

422
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,440
a little bit out of the way for now.

423
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,840
We could always bring it back into place.

424
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,280
So I'm going to heat up the pad.

425
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,920
Now we're on top of the ESC here.

426
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,760
So I'm going to heat up the pad here.

427
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,440
And then I'm going to bring in this guy into place.

428
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,920
You don't want to heat up the pad too much

429
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,580
because it might desolder the bottom one.

430
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,900
So keep that in mind.

431
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,800
All right.

432
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,540
Now I'm going to do the same thing here.

433
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,100
I'm going to heat up the pad.

434
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,720
Try not to touch anything like I did.

435
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,340
Okay.

436
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,220
There we go.

437
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,320
And that should not be touching anytime soon

438
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,880
because now the frame,

439
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,460
the carbon fiber is on the bottom here.

440
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,980
Even if this were to bend,

441
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,820
it's not going to touch the frame

442
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,520
because this is acting as an insulator

443
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,600
because it's pushing it away.

444
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,500
However, if this twists and these two touch together,

445
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,120
then you'll have a really big problem.

446
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:13,880
This will probably pop,

447
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,520
but it's not really high voltage,

448
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,840
but you know, just, yeah, just be careful.

449
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,040
So now the ESC is basically done

450
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,920
and it looks like a moving spider here.

451
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,080
Look at this.

452
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:24,940
Wait.

453
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:25,520
All right.

454
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,820
So now we have the frame into place

455
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,360
and you want to bring in the longest screws

456
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,020
and there's only four of these guys.

457
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,120
So let's bring those into place.

458
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,840
We're just going to install them

459
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,120
and keeping them standing.

460
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,220
Up for now.

461
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,520
This is the easiest way to do it.

462
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,140
So right now they're just standing into place.

463
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm going to lift this up.

464
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,520
They're going to go right in,

465
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,340
flip it over and then put it down.

466
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,260
So now the screws are all standing up here.

467
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,440
We're going to get any four of these,

468
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,420
you know, these little dampeners here.

469
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,180
I'm just going to install them into the frame.

470
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,220
So now we have one on each screw here.

471
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,500
So the thing is,

472
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,260
I don't want to lift it up

473
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,100
because they're all going to come down

474
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
unless I hold it like this.

475
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:02,940
There you go.

476
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,080
You can kind of see that now.

477
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,720
So the next step is obviously insert the ESC,

478
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,820
but it does matter how you insert the ESC.

479
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,480
You want the holes to be on the side

480
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,920
so the battery will hold like this

481
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,220
unless you want the battery in another way.

482
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:14,920
That's your decision.

483
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:18,320
But usually the battery is forward and back.

484
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,280
So you want these to be on the sides,

485
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,380
the holes to be on the side.

486
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,540
And then we're going to figure out where's the front.

487
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,760
We're going to call that the front.

488
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,800
So we want to make sure that the arrow is on top

489
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,640
so we can see it

490
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,960
and that it's pointing forward.

491
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,000
And that is perfect.

492
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,340
And we're just going to slide this guy right in.

493
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,280
And now we're going to install the motor screws,

494
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,240
which I'll skip over.

495
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,580
However, the screw is going to be this one

496
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,260
and it's not going to be very hard to find it

497
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,960
because you only get four long screws

498
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
and a bunch of these little ones

499
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,780
that are exactly the same size.

500
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,000
And those are for your motors.

501
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,400
So I'm going to go ahead and start doing that.

502
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:47,620
All right.

503
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,740
So once the motors are installed,

504
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,920
it's going to look something like this.

505
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,580
Now what you want to take note of is

506
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,240
it's going to kind of act like a spring

507
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,600
because of the motor wire.

508
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,460
So what you want to do is push kind of hard,

509
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,700
just allow them to bend into place here.

510
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,960
Make sure all the motor wires are going from the inside part

511
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,360
to make your life a little bit easier.

512
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,680
So the next step is to add more of these little rubber ones

513
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,760
and they're all the same size.

514
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,000
They're actually, it seemed like it used to be like a tube

515
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,940
and they just had one guy cutting it piece by piece.

516
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,600
So they're not all cut perfect,

517
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,100
but I mean, what do you expect for 70 bucks or something?

518
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,900
So here's the arrow pointing forward.

519
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,180
Now this is very important also.

520
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,440
So the arrow is pointing forward.

521
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,020
You want to find the arrow also on the flight controller,

522
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,380
which is right there.

523
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,120
It's right in the middle right there.

524
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,980
It's saying this way.

525
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,880
So I'm going to install the quadcopter like this

526
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,920
and that's the arrow.

527
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,180
And then I have my four rubbers here.

528
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,820
So there we go.

529
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,860
My arrows forward.

530
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,220
Awesome.

531
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,240
So now we have those set into place.

532
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,460
Now I'm going to bring in some more rubbers

533
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,580
right on top of this.

534
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,260
They provide you with a total of 12, 12, no, nine, no 12.

535
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,060
So they give you a total of 12 here

536
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,280
and we have those set into place.

537
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,480
And I'm just going to give you an example here

538
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
without having to lose these.

539
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,020
So you can kind of see how it is.

540
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
We have one rubber, two rubber, three rubber here.

541
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,580
All right.

542
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,880
So now let's connect the electronic speed controller

543
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,780
or the ESC to the flight controller.

544
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,820
And it's done with this connector right here.

545
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,320
It's the biggest and shortest one.

546
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,820
So this connector is going to connect right into the big connector

547
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,220
up in front of the flight controller, which is the arrow.

548
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
That's going to go straight down.

549
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,860
Now, if it's not going in, then you want to flip the connector

550
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,460
and just be careful.

551
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,680
Don't force it in.

552
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,020
It'll go in very nicely if it's in the correct orientation.

553
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,080
There we go.

554
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,060
That's really nice.

555
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,380
We're going to bend this slightly here

556
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,340
because we don't want this hanging out later on

557
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,040
and getting caught with a propeller.

558
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,960
So now the ESC is actually connected.

559
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,500
So if we actually gave this power right now, the motors would light up

560
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,660
and the flight controller will light up and just about everything.

561
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,520
All we're missing are the camera and the receiver.

562
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,140
So let's go ahead and prepare the receiver

563
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,040
and I'll show you how this will actually work.

564
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,140
So I'm going to just cut these off just like that.

565
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,920
And these are not silicone for some reason or some sort of...

566
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,480
So stripping these might be a bit difficult

567
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,940
if you don't have the correct tools

568
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,200
or you don't have the experience to do it.

569
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,120
So I just did it with a little cutter right here.

570
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,340
All right.

571
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,260
So now I've gone ahead and twisted the wires up top here.

572
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,480
Once I stripped them, I'm just going to add some solder to these

573
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,900
because these are going to go into our receiver here.

574
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,280
And the other side where the white connector is,

575
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,240
is going to go into the flight controller.

576
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,720
So I'm going to trim these wires because they're a bit too long.

577
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,040
And again, don't cut or solder on top of any electrical component

578
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,840
nor the motors themselves.

579
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,080
So keep that in mind.

580
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
So here I have my XM plus radio

581
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,420
and I'm going to go ahead and solder onto it.

582
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,460
Now, if I remember correctly, this is SBUS.

583
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,880
And then I think it's 5 volt, then it's ground.

584
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,680
But I could be wrong.

585
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,920
I'll double check later, but I'm going to install them like that right now.

586
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,300
So if you had IBUS, then the yellow wire would be your signal, your IBUS.

587
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,240
And if you had SBUS, then the yellow wire would be your SBUS.

588
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,800
However, we do need to make a modification on the flight controller for the receiver to actually work,

589
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,220
which is choosing if it's going to be IBUS or if it's going to be an SBUS.

590
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,740
And this is very important that you know the difference

591
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,900
and know what your transmitter could broadcast that.

592
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,420
All right.

593
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,840
So now we have the receiver here.

594
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,260
So the modification we're going to have to do to the flight controller

595
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:24,280
is going to be somewhere pretty, pretty tiny, which is these three pads right here.

596
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,860
Now, if you're going to be using SBUS, these three pads here,

597
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,540
the middle one is going to have to be bridged with the left one.

598
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,420
If you're using IBUS or PPM, then the middle one is going to have to be bridged with the right one.

599
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,680
Don't bridge all of them together.

600
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,100
So let's try to attempt this together here.

601
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,820
This is really nice, but I wish these pads were slightly larger to help new people

602
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,080
because it can be pretty hard.

603
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,740
See, like right now, you see how difficult it is for me to solder?

604
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:57,800
That's because it went to sleep mode and then the temperature now is just coming back up.

605
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:58,580
All right.

606
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,400
So now they're bridging.

607
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,260
I do apologize.

608
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,640
I just looked up and it turns out I had it off camera

609
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,140
because I had to bring it closer to me.

610
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,800
And you can see now the middle one is bridged with the left one here

611
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
because I'm using SBUS.

612
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,660
And again, if you're IBUS, you bridge the middle one with the right one.

613
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,300
And that's what we did here.

614
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,600
So now our receiver is ready and we're basically done.

615
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,440
So we just got to connect everything up together.

616
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,020
All right, guys.

617
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,040
So next we want to install the camera into the little canopy here.

618
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,960
Now, I'd highly recommend you add some like double-sided tape behind the VTX.

619
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,220
Now, it's very important that you see the solder is coming up from this side.

620
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,660
And also you have this little extra piece taken out.

621
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,680
It's telling you, oh, the antenna is going to go on this side.

622
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,300
So it has the hole for the button here.

623
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,040
Now, this will go into sideways.

624
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,680
If you have it the other way, it'll just it just won't fit.

625
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,240
So you have to put it in the correct way.

626
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,880
And the wires, I've routed them through the back of the VTX down this hole.

627
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,900
So now to know where these actually connect.

628
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,880
Well, let's take a closer look.

629
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,740
So here's the arrow.

630
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:56,640
The VTX is going to go here or the four pin connector is going to go here

631
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,620
because it's a four and a three pin connector.

632
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:02,440
So this is the VTX here and that's in.

633
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,100
And then the other one is the front one here.

634
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,240
So again, here's the arrow.

635
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,440
The USB is on the left.

636
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,860
So this one here is where the camera would go in.

637
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,800
And if you actually take a closer look at your board, if you do have this,

638
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,000
you'll see the word cam right in between the big connector and the little connector.

639
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,180
So now we have that in place.

640
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,240
And obviously, we want the camera to point forward.

641
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,280
So now once you put the nuts in place, don't think you have to tighten it from up here.

642
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,720
So what we're going to do is we're going to have something holding up from the top

643
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,540
and then we'll just use the screw driver from the bottom or the hex driver from the bottom

644
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,180
to actually tighten it as we please.

645
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,860
Now, try not to bend the VTX antenna so much because it'll probably end up breaking.

646
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,660
And that goes for a lot of wires.

647
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,480
So that goes even for motor wires as well.

648
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,460
So keep that in mind.

649
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,760
Try not to keep hitting it by mistake because soldering one of those back into place

650
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,500
is much more difficult, especially if you're new.

651
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,540
All right.

652
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,160
So right now we're just tightening everything here.

653
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,360
And like I mentioned before, you don't have to keep it.

654
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,860
Just get the nut to grip.

655
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,260
And then that's what she said.

656
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:05,640
Yeah.

657
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,980
So just get the nut to grip.

658
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,860
And that should be good in that perspective.

659
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,700
I had to redo this part a bunch of times because that's what she said.

660
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:17,960
All right.

661
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,580
All right.

662
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,140
And this is how it's supposed to look like when it's complete.

663
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,800
Really nice.

664
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,420
Really simple.

665
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,740
The guts are kind of sticking out, but that was the whole idea here.

666
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:30,420
It's supposed to be all exposed, super light, 20 by 20 stack, which is actually pretty good

667
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,760
that it's using a 20 by 20 stack.

668
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,980
And again, if you take a look at the low ESR capacitor, this is the reason why I told

669
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:38,060
you you want to solder it on top of the ESC instead of the bottom.

670
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,840
So the battery wires here will not allow it to bend any further and touch this carbon

671
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,340
fiber because it was also pretty long.

672
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,920
So it would easily touch the carbon fiber, short circuited the whole thing.

673
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
So keep that in mind.

674
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,020
That's something really important.

675
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,880
Also, if you're new, I actually don't recommend you add your motor wires to the bottom of the

676
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,200
ESC.

677
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,900
I'd probably do it on top of the ESC.

678
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,920
It'd probably be a little bit easier and keep the extra slack and do something else with

679
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,120
it.

680
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,260
But if you just push it, it'll be fine.

681
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,960
But it might be a bit fiddly for you if you don't have much experience.

682
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,340
Also, the VTX here, it seems pretty stable, but I would definitely add some sort of something

683
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,520
to hold it in place.

684
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:20,380
I wouldn't add a zip tie because zip ties usually will tend to rip off components from

685
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:20,620
here.

686
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:23,640
So I'd probably add some double sided tape right below here.

687
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,700
Hot glue won't work because if you add hot glue, it'll just basically melt because these

688
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,740
do get pretty toasty.

689
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,720
And for this antenna here, I'd want to secure it with possibly some sort of a zip tie that's

690
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,300
going to go through here to here and just stick out like that.

691
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,000
And then I'll just heat shrink something on top of it.

692
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,040
And I'll actually do that.

693
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,380
All right.

694
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,300
So what I've done here is I should have actually left the zip tie slightly longer.

695
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,780
But what I've done is obviously I brought a little fatter heat shrink, put it on top,

696
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,740
and now it's holding the VTX with the heat shrink.

697
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,300
And that's not going anywhere.

698
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,280
It's just going to stay there.

699
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,860
And you don't want this to keep playing because it'll eventually break off the solder like

700
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,880
with any other wire.

701
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,260
And it's looking pretty nice to be honest.

702
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,600
I really like that yellow on there.

703
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,280
Now what you'll be left with is the receiver.

704
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,580
Right now it's like one in the morning and I really am tired and I just not going to have

705
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,040
a nice solution for this just yet.

706
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,580
But you can get creative.

707
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,920
Like what I'm thinking of doing is probably putting it somewhere here on the side because

708
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,680
there are some holes.

709
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:27,800
Put a heat shrink around this and then use double-sided tape to hold it into place.

710
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,620
I wouldn't put this on top of the flight controller because this is loose.

711
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,420
And then these little touches will touch the gyro and make it do weird stuff.

712
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:40,100
So you'll just not have a really pleasant experience and you won't know why.

713
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,780
So the best thing overall to do is to put it somewhere here on the side just like this.

714
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,160
And I'll figure that out in a later video.

715
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:52,820
Or I might even design and 3D print something else for this quadcopter and I'll share it

716
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,420
with you guys.

717
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,120
So I'll be flying this within the next two days once the rain clears up because now we're

718
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,280
starting to rain here.

719
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,740
And I'll show you the final result of how I got it to be and share everything else with

720
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,000
you guys.

721
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,120
But this is how you build it.

722
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,240
All you need to do is find a placement for your receiver.

723
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,120
And it's 1 in the morning right now so I'm really tired and I can't really think of anything

724
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,900
to do for that.

725
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,800
And again, all the links are down below.

726
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,700
If you could check them out, it does really support the channel.

727
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,060
I'll have links to the batteries to use for this.

728
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:22,460
I'll also have the links for the heat shrinks, the tools I use, and that soldering iron that

729
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,140
we just used for this whole build here.

730
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,040
And I'll see you in the next one.

731
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:27,700
Peace out.
