what a useless lecture...rubbish....deadlines my ass

This is for ROS1 or ROS2?

when i try launch the smb_gazebo package from the given exercise, it throws this error:  when instantiating macro: LIDAR .............. anybody have any idea whats going on?

This is very useful, thanks !

Thanks a ton for this!  Its a great refresher for my upcoming job interview

for 17:17, is there a rospy equivalent?  I tried typing rospy but I'm not getting anything

This is such a helpful course. Thank you so much for uploading!!!

Very nice to know in a light way what Robot Operating Stystems is. I reccomend this video to everyone who has time, a little patiance and most impportant, interest in learning the subjetc with you are propably about to start working.  Nice job ! Congrats !

Is this still up to date? :)

Thank you very much! what a nice course

Thank you for that excellent lecture

does ros work in windows ?

I have been struggling ROS since last couple of weeks. Everybody starts with installing and then some example also they have a title that it's for beginners :(  This the only session I have ended up is exactly for one who is really a beginner. After watching first half of the video I could connect dots.   Thanks to the whole team :)

13:30 oh no, our messages are compromised! :o the identities of our undercover agents are revealed?! :S :S

Thank you Prof. Fankhauser and ETH for these great lessons!

why don't ros use more traditional names like session/ thread, instead of topic/node etc

This lecture series looks really good, but is it still relevant? I'm using the ROS Melodic build, which is later than Indigo. I assume that the majority of the stuff is the same, especially since in the ROS wiki tutorials it essentially says "yeah just replace the build in the file path with whatever build you have" so that tells me they're all similar. I just want to make sure though.

can you say how did you install ros and using which platform(OS) to master ROS

and then a terminator came at 15:58... I'm outta here man... way too dangerous around here

@70ME3E  lol

idhr mujhe kuch samajh nhi aaya aur tu thanks bol rha hai....

Congratulations for this lecture, thanks!

Hi, can you update the link for the slides. Excellent work btw!

thanks! pls can u pls send this ROS software to me

In case somebody was looking for the slides --> https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html

Guys can someone tell me why ROS exists? I mean why it is needed. I am a mechanical engineer, but I need a real case to understand and get it clear in my mind. Can someone make an analogy to describe the ROS and its requirements for the robotics? What was the problem in the past so that they have created ROS? Thanks in advance

Gracias MARTIN !!!

Hi Robotic Systems Lab, I have downloaded the Ubuntu_ROS_course virtual disk and used it on VMware, it runs fine, however, I have a little problem with the keyboard layout. For example, when I press the Z button it becomes Y and vice versa, I think it because this is Germany layout right? How could I change to US layout? Thanks for sharing the course

boring tuts

Excellent!! I have made a video on ROS Meldodic LTS installation here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKlk_2EGfM4

Can you please repost the link to the slides? It is broken.

Thank you very much for publishing these and so many resources!

What does it mean when you rosrun your package and the node but it produces Segmentation fault (core dumped) ?

It looks like the slides link is not working. Is there another way we can download this file?

is it necessary to learn first the foundations e.g. kinematics, before learning ROS? Thanks a lot.

where can i get the zip file the link is working please tell me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I see that this comment is 4 years old now. Do you still need an answer to this question ?

@omaraissani6255  yes

I was having the same issue. The slides were working a week or so ago and then poof the link stopped working. I did a google and found that one.

Brilliant prelude to my Robotic technicians course online at University of Houston in collaboration with George Brown college ,Ontario. Thank you Prof.Alberto Ezquerro.

It looks like the Ubuntu_ROS_Course.zip link is not working. Is there another way we can download this file?

Help me out please? in this video 33:25 , I entered "roslaunch ros_package_template ros_package_template.launch" but got ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ros_package_template/ros_package_template]: can't locate node [ros_package_template] in package [ros_package_template] Thank you in advance

I need a tutorial  step by step of how to install openRave into ubuntu, please help!!!

i cannot find the world on ur website... nor do i understand what to do with the launch file

are you guys alive ? please upload more content... thanks for help.

Is it not compatible with the ubuntu 16.04?

Excellent introductory videos. I learned a lot more today than in other videos.

Is that zuckerberg talking in the end. Holy Crap.

Do you use ros with anaconda env. ?

Robot Operating System for Absolute Beginners  https://apress.com/us/book/9781484234044

The lecture was perfect how ever i am facing problems in installing the husky-simulator package(the one given in exercise) i am using kinetic distribution

To be honest dont waste your time on watching these videos if you are a beginner. Because its advance level course. And he has skipped many basic things. the packages he has mentioned to to download and build are not working.

33:20 i do like you say, but i get a error when i try to launch that package: "ERROR: cannot launch node of type [ros_package_template/ros_package_template]: can't locate node [ros_package_template] in package [ros_package_template] "

i didn't find the exercises in the website of the course sir!

Please how do we get access to the exercises?

Thanks for sharing, it helps a lot :)

Good Morning  I am Javier Acosta, I am doing a project of Thesis with LINUX 16.04 and ROS in which I need a data acquisition card with analog and digital ports, it is not necessary to be high speed.  Could you recommend a data acquisition card preferably USB with which I can work?   I thank you for your help.  Sincerely  Javier Acot

+1

Thanku so much for posting :)

it's available now

Did you build the package after you added the git files?

Yes, it is compatible with 16.04. Are you facing any problems?

idhr mujhe kuch samajh nhi aaya aur tu thanks bol rha hai....

As far as I know, Ros messes around with (I think) the file structure of Anaconda, so it might be best to only use one or the other on the same machine.

Correction -- this video explains how to make them work well together: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMF20z-gT5s

Thanks for your feedback, Muhammad. Is there anything specific you miss in this course for people new to ROS? Please keep in mind that this is a ROS course and not a programming course and we assume that participants already know how to program. Which packages are not working for you?

ros-kinetic-husky-simulator

@sufyanraza5273  It's not working for me either

Have you solved it? Please share the solution

U r welcome http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html

We have just updated the exercises on the course website: http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html

appreciated :)

It's a well lecture about ROS. Thanks a lot. But When build the sample " ros_best_practice" , something wrong during building process. Then I found the problem: in my hydro distribution, std_srvs lack of Trigger.h file. so  Could you tell me which distribution do you use now? Thanks again

One curious question. How the node structure of ROS is suitable for ROBOTIC applications?

I have made a github repo for the solution to each time's exercise. Please feel free to check. https://github.com/luym11/ros_practise

i have installed ros kinetic, everything seems good other than catkin build command as it does not work. I have tried catkin_make which works but not sure if it will  make any difference.

ROS is cool!

Hi, i have installed ros kinetic un ubuntu 16.  can I build the ros_package_templete on my system? Or does is run only on indigo?   after catkin_make (i dont have the tools) i get this error:   me@me-VirtualBox:~/catkin_ws$ catkin_make ros_package_template Base path: /home/me/catkin_ws Source space: /home/me/catkin_ws/src Build space: /home/me/catkin_ws/build Devel space: /home/me/catkin_ws/devel Install space: /home/me/catkin_ws/install #### #### Running command: "cmake /home/me/catkin_ws/src -DCATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX=/home/me/catkin_ws/devel -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/me/catkin_ws/install -G Unix Makefiles" in "/home/me/catkin_ws/build" #### -- Using CATKIN_DEVEL_PREFIX: /home/me/catkin_ws/devel -- Using CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH: /opt/ros/kinetic -- This workspace overlays: /opt/ros/kinetic -- Using PYTHON_EXECUTABLE: /usr/bin/python -- Using Debian Python package layout -- Using empy: /usr/bin/empy -- Using CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING: ON -- Call enable_testing() -- Using CATKIN_TEST_RESULTS_DIR: /home/me/catkin_ws/src/test_results -- Found gtest sources under '/usr/src/gtest': gtests will be built -- Using Python nosetests: /usr/bin/nosetests-2.7 -- catkin 0.7.6 -- BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is on -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -- ~~  traversing 2 packages in topological order: -- ~~  - ros_package_template -- ~~  - simple_navigation_goals -- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ -- +++ processing catkin package: 'ros_package_template' -- ==> add_subdirectory(ros_package_template) -- +++ processing catkin package: 'simple_navigation_goals' -- ==> add_subdirectory(simple_navigation_goals) -- Using these message generators: gencpp;geneus;genlisp;gennodejs;genpy -- Configuring done -- Generating done -- Build files have been written to: /home/me/catkin_ws/src #### #### Running command: "make ros_package_template -j3 -l3" in "/home/me/catkin_ws/build" #### make: * No rule to make target 'ros_package_template'.

thnx for helping us .

great learning experience

Technically perfect, but i am missing some enthusiasm in your voice. but who cares, great content...

Those who are interested in doing projects using Robot R.O.S. (Robot Operating System), this book is for you :)  ROS Robotics Projects: http://rosrobots.com  #ROS #Robots

Excellent course!! Thank you for uploading!

It is great!

I always say 'duh-vel', but here it is 'devil'.

This is an awesome introductory lecture about ROS. Please keep posting more lectures.

Great!

You should use the Kinetic version of ROS.

Manisha Kad it almost solve all problem  with node moduler approach

Try this: sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools

Thanks a lot

Like your Learning Robotics using Python book alot :D Thank you so much sir

Way too expensive for me sry. Staying with tutorials on youtube.

idhr mujhe kuch samajh nhi aaya aur tu thanks bol rha hai....

the questions is, do I really need to learn ROS? is ROS used in the industry? my experience is "not really". Please name some robots or robotics companies who actually use ROS?

​ @RobotixwithSina    - You can ask the same question for all the existing robotics frameworks. ROS is open source. It has a very large community. It has a lot of useful tools and packages. It supports many robots.  - My experience is that ROS is used in the industry more and more. There are a lot of companies that contribute to ROS 2. https://index.ros.org/doc/ros2/Governance/  - There are a lot of companies that use ROS in their projects and products such as Amazon AWS RoboMaker, Intel, Samsung, Matlab, Fetch Robotics, ApexAi, Clearpath, Robotis, Tier IV Autoware, ADLink, Rover Robotics, Locus Robotics, Freedom Robotics, etc. You can google these companies and learn more about their tools, software, and robots.

@mlherdgn  : Thank you Melih for your comment. I get that a small number of companies may use ROS for maybe testing and automation, but not really for robot development. if you look at the list you provided, the majority are not really a company that develops a robot, they are more of companies who use a robot for automation, research, and testing. but thank you for the info. what field of robotics are you working in?

@RobotixwithSina  Hello,can you tell me please what i need to learn instead of ros?
