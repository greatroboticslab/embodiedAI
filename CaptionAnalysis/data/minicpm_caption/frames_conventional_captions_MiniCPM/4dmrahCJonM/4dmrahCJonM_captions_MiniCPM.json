These are:\n\n1. Manual Mode: In this mode, the pilot has full control over the airplane's movements.\n2. Manual with GPS: This mode allows the pilot to fly the airplane using GPS coordinates.\n3. Autonomous: In this mode, the airplane is controlled by a computer, and the pilot can only monitor its movements.\n\nThe host then goes on to describe the difference between the three modes. Manual Mode allows the pilot to make all the decisions, while Manual with GPS allows the pilot to follow a pre-programmed route. Autonomous Mode, on the other hand, requires the pilot to leave the airplane alone and only monitor its movements.\n\nThe host concludes by saying that these three modes are pre-set in the flight controller, and the pilot can only switch between them.

These flight modes are pre-set and can be easily accessed by the pilot.\n\nAnother important feature of a flight controller is its ability to adjust the aircraft's pitch and roll. Pitch refers to the aircraft's angle of elevation, while roll refers to its angle of rotation. By adjusting these angles, the controller can control the aircraft's movement in the vertical and horizontal planes.\n\nIn summary, a flight controller is a device that helps an aircraft navigate and control its movements.
