[00:00:00.240 → 00:00:02.760] Hi, welcome to Elonix.
[00:00:02.760 → 00:00:08.240] In this episode, we'll see how to make a clap switch or sound triggered LED while simultaneously
[00:00:08.240 → 00:00:16.760] learning how it works.
[00:00:16.760 → 00:00:30.600] This circuit detected claps upto a distance of about 15 feet.
[00:00:30.600 → 00:00:37.560] And if you are near, the LED turns on even with finger snaps.
[00:00:37.560 → 00:00:41.960] You can also change the sensitivity so that it turns on the LED only when you clap near
[00:00:41.960 → 00:00:49.080] the circuit.
[00:00:49.080 → 00:00:55.240] We'll be using a condenser or elaterate microphone as the sensing element and its capacitance
[00:00:55.240 → 00:00:58.520] changes in response to ambient sound.
[00:00:58.520 → 00:01:03.680] So we'll start with the condenser microphone and a resistor in series so that the change
[00:01:03.680 → 00:01:09.840] in capacitance of the microphone is translated to change in voltage at this point.
[00:01:09.840 → 00:01:15.780] One terminal of the 3.3kohm resistor is connected to negative rail and the other terminal is
[00:01:15.780 → 00:01:21.360] connected to negative of condenser microphone which is the pin connected to outer casing.
[00:01:21.360 → 00:01:25.720] And the positive terminal of the microphone is connected to the positive rail.
[00:01:25.720 → 00:01:30.720] The voltage at this point is normally near positive voltage but it drops whenever there
[00:01:30.720 → 00:01:32.960] is a sudden loud sound around the microphone.
[00:01:32.960 → 00:01:39.520] We'll try to amplify this response by using BC547 and NPN transistor.
[00:01:39.520 → 00:01:45.360] So connect this point to the base of BC547 which is at pin 2 and the emitter which is at pin
[00:01:45.360 → 00:01:49.120] 3 should be connected to negative rail.
[00:01:49.120 → 00:01:53.260] Connect a resistor between positive rail and the collector of transistor.
[00:01:53.260 → 00:01:57.380] This resistor acts as a dummy load which keeps the collector base junction in reverse
[00:01:57.380 → 00:02:02.740] bias and that's required for making the transistor amplify the input signal.
[00:02:02.740 → 00:02:08.420] And because this resistance determines the voltage at the output, its value determines the sensitivity
[00:02:08.420 → 00:02:10.820] and is dependent on the supply voltage.
[00:02:10.820 → 00:02:15.740] So if you are using a 5 or 6 volts of power supply, use a 270 ohm resistor.
[00:02:15.740 → 00:02:21.540] 470 ohm for 9 volts and 1 kilo ohm for 12 volts of power supply.
[00:02:21.540 → 00:02:25.300] Increasing this resistance value reduces the sensitivity.
[00:02:25.300 → 00:02:30.460] Now this is not required but if you place an LED between the output and negative rail, the
[00:02:30.460 → 00:02:34.860] LED glows when you tap or blow air on the microphone.
[00:02:34.860 → 00:02:38.300] But the output is not high enough to detect claps.
[00:02:38.300 → 00:02:43.720] So we will use another NPN transistor and connect the output of the first transistor to the base
[00:02:43.720 → 00:02:46.720] of the second transistor BC547.
[00:02:46.720 → 00:02:50.800] Like you did for the first transistor, connect the emitter of the second transistor to negative
[00:02:50.800 → 00:02:55.280] rail and the collector to load.
[00:02:55.280 → 00:02:59.220] At this moment we will be using an LED as a load to test the circuit.
[00:02:59.220 → 00:03:03.720] So I have connected the collector of second transistor to negative terminal of the LED and
[00:03:03.720 → 00:03:08.480] the positive of LED connects to positive rail via a 270 ohm resistor.
[00:03:08.480 → 00:03:13.440] This resistor should be 470 ohms for 9 or 12 volts of power supply.
[00:03:13.440 → 00:03:14.760] Now turn on the power supply.
[00:03:14.760 → 00:03:19.780] Normally the LED should stay off and it should turn on when you clap or do finger snaps near
[00:03:19.780 → 00:03:22.240] the condenser microphone.
[00:03:22.240 → 00:03:25.420] Or even if you tap or blow air on it.
[00:03:25.420 → 00:03:28.160] Don't panic if the LED always stays on.
[00:03:28.160 → 00:03:33.280] All you need to do is increase the load resistance of the first transistor.
[00:03:33.280 → 00:03:38.400] For example if you are using a 270 ohm resistor, replace it with a higher one, say 330 ohm resistor
[00:03:38.400 → 00:03:42.960] and keep increasing until the LED just turns off.
[00:03:42.960 → 00:03:47.220] I advise you to purchase at least 3 resistors and start from the minimum.
[00:03:47.220 → 00:03:52.600] If the LED stays on, you will use the next resistor and so on.
[00:03:52.600 → 00:03:57.900] Coming back to the main circuit, even though it turns on LED with a clap, it stays on only
[00:03:57.900 → 00:04:02.720] for a moment and normally we would want to increase that duration.
[00:04:02.720 → 00:04:07.880] And obviously a 555 timer in mono stable mode is the best candidate for doing that.
[00:04:07.880 → 00:04:13.820] What this arrangement does is, whenever the trigger pin detects a drop in voltage, the
[00:04:13.820 → 00:04:19.340] 555 timer turns on the output for a duration determined by the value of capacitor and resistor.
[00:04:19.340 → 00:04:24.540] We will first build this mono stable circuit and then couple the trigger pin with the output
[00:04:24.540 → 00:04:27.240] of a primary circuit.
[00:04:27.240 → 00:04:30.580] So let's place the 555 timer IC on the breadboard.
[00:04:30.580 → 00:04:34.880] Connect the pins 6 and 7 and pins 4 and 8.
[00:04:34.880 → 00:04:39.820] Now connect a 100k ohm resistor between the pins 7 and 8.
[00:04:39.820 → 00:04:44.980] Next goes the capacitor with its positive terminal connected to pin 6 and its negative terminal
[00:04:44.980 → 00:04:47.600] connected to negative rail.
[00:04:47.600 → 00:04:51.600] You can choose the capacitor's value depending on the amount of time you require the LED to
[00:04:51.600 → 00:04:53.380] stay on.
[00:04:53.380 → 00:04:59.320] Now connect the output of 555 timer which is at pin 3 to the positive of the LED and the
[00:04:59.320 → 00:05:03.840] negative of the LED to negative rail via a 270 ohm resistor.
[00:05:03.840 → 00:05:07.380] Connect pin 1 to negative rail and pin 4 to positive rail.
[00:05:07.380 → 00:05:12.380] You can now test this mono stable circuit by applying 0V at the trigger pin.
[00:05:12.380 → 00:05:22.320] Now it's time to couple output of a primary circuit with the trigger pin of this mono stable circuit.
[00:05:22.320 → 00:05:27.240] As we don't require LED at the output of a primary circuit, I am removing it along with
[00:05:27.240 → 00:05:31.920] its series resistor.
[00:05:31.920 → 00:05:37.040] Place a 1k ohm resistor between the collector of second transistor and positive rail.
[00:05:37.040 → 00:05:42.600] This resistor acts as a load for the second transistor as well as keeps the output high when the
[00:05:42.600 → 00:05:44.700] transistor is not turned on.
[00:05:44.700 → 00:05:50.600] After this, use a 100nF capacitor to couple the output of the second transistor to the trigger
[00:05:50.600 → 00:05:53.120] pin of 555 timer ILC.
[00:05:53.120 → 00:05:58.160] The capacitor acts as a filter and prevents continuous loud sounds from triggering the monostable
[00:05:58.160 → 00:05:59.200] circuit.
[00:05:59.200 → 00:06:04.200] So normally the voltage at the trigger pin will be near to positive voltage and it drops whenever
[00:06:04.200 → 00:06:09.500] you clap which triggers the monostable circuit and so the LED should glow.
[00:06:09.500 → 00:06:18.820] Finally connect the power supply and here you go, the clap switch or sound triggered LED.
[00:06:18.820 → 00:06:21.520] Thanks for your time, do subscribe and have fun.
