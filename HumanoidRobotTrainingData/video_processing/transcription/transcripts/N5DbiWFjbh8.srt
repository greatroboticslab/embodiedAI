1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,680
but yeah essentially you're just going to fly your quad line of sight or have it freak out on you

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,120
all right so real quick i just wanted to give a disclaimer that this isn't a betaflight tutorial

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,280
for instance on how to update betaflight or how to set up with your build this is just going off

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,200
of the assumption that you already have that all done and you're just looking to get that perfect

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,680
pid tune or improve your bid or you're just curious on how i tune my builds and another thing to

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,520
mention is that every quad is different so they all require their own unique tune so please don't

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,000
copy my end result and expect it to work flawlessly with your build so with that out of the way

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,680
essentially you're gonna need three different softwares first being betaflight configurator

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,800
obviously then black box explorer and then pid toolbox i'll have links to all these in the

10
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,360
description but for the betaflight configurator make sure it's on the latest release at the time of this

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,120
recording it's 10.9 essentially you're just going to scroll down to these download links um i have

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,160
windows so i would just do win64 but i already have it downloaded so i'm not going to save it same thing

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,360
for black box explorer you just scroll down click the download link and then for pid toolbox you're

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:10,560
going to go over here under releases and then just scroll down and download it for years this uh pid

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,280
toolbox software it can be kind of finicky to install it takes a minute it's got to install some other

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,360
things but and sometimes if you create a shortcut on your desktop for example like this there's a chance

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,920
that it won't load if the application isn't launching after you installed it what you want to do

18
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:38,160
is right click open file location and then um open it from here and this should work if that happens

19
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,720
now that you have all these softwares downloaded obviously open up betaflight assuming you already

20
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,920
have updated your quad the latest release of betaflight 4.4 you probably can follow along if

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,920
you're using 4.3 i would recommend updating the 4.4 they improved uh some dynamic notch filtering and

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,760
anti-gravity they also supposedly improved that so heading over to the pid tuning um these numbers

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,240
are going to be different from yours essentially i just applied the express lrs preset at 500 hertz so

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,160
yeah after i applied that preset that's what changed these numbers so just make sure you already have your

25
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
right control preset like i said in the beginning this is going off the assumption you already know how

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,000
to work with betaflight you just want that perfect pit tune next i go to dynamic damping i actually

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,760
change this value from 37 to 40. and then another thing dynamic idle i enable this and i like to set

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,640
it to 25 that fits my props i run a 3.5 degree pitch if you have like a three degree pitch such as the

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,640
ethics pb and j's or gempan 3s i would suggest maybe send that to 30 or if you have a steeply pitched prop

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:45,040
like ethics p4s or like a four degree pitch then i would set this to 20. but for my case i'm going to

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,480
have it set to 25 just click enter and as far as for the rest of these that's pretty much how i leave

32
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,520
it for all my builds all right so with that out of the way go ahead and head over to the black box tab

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,640
make sure you erase any remaining storage you have so with that being done make sure you just select

34
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,680
the right settings for your specific setup usually it's just onboard flash for logging device to have

35
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,840
it minimum two kilohertz and then for the debug i don't think you need it but i just like to set it to

36
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,640
gyro underscore scale that could help with the filtering we're gonna have to view later but

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,000
save and reboot so now that you have your black box settings in go ahead and head back over to the

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,120
pit tuning tab first of all you're going to turn off feet forward then you're going to turn off dynamic

39
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,800
damping and then you're going to turn off your eye gains essentially you're just going to be finding

40
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:35,680
the pd balance and in order to do that you want to take your dampening slider and just bring it down to

41
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,680
0.6 and essentially you're going to fly your quad line of sight for about 30 seconds to a

42
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,960
minute land it and then bring this value up to 0.8 do the same exact thing and just go up essentially

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:52,640
in the increments of 0.2 so next would be one 1.2 and then even as high as 1.4 and what you're going

44
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
to do while you're flying line of sight is you're going to be moving your pitch and roll axis

45
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,960
essentially like in circles like if you just follow my mouse just move your stick like this or just up

46
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,000
and down like crazy or left to right like crazy all for about 30 seconds to a minute like i said before

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,600
another thing to mention probably self-explanatory but make sure your quad is uh set up exactly how you fly it

48
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,240
like if you fly with a gopro make sure the gopro is on if you fly if you tend to crash a lot you might

49
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,800
want to put on damage props these ones are somewhat damaged i don't know how well the gopro can pick it

50
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,360
up but yeah essentially however you fly it out like in the field or at the bando set it up to exactly how

51
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
how you black box it

52
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,040
and that's how you know you do your answer to your hop now that you have all those tests completed

53
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:12,720
go ahead and plug your quad back in head over to black box and then activate mass storage device mode

54
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
and what you're going to do is save all these files except for this beta flight underscore all

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,640
once that's completed go ahead and unplug your quad and plug it back in

56
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:32,800
head back over to beta fleet go over to black box and erase flash and you might as well just go

57
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,920
ahead and minimize beta flight so now we're going to be working with pid toolbox so go ahead and open

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,680
that up now that pid toolbox is open simply select the select button right here and locate your black

59
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:53,760
box files in my case it'd be in stuff drone black box siren of five and i have two files another thing too

60
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:59,600
a lot of uh youtubers or other people attuned say to unplug the battery between each flight but i don't

61
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,480
do that and it works perfectly fine i know probably going to start some controversy in the comments let

62
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:13,360
me know how wrong i am but i mean it works for me at the end of the day so as you can see this first log

63
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,880
had two flights on it so i'm just gonna select them both and then these were the other two logs i did

64
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,200
and this one right here this is where i had too high of d gains so that's why it's only six seconds

65
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,440
and there's no point of selecting that after this all loads what you want to do is come over here to

66
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,440
the step response tool highlight all of these and then click y correction and as you can see this is

67
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,360
the data from uh this these values right here represent 0.6 this represents 0.8 1 and then 1.2

68
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,440
and based off of these lines it looks like 0.8 it is so now we head over we head back over into beta flight

69
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,680
plug or quad in

70
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:09,360
and 0.8 was my best result so put that there save all right so real quick i just wanted to explain how

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,280
these lines should look ideally so right here is like a perfect example you want the line to slightly

72
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,440
overshoot and then get back right on uh to this center point so this right here is actually perfect

73
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,280
the lighter red value on the pitch axis though it's actually slightly under damped so with that being the

74
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:34,160
case i'm actually going to head over to the pit to me and for pitch dampening i lowered it down to 0.95

75
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,800
because it's just very subtle yeah like it's almost perfect just slightly under damped you want it to

76
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,640
look like this light red line if i just click reset run that like this just right onto there maybe a

77
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,480
little overshoot yes this is perfect this is almost perfect all right next step we're going to be

78
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,680
messing with the master multiplier now this might also start up some controversy but just hear me out

79
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,720
on this if you are running a fast controlling such as express rs ghost or tracer as in you're running a

80
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,120
high packet rate uh basically that creates a noisy signal so when you have a noisy signal you need to

81
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,240
filter it out more so what i'm getting at is that if you are running one of those fast control links

82
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,120
your master multiplier is going to be lower than someone who's running a slower control link such as

83
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:31,440
crossfire like the dji transmitter so i have been able to get my quads up to 1.4 but i like to play it on

84
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,400
the safe side so i'm guessing it's going to get up to like 1.3 or 1.2 um hopefully this doesn't come

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,880
across as confusing but if you have a fast control link i would go up in increments of 0.1 if you have

86
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,160
a slower controlling i would go up in increments of 0.2 so you might be asking what's the limit that i

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,400
should take this slider to and honestly after every time you land i would feel the motors and once they

88
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:02,560
start feeling just a little bit uh too hot that's probably a good place to stop or if you start

89
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
hearing flutter obviously or if you start hearing a raining noise that would be a good place to stop

90
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,080
and usually about the 1.6 area and above that's when those uh instances will occur that just all

91
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:34,480
depends on your control link and how well your quad is built now that we're done logging those files i

92
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,160
actually went up to 1.5 on the master multiplier before things started going haywire okay so now

93
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,320
you're going to notice that the line is starting to get a little more swiggly this is completely

94
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,200
fine this is what happens when you turn up pids everything gets more precise and any little

95
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,440
imperfections really start to show don't be too worried all right so now that all these black box

96
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:03,920
logs are loaded this is one point or this is where the master multiplier is at 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 and 1.5

97
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,800
over here is your latency your your pid latency and as you can see the more we moved up the master

98
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,360
multiplier the less latency we had yours will probably vary usually it's like a curve that goes down

99
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,880
steeply and then kind of levels out somewhere mine's still like a linear curve which is kind of ironic

100
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:28,160
i've never seen that before but uh knowing based off of my experience i'm gonna leave the master multiplier

101
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:37,680
at 1.4 so this green value right here let's just reset this and this is the one we're going to go with

102
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,600
and now this is over damped but these values are actually looking good and i when we implement feet

103
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:51,120
forward um and i term this should actually go back up so i'm not too worried all right so heading back

104
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,240
over in the beta flight let's just move this down to 1.4 save now we're going to start implementing i term

105
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:08,800
back again so i like to start this at 0.8 and just go up in increments of 0.1 so next would be 0.9 1 1.1

106
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,720
and 1.2 usually one as the default has always worked but just to be on the safe side just start lower and

107
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:33,520
increase oh so interesting we have what this means right here is oscillation so what that means most

108
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:40,720
likely is that my master multiplier is too high so i'm actually going to decrease this from 1.4 down to 1.3

109
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:51,600
save that okay so it's actually looking identical from 1 all the way up to 1.2 but honestly i'm just

110
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,320
going to leave it at the default value the i term slider that should be good

111
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:07,280
yeah the pitch looks absolutely beautiful um we just have some oscillations on the roll axis all right

112
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,880
next we have feet forward now feet forward we're going to be tuning that not using pid toolbox but

113
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,240
rather the black box explorer itself um i like to start this off at not dynamic david i like to start

114
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:29,280
feet forward off at uh 0.6 and just go up in increments of 0.2 so 0.8 1 1.2 and 1.4 and another

115
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,520
thing to mention about feet forward this is when you're gonna have to start doing flippy flops

116
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,720
so if you've been flying in angle mode um you could do rapid stick movements that might be able to

117
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:53,120
work but doing flips and rolls on both the pitch and roll access will be the best way to tune this

118
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:06,960
all right now instead of opening up this file in pid toolbox we're just going to open it up in the

119
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:12,080
regular black box explorer and if you don't have this chart what you want to do is go to graph setup

120
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:18,880
and add in the access label gyro plus pid roll and then the access label gyro plus pid pitch you

121
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,440
usually go here and then right here and right there so what we are looking for this is going to

122
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:33,360
be the first log second log third fourth fifth let's go for one of these so essentially we're looking

123
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,960
at this red line which is the p term we want this to be as flat as possible because we want the feet

124
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,320
forward this purple line doing all the work so right here you can see the p term is actually pulling

125
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,960
against uh the feet forward which is kind of surprising with the slider being so low i'll have

126
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,400
to look at the other results but yes right here for example on the pitch you can see the p term is

127
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:03,760
actually helping the feet forward that means that feet forward is too low so if we go to another example

128
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,760
same here p term is helping like i said before you want this red line to be as flat as possible with

129
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,640
this because feet forward needs to do all the work so it looks like in my case feet forward is best

130
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,120
going to be left at one on the slider as you can see this is resisting or p term is resisting the

131
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:28,000
feet forward but at the same time it actually catches up at the end i noticed on pitch this is actually as

132
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,320
flat as i can get it other sliders were this is 1.2 and this is 1.4 on the feet forward slider

133
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,200
these were like way too overdone um so yeah feet forward one it is

134
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,720
now that we have feet forward out of the way the final step will be dynamic dampening and honestly

135
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,360
i'm not too much of an expert on how to properly tune this but i basically just go off of how far

136
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,640
i pushed the master multiplier for example i pushed it all the way up to 1.5 1.6 is where the quad started

137
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,840
having issues and then i'll look at the d term here and be like all right this is 35 and 38

138
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,960
bring this back down to 1.3 and then push this up until these values match 35 and 38. so in my case

139
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,920
it would be 0.45 now this is the point where you're going to want to go fly a full pack um preferably

140
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,160
with the goggles on as you would normally push your quad to the limits get the get all the prop wash out

141
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,600
test the anti-gravity by giving it throttle blips and make sure your black box is good to go have

142
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,120
it set to gyro scaled so you can view your filtering and yeah that's basically it we covered

143
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,240
everything and for this specific build this is the tune we ended up with just before i showed the flight

144
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,520
footage i thought i would show you guys um the pid toolbox results at the end as you can see our

145
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,960
latency is extremely low now that everything's implemented and these lines are pretty much almost

146
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:59,840
perfect we could somewhat tweak this to make it even better but i'm happy with these results

147
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,720
another thing too these are the black box logs keep in mind this is a two minute flight so the

148
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,360
longer you fly the more noisy these graphs are going to look i just wanted to show you guys this just to

149
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,360
show like how good of a frame quad mullet is like there's especially for being a two minute flight

150
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,200
there's just barely any noise on these graphs and then heading over to pitch we'll do frequency versus

151
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:30,480
throttle and the reason i have a throttle cap set to 96 just at my motor kb at 1750 instead of 1850.

152
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,360
so yeah i really appreciate you for sticking to the end if you have any feedback or criticism

153
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,760
uh let me know in the comments i'm very open to it this is just specifically how i tune it could be

154
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,920
right it could be wrong everyone tunes different but hopefully you learned a few things and again

155
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:57,200
thank you for watching and here's the flight

156
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
oh

157
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:32,880
eh

158
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,080
WOOOOOOO

159
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,920
WOOOOOOO

160
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,580
boarding

161
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,740
AST

162
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,320
if the

163
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,660
funded

164
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,580

165
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,000
