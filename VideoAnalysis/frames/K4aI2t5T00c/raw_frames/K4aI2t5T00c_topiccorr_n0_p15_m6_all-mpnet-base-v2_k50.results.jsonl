This is also a basic circuit you can purchase online fairly cheap and I believe they have soldering kits to build your own. From what I have read you can add a pair of PNP and NPN output transistors to increase current and reduce the load impedanceI n on this. In Summary I would have to say that I would rank How to make a simple LED flasher as my first video, that is something I want to add to project 2 but using a led to show power doing to the amplifier. The second video would be How to make a laser security alarm, I actually have always wanted to build one just to try, but I think I will try to make one with more of a range to it. My Third pick will be setting up MyDaq as that is very useful and I know that I will need that in the future. My fourth pick will be Mosfets and how to use them, I know that I will need to study this much more for the next exam and this will be a good review video. My fifth video will be Make all component Tester using BC547. I know this can be accomplished by just using a multimeter, but It will help me understand the components of the multimeter better. Number six video will be 3 mind blowing mosfet project, as I can review this often to get a better understanding of what we are studying now in chapter 5 that will most likely me part of the next exam. Video number seven will be Clap Switch circuit on Breadboard (Sound triggered LED) | Transistor + 555 timer projects. This is something I have always wanted to make time to build also, the 555 timer is fascinating to me and I do not have much experience with it. My number eight video will be Basic 4-Transistor MOSFET H-Bridge, as I stated earlier I think this could be very useful if I want to build my own little robot to control the motors, and it was a much simpler method of motor control than anything that I have seen before. Number nine video pick will be how to make simple dc motor speed control circuit, because this goes along with number eight video on how to control motors on a more simple method. I feel like this would be a huge part of small robot arm building that could be simplified but still managed to be controlled smoothly. Finally my number ten pick, the top ten video will have to be the Opto-Couplers Theory and Circuits. I have to say this was very interesting on not only protecting the circuit by using the light to control the switching in the circuit. I feel this would be very useful in many circuits with great precision to control the correct amount of voltage in a certain range. All of the videos are very informative and I enjoyed watching them.
