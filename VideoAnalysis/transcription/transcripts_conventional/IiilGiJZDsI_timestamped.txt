[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:10.800] The classes that we are going to talk about in this course are not only used in power amplifiers,
[00:00:10.800 → 00:00:17.280] but also used in audio amplifier circuits. The first class that we are going to examine is
[00:00:17.280 → 00:00:22.800] Class A Amplifier. This amplifier circuit must look familiar to you because this configuration
[00:00:22.800 → 00:00:27.240] is nothing else but the common emitter circuit amplifier. So we already talked about this
[00:00:27.240 → 00:00:34.200] circuit and we have also seen how to design one. So let's just point out some facts about this configuration.
[00:00:35.080 → 00:00:41.640] Okay, so Class A Amplifier is a high gain amplifier with high linearity. In case of Class A Amplifier,
[00:00:41.640 → 00:00:50.120] the conduction angle is 360 degree. As I explained in the previous course, a 360 degree conduction angle
[00:00:50.120 → 00:00:56.520] means that the amplifier device remains active for the entire time and use complete input signal.
[00:00:57.480 → 00:01:02.920] As we can see in this image, there is only one active element which is nothing else but the transistor.
[00:01:02.920 → 00:01:09.160] So the bias of the transistor remains on all the time, right? Due to this never turn off feature,
[00:01:09.160 → 00:01:14.120] Class A Amplifier provides better high frequency and feedback loop stability.
[00:01:15.160 → 00:01:21.480] Other than disadvantages, Class A Amplifier is easy to construct with a single device component
[00:01:21.480 → 00:01:30.040] and minimum parts count. Despite the advantages and high linearity, certainly it has many limitations.
[00:01:30.040 → 00:01:35.800] Due to continuous conduction nature, the Class A Amplifier introduce high power loss.
[00:01:36.520 → 00:01:44.520] Also due to high linearity, Class A Amplifier provides distortion and noises. The power supply and the BIOS
[00:01:44.520 → 00:01:51.400] construction needs careful component selection to avoid unwanted noise and to minimize the distortion.
[00:01:52.680 → 00:01:57.560] So we mentioned that Class A Amplifier has high power loss, right? This means that it emits
[00:01:57.560 → 00:02:02.280] heat and requires heat sink space, which sometimes is not available.
[00:02:03.240 → 00:02:10.120] The efficiency is very poor in Class A Amplifiers. Theoretically, the efficiency varies between 25%
[00:02:10.120 → 00:02:17.880] to 30% if used with the usual configuration. The efficiency can be improved using inductively coupled
[00:02:17.880 → 00:02:25.800] configuration but the efficiency in such case is not more than 40% or 50% due to it is only suitable for
[00:02:25.800 → 00:02:33.320] low signal or low power level amplification purposes. Now that we highlighted some important facts about
[00:02:33.320 → 00:02:35.960] this class, let's move to Class B.
[00:02:35.960 → 00:02:44.280] The Class B Amplifier is a bit different from the Class A as you can see here. It is created using two
[00:02:44.280 → 00:02:51.720] active devices which conduct half of the actual cycle, in other words they conduct 180 degree of the cycle.
[00:02:52.840 → 00:02:59.000] So two devices provide combined current drive for the load. If the circuit is used to provide audio
[00:02:59.000 → 00:03:05.240] signal amplification, then the load is nothing else but a speaker, right? You might wonder how are these
[00:03:05.240 → 00:03:11.080] transistors biased? Well, the bias is provided by the input signal, which means that the input signal
[00:03:11.080 → 00:03:19.080] has to be higher than 0.6V and also the input signal has to go negative in order to bias the PMP
[00:03:19.080 → 00:03:24.520] transistor. Don't worry if you don't understand how this circuit works because in the next course we
[00:03:24.520 → 00:03:31.800] try to simulate some of the classes so that you get a better understanding of how they work. Now let's just
[00:03:31.800 → 00:03:37.240] concentrate on theory a little bit and don't bother yourself if you don't understand exactly how the
[00:03:37.240 → 00:03:45.320] circuit works. So this Class B amplifier consists of two active devices which get biased one by one
[00:03:45.320 → 00:03:52.280] during the positive and negative half cycle of the sinusoidal wave and thus the signal gets pushed or
[00:03:52.280 → 00:03:59.560] pulled to the amplified level from both positive and negative side. And by combining the result we get
[00:03:59.560 → 00:04:07.400] complete cycle across the output. Because these two active devices are turned on one after another and
[00:04:07.400 → 00:04:14.040] because they conduct only half cycle the efficiency gets improved. Compared to the efficiency of a Class A
[00:04:14.040 → 00:04:23.240] amplifier which is 25 to 30 percent, the Class B amplifier can have an efficiency more than 60 percent. Also,
[00:04:23.240 → 00:04:30.040] the heat dissipation is minimized in this class providing a low heat sink space. But this Class also
[00:04:30.040 → 00:04:37.320] have limitations. A very profound limitation of this Class is the crossover distortion. As two devices
[00:04:37.320 → 00:04:43.800] provides each half of the sinusoidal waves which are combined and joined across the output, there's a
[00:04:43.800 → 00:04:51.240] mismatch, in other words crossover in the region where two halves are combined. This is because when one
[00:04:51.240 → 00:04:57.320] device completes the half cycle, the other one needs to provide the same power almost at the same time
[00:04:57.320 → 00:05:04.120] when other one finishes the job. It is difficult to fix this error in a Class B amplifier as during the
[00:05:04.120 → 00:05:10.680] active device the other device remains completely inactive. The error provides a distortion in the
[00:05:10.680 → 00:05:17.960] output signal and due to this limitation it is a major fail for precision audio amplifier applications.
[00:05:17.960 → 00:05:29.480] An alternate approach to overcome the crossover distortion is to use the AB amplifier. Class AB
[00:05:29.480 → 00:05:36.440] amplifier uses intermediate conduction angle of both Classes A and B, thus we can see the property of
[00:05:36.440 → 00:05:44.200] both Class A and Class B amplifier in this AB class of amplifier topology. Same as Class B, it has the same
[00:05:44.200 → 00:05:51.240] configuration with two active devices which conducts during half of the cycles individually, but each
[00:05:51.240 → 00:05:59.000] device bias differently so they do not get completely off during the unusable moment or the crossover moment.
[00:05:59.960 → 00:06:06.680] Each device does not leave the conduction immediately after completing the half of the sinusoidal waveform,
[00:06:06.680 → 00:06:12.840] instead they conduct a small amount of input on another half cycle. Using this biasing technique,
[00:06:12.840 → 00:06:20.200] the crossover mismatch during the dead zone is dramatically reduced. But in this configuration,
[00:06:20.200 → 00:06:26.840] efficiency is reduced as the linearity of the devices is compromised. The efficiency remains more
[00:06:26.840 → 00:06:32.200] than the efficiency of typical Class A amplifier, but it is less than the Class B amplifier system.
[00:06:33.080 → 00:06:39.800] Also, the diodes need to be carefully chosen with the exact same rating and need to be placed as close
[00:06:39.800 → 00:06:46.440] as possible to the output device. In some circuit construction, designers tend to add small value
[00:06:46.440 → 00:06:52.760] resistors to provide stable quiescent current across the device to minimize the distortion across the output.
[00:06:54.840 → 00:07:03.720] Apart from the Class A, B and AB amplifier, there is another amplifier called Class C. It's a traditional
[00:07:03.720 → 00:07:07.640] amplifier which works differently than the other amplifier's classes.
[00:07:07.640 → 00:07:14.600] Class C amplifier is a tuned amplifier which works in two different operation modes, tuned or untuned.
[00:07:15.560 → 00:07:25.320] The efficiency of Class C amplifier is much more than the A, B and AB, so a maximum 80% efficiency can be achieved in
[00:07:25.320 → 00:07:33.800] radio-frequency related operations. The interesting thing here is that Class C amplifier uses less than 180 degree
[00:07:33.800 → 00:07:43.320] conduction angle. And during the untuned mode, the Class C amplifier unfortunately gives huge distortion across the output.
[00:07:44.440 → 00:07:51.080] But in typical uses, Class C amplifier gives 60 to 70% efficiency.
[00:07:51.080 → 00:08:01.720] The output amplitude is a non-linear function of the input, so Class C amplifier is not used for linear amplification.
[00:08:01.720 → 00:08:10.920] They are generally used in radio-frequency applications including circuits such as oscillators that have a constant output amplitude
[00:08:10.920 → 00:08:16.200] and modulators where a high-frequency signal is controlled by a low-frequency signal.
[00:08:17.240 → 00:08:24.920] So, it works fine with a simple sinusoidal waveform, but may have unacceptable distortion with complex waveform,
[00:08:24.920 → 00:08:31.560] as the Class C amplifier the transistor conducts for less than 180 degree of the input signal.
[00:08:31.560 → 00:08:38.760] So, on the other hand, Class D amplifiers are way more popular and wider spread as Class C amplifiers.
[00:08:38.760 → 00:08:45.960] It's one of my favorite in terms of functionality, and we will also try to simulate this circuit in our simulator in the next course.
[00:08:46.600 → 00:08:55.880] While Class A, B and AB are classified as analog designs, Class D amplifiers are classified as switching designs.
[00:08:55.880 → 00:08:59.080] As you can see, the circuit is very different from the others.
[00:08:59.080 → 00:09:06.840] This is just a semi-block diagram of a Class D amplifier, but in the next course we will see a full functional circuit.
[00:09:07.880 → 00:09:13.080] So, Class D amplifier is a switching amplifier which uses pulse-width modulation.
[00:09:13.800 → 00:09:18.600] If you are wondering what pulse-width modulation is, I advise you to look that up on the internet
[00:09:18.600 → 00:09:21.240] because it's a very important technique used in electronics.
[00:09:21.800 → 00:09:29.000] Basically, pulse-width modulation, or PVM, is a technique for getting analog results with digital
[00:09:29.000 → 00:09:29.720] signal means.
[00:09:29.720 → 00:09:36.760] So, digital control is used to create a square wave, which is a signal switched between ON and OFF, right?
[00:09:37.240 → 00:09:45.800] As the name implies, the width of the square waves are modified in order to vary the amount of current that flows to a device.
[00:09:47.000 → 00:09:55.160] Alright, so the conduction angle is not a factor in such case as the direct input signal is changed with a variable pulse-width.
[00:09:55.880 → 00:10:02.440] In this class D amplifier system, the linear gain is not accepted as they work just like a typical switch,
[00:10:02.440 → 00:10:05.720] which have only two operations, ON or OFF.
[00:10:06.840 → 00:10:13.000] Before processing the input signal, the analog signal is converted into a pulse stream by various modulation
[00:10:13.000 → 00:10:17.080] techniques, and then it is applied to the amplifier system.
[00:10:17.080 → 00:10:26.360] As the pulse's duration is related with the analog signal, it is again reconstructed using low-pass filter across the output.
[00:10:27.080 → 00:10:31.640] Remember that class D amplifier is the highest power-efficient amplifier class.
[00:10:32.200 → 00:10:37.080] So, it has smaller heat dissipation, so small heat sink is needed.
[00:10:37.080 → 00:10:43.880] The circuit requires various switching components like MOSFETs, which has low ON resistance.
[00:10:44.600 → 00:10:50.120] It is widely used apology in digital audio players or controlling the motors as well.
[00:10:50.680 → 00:10:54.920] But we should keep in mind that it is not a digital converter.
[00:10:54.920 → 00:10:57.640] Mix in impeachment.
[00:10:57.640 → 00:11:00.920] I would say that it is not only about 100% of its product, but there are two- cheer cases still
[00:11:01.640 → 00:11:04.360] in the past, you can easily control it too!
[00:11:05.040 → 00:11:08.600] That theieron powders will not occur
[00:11:08.600 → 00:11:12.100] So over time Pharaoh is verified, that as theず quasi-dرب of the associate and trabal parades of the
[00:11:12.100 → 00:11:13.720] ature, etmude the other than the level.
[00:11:13.720 → 00:11:15.720] Then because the definitivian describes a different has to be destroyed.
[00:11:15.720 → 00:11:17.840] But then they do have a good sense of the pressure of the clairement track track.
[00:11:17.840 → 00:11:18.900] And while we learn so that the faktor, let's go back and further colonize from everywhere I wouldn't
[00:11:18.900 → 00:11:19.960] happen.
[00:11:19.960 → 00:11:20.400] And while they approach this pewter, this thing that pops up
