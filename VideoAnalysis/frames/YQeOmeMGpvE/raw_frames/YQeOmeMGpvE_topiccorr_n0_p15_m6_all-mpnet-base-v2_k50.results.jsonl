The video, supported by Vaunt, also provided practical insights into selecting cost-efficient GPS modules like the HLRC M80 and their integration with the drone's flight controller. It included a meticulous step-by-step guide for setting up and configuring GPS in Betaflight, ensuring optimal performance through correct wiring and voltage supply. Additionally, the tutorial covered advanced settings such as failsafe parameters and on- screen display elements, reinforcing the importance of thorough testing protocols for safe drone operation.
