Email query processing

Answer: Image Recognition, as it is addressed by ML/AI, not RPA. RPA could be used to automate an image recognition system, though.

option C - I amge processing, it requires AI and ML

Image recognition

C: Image processing

The answer is c Image processing . It's quite dificult to extract images since it contains different gray levels and different colours and textures . AND this video is very helpful . Thank you @simplilearn :)

Image recognition

In relation to data extraction i.e., similar to the first example where the candidate is manually copying and pasting information in to excel or a similar program. Does anyone know of any already existing programs or software to streamline this process?

It's option C " Image Recognition".

A mi parecer en la opción C, Image Recognition, no se podría usar un RPA (por el momento)

Image recognition

Very true to say simple learn awesome …… it’s applicable to all the 4 fields of data processing

hello sir can I borrow some of your information for school purposes only?

Image recorgnisation

Very amazing explanation by breaking down into simple concept. But how will you recognise 3 lucky winner for Amazon gift voucher :) . I think its C: Image recognition as you said RPA does not have its own intelligence to do task of its own neither it can replace human as image recognition is one the example of ML and AI . Hope this helps

RPA is not intelligent. Hyper automation is. Image recognition  💯💯

Option 3 - image recognition I think is not as RPA use case. G

option C

all of them.

We have done all the business use cases you mentioned in the RPA business use cases that you cannot do.  Intelligent automation can be done when you combine RPA with ML.

I think 3. Image recognition is not an RPA use case

Image recognition

my option is D

C

Option c

Image processing is the odd one here

3 image recognition

C. Image recognition

Image recognition is not RPA because it requires the computer to determine what it is looking at while we defined RPA as an AI without much of a brain and cannot think for itself unlike the case for image recognition.

3. Image recognition

Image recognition. Because RPA is for much more repetitive tasks. (Every image may have its own unique characteristics)

Image recognition

Except Image Recognition, all are RPA use cases.

Answer to Question is A

Image processing is not RP

the translations does not match with the video. Please make the corrections. Thank you!

image recognition

Image recognition, I feel so

Image recognition is answer

Thank you for your explanation. It really helped me a lot!! 🙂🙂

Payroll processing is NOT RPA

1. Email query processing. Email queries are best handled by a human. Image recognition can and already has been widely automated.

3.Image Recognition

Option 3

Image recognition, because it is assessing unique data every time

Great overview!  I teach this in several of my accounting courses because accounting has many repetitive tasks that can benefit from RPA.  I plan to share this with students!

Image recognition is not a part of RPA. It involves a different set of frameworks.

Option 1 - RPA can't handle random queries

Image recognition

it can be used in all cases

Option 3 . Image recognition.

Image Recognition

nice overview of RPA. been trying to understand RPA lowkey

C. image Recognition  As there can be new Image every time

Image recognize

Very informative video, really appreciate it.  But it would be better if you guys could also add script or subtitles on.

Misconception about RPA is that it has elements of AI and ML. In fact, ML is a branch of AI, but RPA is fancy word for automation coined by RPA platforms like Uipath and A2019. By the way, Jim is very angry since his job got eaten up by RPA.

useful info...it must be image recognition. Thank you.

3-Imagine Recognition is not an RPA Process

Thank you Simplilearn

Image recongition. As per RPA theory, image recognition is  not a part of this task.

I thought none of the option first, but was a suddenly answer after hearing so much of what RPA can reduce on processing numbers of task, so i went directly to say none but yeah option C or 3 sounds exactly the type of option with more complicated detailed info to process and lot of more stuff to recognize , so yes option C image recognition

Image Recognition is not one of them

Awesome explanation. I was thinking the option C: Image Recognition, but currently Open CV and other similar software can do logical constructs based out of given image. Like whether this is an image of a pet, or if the image is in the desired format, etc. What is your thoughts on this?

Hey simplilearn , thank you for explained it clearly ....  I wanted to know what would be the future of RPA in coming 5 years ????

RPA in future will kill so many jobs... That many will be jobless 🙄

Well, just buy in the first place a program that does it all in one instead of 2 different programs and place a robot in between LoL.

Hi Good Video. The answer for the question is Image Processing. By the way which tool you have used to create this video. Its really nice. Does the tool has option for text to voice conversion?

Image recognition

Option C - Image recognition

you are a ai robot or a real human 🤣🤣🤣

Great info.  Sounds like it would definitely replace workers. A lot of people are paid to do repetitive task and might be too old or disinterested in learning something new. The employers can simply replace some employees to cut time/money. Then that employee is forced into early retirement.

My quiz answer:  All 4 choices are RPA opportunities, there is choice that is not applicable to RPA.

Option C - Image recognition

@SimplilearnOfficial  At 1:17 It says RPA uses AI and ML to handle... But your answer states that Image Recognition uses ML which is part of what RPA uses and in doing so contradicts the video.

Seems like it’d be image recognition option C, based on what you’ve said about extracting data and the limitations of RPA.   Can we run a contest for 2022?

@SimplilearnOfficial   Meanwhile OCR is possible by RPA :)

​ @pritamroy8921  But that would be integration right? Since OCR is already being used world wide more than RPA itself. Maybe in future, RPA evolves so much that it will cover all those basic fuctionalities?

Image Recognition

Very good information on RPA. Short, effective & impressive 👍

I just hope i can remember all this for my interview

Super good. Appreciated!

Answer for the Quiz : E-mail Query Processing.

Image recognition

Email query processing is the answer. As I experienced working in Shared Services environment, there are very complicated customer or client questions or problems that cannot be answered by RPA and still require cognitive thinking. RPA would only be applicable if the queries are simple and repetitive. In Data Extraction, we can use Power BI. In Image recognition we can use OCR or optical character recognition. In Payroll Processing, we can use many systems like prime system.

Image recognition it is not

Image recognition is the closest option though it is also "RPA'ble to an extent". RPA works on pre-set logic and image recognition through OCR need to define all the possible outcomes. However, this is indeed a challenging task unless complemented with AI and machine learning tools.

@Simplilearn also used an automated commenting bot I guess. Haha

All 4 tasks can be done. Because there is an intersection between RPA and Machine learning. Since RPA is just a bunch of workflows, the machine learning algorithm can be added to the workflow to do a particular task in a process. So I guess it is just a difference in the perception. If you are a data scientist / AI Engineer, then all these 4 can be made into a workflow easily without even thinking about RPA in the first place.

I guess your answer is leaning towards image recognition but there are already ways to do that. RPA is just a middleware that is able to integrate with AI capabilities to achieve that.

A very well short introduction to the RPA industry. Looking forward to more videos describing maybe each competitor with its pros & cons.

In my opinion I think the answer is 3 image recognition.

Hey!  I would like to know if it's possible to use this video as advertising and explaining of RPA for possible customers, we are thinking of opening a RPA software company here in brazil   Thanks!

Thank you. I was just asked to start learning RPA to implement in my area of banking. Image Recognition is likely not a use case as its constantly changing what you are looking for, but depending on the purpose perhaps you could develops a specific algorithm to look for specific facial features for a model agency or something of this sort.

5) None of the above. I don't like this question because its implying that Image recognition is not an RPA use case. A better question would be "which is not the best RPA use case?". RPA with the use of AI/ML can work wonders with unstructured data.

Nowadays, Most companies want to see that candidates for RPA jobs have acquired at least minimal training. Many prefer to hire candidates who have earned certifications in RPA. Getting trained on one or more leading RPA platforms is therefore a good start. So, definitely the scope of RPA jobs are high.

Hi! Yes! Image recognition is more of an Artificial intelligence concept rather than RPA. RPA is primarily used to perform huge manual tasks to lessen the burden on us humans

3RD Option Image recognition is not RPA

Option 3 image recognition

3. Image processing.

RPA can do all those 4 cases. Even in case number 3 Image Recognition, RPA has OCR technology to do that.

all of them are use cases, lots of rpa softwares have image recognition

Image recognition

I think => 4. Payroll processing Cause of RPI can not prerorm critical or logical  thinking as humans do,  and the precessus of payroll needs always critical and human analysing that's why  thank you tream for ur videos

3 image recognition

Image recognition

I would say Image Recognition  Nice video, thank you for this.

Image recognition is not the case of rpa

1.Email  query processing

None, it will perform them all.

RPA can't be deployed to use model building and prediction so it won't work for the case of Image recognition! Therefore answer:Image recognition

Answer is  3)Image recognition

1 - Email query processing

Payroll processing is the answer

IMAGE RECOGNITION  -    answer

All processes in question can be automated with RPA

3 Image recognition Bcz RPA don't hv brain like ai 😂  Thanks for this great section 😍

Image recognition

Image recognition, because it is assessing unique data every time

Image processing

None

How different is it from BPA or BPM?

Rpa can be used in every case. Even in 3. Image recognition. You can use OCR aka Optical Character Recognition to teach your robot see faces, even letters. Ui path uses it I think.

3. Image recognition

@SimplilearnOfficial  well image recognition too can be obtained using Rpa tool like Automation anywhere .. where we can have a image compared with already recognized image.. we can also achieve clicking on the image if available

Hi Scott, we have sent the voucher to your mail ID. Thanks.

Scott Canion  Hahaha. Using fake IDs o Fake Names....

However, by using a 3rd-party vendor, one can attach image recognition technology within a RPA process. UiPath is looking to integrate it into their suite as well, by the use of Computer Vision.

3. Image recognition As RPA doesn't directly use Image Recognition as it might not be feasible but nowadays we use OCR (Optical character recognition) to identify mostly text and numbers in documents

3. Image Processing  As in RPA image processing isn't an easy job it has to use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) which may give inaccurate results hence image processing is the closest answer.

Image Recognition is the answer
