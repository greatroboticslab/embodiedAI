If you already have PLC training, design one with this simulator bundle https://bin95.com/vocational-training/plc-training/siemens/siemens-plc-simulator.htm If you have not yet had PLC training, start here https://bin95.com/vocational-training/plc-training/allen-bradley/allen-bradley-plc-programming.htm
