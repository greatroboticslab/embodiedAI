I guess this is an easier way to do, but it seems a little sloppy to me. It is very interesting to see the control of the motor with very little electronics. The motor is moving pretty fast for only a hand full of electronics used. I do wonder how hot the mosfet was controlling the motor.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvMDlG_AF3Q: how to make simple dc motor speed control circuit"}, {"correlated": false, "score": 0, "reason": "{\n\"correlated\": false,\n\"score\": 0,\n\"reason\": \"The topic is about repetition of 'Let's go' without context or explanation, whereas the comment discusses building a DC motor speed control circuit with specific materials and connections.

In order to assemble the circuit, you start by connecting a wire to the MOSFET. Next you connect the middle pin of the MOSFET to the resistor and the other end of the resistor to the middle pin of the potentiometer. The other pins of the potentiometer can be connected to wires. One will be connected to the MOSFET and the other to the pin will be used to attach the power supply and the multimeter. When all of those connections are made the multimeter will be able to read the voltage going across the circuit. Finally, you can attach the DC motor to the circuit, and it will start spinning due to the correct assembly of the circuit.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvMDlG_AF3Q: how to make simple dc motor speed control circuit."}, {"correlated": false, "score": 20, "reason": "The topic is about repetition of 'Let's go' with no further context or explanation, while the comment discusses building a DC motor with speed control.

It uses a resistor, potentiometer, and DC power source of 25V. This was not really helpful in the class project but it was really cool to watch and see how the simple dc motor can be build with very few components.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvMDlG_AF3Q&t=18s: how to make a simple dc motor speed control circuit."}]}
