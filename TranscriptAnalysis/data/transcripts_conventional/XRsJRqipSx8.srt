00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,360
Hi, this is János, it's RealWorld Audio, and we are back on track with the amplifier

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,880
loudspeaker matching series about that.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:21,880
So basically Zoe Nagy asked a question about Zobell networks, is that can we fix the impedance

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:32,000
issues with Zobell networks and the impedance issues of loudspeakers, because on my previous

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,560
videos in this series I told mostly about impedance problems that when you have with

6
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,900
loudspeakers and can they be fixed with Zobells.

7
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,900
So the response for that is some of it can be fixed.

8
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:53,900
And how is that, so just let me see, does it want to change?

9
00:00:53,900 --> 00:01:03,620
Let me see, yes, it didn't want to change, but it did after all.

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:10,700
So basically this is just, this is not my thing, it's WaveCore's website, and just googled it

11
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,480
up and found something that I can use to share with you.

12
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,300
And they have a nice figures and drawings.

13
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,940
So basically this is how a Zobell network looks like.

14
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:31,480
You have here the driver, your tweeter, or a full range driver, and you add in parallel with

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,800
your driver, resistor and a capacitor combination.

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:46,140
And what it does is that it neutralizes the effect of the Voyeur's coil's self-inductance.

17
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,360
Or actually that's what we want to approximate.

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:57,640
It doesn't actually neutralize that effect, but it is similar, it is complementary to that,

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,200
and that's the net effect that you are seeing.

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
So when you look at the impedance here of the tweeter or full range driver, it looks like

21
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,580
this.

22
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,100
It has a self-resonant frequency.

23
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:14,500
And below that the impedance drops down.

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,920
And above that the impedance drops down.

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,720
And where it drops here, that's the impedance minima of the driver.

26
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,780
And if you divide that by 0.8, then you get the nominal impedance of the loudspeaker that's

27
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,320
using this driver.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,720
And you see that minima, where it is, that's where your driver is happiest working at, and

29
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,040
the least problem-free in operation.

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:54,100
And then the impedance starts to rise because of the self-inductance of the voice coil.

31
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,100
And as it starts to rise, after a while we are going to get into issues.

32
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:06,420
And at the far end the issues will start to get dominated by the inductance of the voice

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,420
coil, which will ultimately limit the high frequency extension of the driver.

34
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:22,660
But before that the problems will start occurring because the wavelength of the sound that the

35
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,840
driver needs to produce is getting too short for the size of the driver to handle.

36
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,900
So those two things are the ones that will ultimately limit the high frequency extension of your driver.

37
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,160
And there's like a plenty of other things going on in the background, like motor strength,

38
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:47,000
if it's not strong enough it cannot produce a clean detail.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:55,380
But what is the distortion of the, or the handling of the membrane of your driver, that's a completely

40
00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:01,420
different question regards to the impedance of it.

41
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:06,540
So that's a different tail for a different day.

42
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,580
So if we put in a Zobell network, that will create something like this.

43
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,140
It won't create a perfect fat line, but it will flatten it out.

44
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,680
And even if you just don't get this harsh rise, it will be nicer.

45
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,420
However, is that solution a universal band-aid?

46
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,840
No, it's not.

47
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:36,180
In the case of an unruly tweeter, so if you have a tweeter that gets really harsh and annoying,

48
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:44,340
or if you get a full range driver speaker and it has really annoying, harsh top end, then

49
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:50,000
using a Zobell is probably your second best bet to improve it.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,920
I would say the first best bet is to use a high quality driver.

51
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,580
If you can't do that, then you have something that has issues.

52
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,460
In that case, just try to use it with a high quality amplifier.

53
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,000
And when you don't have that, so you have a mid-low quality driver with a mid-low quality

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,680
amplifier.

55
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:22,300
That's when you really need the Zobell network, because the drivers by themselves usually are

56
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,560
not that bad.

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:34,000
What makes them sound truly bad and awful and just is the fact that they are driven by compromised

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,220
amplifier.

59
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,280
That's where your problems begin.

60
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:52,580
And when you put a Zobell network there, it not only makes your driver smoother, but it

61
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:59,940
kills off a lot of the harsh distortion coming from your power amplifier.

62
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:06,220
So when you read the comments on my channel, Frank is commenting several times on the hard

63
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,800
distortion.

64
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,280
In French it's the distortion due.

65
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:20,240
So it's like a form of distortion that is perceived as a harsh distortion to the human ear.

66
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:31,060
And it's particularly nasty in the high end and just messes up the frequencies beyond 10 kilohertz

67
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,200
pretty badly.

68
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,200
So when you add the Zobell network and you have a mid-level, mid-to-low level solid state amplifier,

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,080
that will do really wonders.

70
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,420
And even if you have a higher level solid state amplifier, a very high quality Zobell will be

71
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,660
your friend.

72
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,920
And I think Gabor, he has mentioned, he has commented that he is making high quality Zobells

73
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:02,540
and helping people to install them on their speakers.

74
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,980
And everyone is super happy with them.

75
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:14,280
And that's another application note for Zobell networks is that if you have a low level loudspeaker,

76
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:22,100
low level amplification like an LM chip driven amplifier that you built or you bought for very

77
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:29,220
cheap, then it's going to have a lot of hard distortion.

78
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,020
And that hard distortion is the one that you perceive.

79
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,820
That happens with real music.

80
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:39,060
You can measure that same device with your oscilloscope and just a plain sine wave.

81
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,200
And it is, yeah, it measures perfectly the sine wave.

82
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:50,000
It's like measuring a car pilot, a student driver, drive on the test field.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,380
And yeah, he's great, you know, he could turn right, he could turn left.

84
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,380
Then the instructor asked him to brake, yeah, he brake.

85
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,620
He could shift up to gear two, back from gear two to gear one.

86
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,620
Yeah, amazing.

87
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:08,760
But that's very different from driving in heavy traffic.

88
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,620
The two have, as the student, when you are a student driver and you know that you, you

89
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,620
ace the driving course.

90
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,860
And then you go out into heavy traffic on a highway or in a city, that's two completely

91
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
different things.

92
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,860
And even though you felt comfortable, like, you know, like just taking, swerving left and

93
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
right.

94
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,860
But out there it's like, man, it's like, I'm going to survive it.

95
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,860
That's your first thought.

96
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,980
And you will be just a klutz out there.

97
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,000
And what you need to do is have like 10 years of driving experience.

98
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,140
And then you can be on the phone, eat your sandwich, maybe shave at the same time, and

99
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,220
it's still fine, no problem.

100
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:55,960
But what they will measure you is like how you drive on the test course.

101
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,580
And that's what the audio measurements do.

102
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:06,640
And there the amp is not taxed, it's asked to perform basic tasks.

103
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:15,700
And when we ask amplifiers to perform basic tasks into a resistor load, not into a loudspeaker,

104
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,080
into a resistor load, then the solid state amplifiers are doing a phenomenal job.

105
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:28,560
But when they are asked to drive a true loudspeaker, not a resistor, and use true music, then they

106
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:40,460
fare much poorer compared to driving the test course of that resistor with a sine wave.

107
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:46,840
And the tube topology, and I'm not just saying tube topology, but no negative feedback, short

108
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:53,700
path, single-ended topology, the strength of it is driving the real thing.

109
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,100
And when you ask them to drive a test course, they are not that good on that.

110
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,600
And you expect them that because they are mediocre on the test course, in the real life they will

111
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
just totally suck.

112
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,740
But no, it's quite the other way around.

113
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:17,180
And the fact that you look like how much power an amplifier can put into a resistor, and how

114
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,320
much power can it put into a real life loudspeaker?

115
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,780
When you look at solid state amplifiers, they can put out less power into a loudspeaker compared

116
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,680
to what they can put out into a resistor.

117
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,280
So when you read that your amplifier can put out 1000 watts into 2 ohms, that amplifier can

118
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,280
put out 1000 watts into a 2 ohms resistor.

119
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:46,220
So when you look at the 2 ohms loudspeaker load, it can put out less.

120
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:55,680
And when you read that an amp tube amplifier can put out 8 watts into an 8 ohms load, then

121
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,160
how much can it put out into a real loudspeaker?

122
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,960
Well, very few people have done experimentation on that.

123
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,120
AudioNote was one of them.

124
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,860
They have a white paper on their website.

125
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,040
And they used one of their amplifiers driving one of their speakers, and they examined three

126
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,360
different amplifiers.

127
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,260
They used one of their single-handed amps, tube amps with 300b amp.

128
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:26,360
They used a push-pull tube amplifier, and they used a solid state amplifier.

129
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,480
And they compared these three very different topologies.

130
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:36,700
And they noticed that the solid state amplifier put out less than the rated wattage.

131
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:46,160
The push-pull amplifier put out several times the rated wattage into that real loudspeaker.

132
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,540
And they put out 300b amp.

133
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,120
Sorry, 8 watts into that 8 ohms resistor.

134
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,160
Into their loudspeaker put out 80 watts.

135
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,840
10 times the power that it was rated at.

136
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:09,160
So that's why it's very critical that when you are looking at measurements and ratings,

137
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:16,660
you make it clear in your mind that what you lead in the data sheets, in the measurements,

138
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:23,880
how speakers are specified, they're specified with resistors as load, which has absolutely

139
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,000
nothing to do with real life.

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,980
But anyway, I digress.

141
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:33,640
So now let's return back to the subject on hand, the Zobell networks.

142
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,200
So that's why a Zobell network can be your friend, because even though the measurement

143
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:47,460
didn't of a resistor, of a sine wave, didn't tell you anything what your amplifier would

144
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:56,600
do with a loudspeaker with music, but your hearing will confirm you that your Zobell network

145
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,440
is absolutely necessary to clean up the highs.

146
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:09,320
And the problem that it fixes in most cases is not the problem of the rise of the impedance

147
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,160
of the voice coil.

148
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:23,760
Because the rise of the impedance will do its phase shift and will incur a loss of information.

149
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,940
And that loss of information you cannot undo by adding a capacitor resistor network.

150
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,820
It's just going to lose additional bits of information, but in an opposite phase.

151
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:46,440
So the distortion of the two, the kind of distortion, what they do to the sound, they will cancel out

152
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,320
each other.

153
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,620
But the information loss by one and the information loss by the other won't be cancelled out.

154
00:13:54,620 --> 00:14:04,500
So you will have even greater level of information loss when you have the Zobell in place.

155
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:13,180
However, because you have cleaned up so much of the hard distortion of your amplifier's output,

156
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:21,060
in most cases you will experience this as a revelation.

157
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:30,060
Because most of that hard distortion is gone and you are able to hear high frequencies coming out from your loudspeaker.

158
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,940
Which before you have not heard.

159
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Because the hard distortion of your source, of your amplifier was masquerading, was masking the highest frequencies with distortion content.

160
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:53,820
And when I listen to lower level gear, and when you listen to them, and it seems, wow, this sounds really extended in the highs.

161
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:59,320
But when you listen to it, that's not natural, that's not part of the music.

162
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,320
It's the distortion of the amplifier masquerading as high-end.

163
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,040
And when you put on a Zoba, that distortion is cut.

164
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:16,400
But you also notice that the highs, they don't extend anymore that much.

165
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,920
And that's because it's cutting from the information content.

166
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:27,260
So let's try it, if my computer will let me go back to the PowerPoint.

167
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
Where are you?

168
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Here.

169
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,720
Okay, so let's try to...

170
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,660
Yes, so here we are.

171
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,140
So let's say in the case, we take this loudspeaker and we put a Zobel on it.

172
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:46,760
What it will do is, it will start to cut this part of the frequency range, the highest frequencies.

173
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,840
And as you see, this is a Bauer-Wilkins 805D3.

174
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,340
And it has a big peak at 10 kilohertz.

175
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:02,480
So if we would put a Zobel on, then that would tame that 10 kilohertz region.

176
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,860
So it wouldn't sound as harsh.

177
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,340
And of course, if it has that 10 kilohertz region, it's not just the speaker sounding

178
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
harsh.

179
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,560
But if your amplifier has hard distortion at 10 kilohertz, it will be extremely painful,

180
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:24,440
because your loudspeaker will bump it up like 5 dB higher than the average output of the

181
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,280
loudspeaker.

182
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,780
And in that if we tame it, then we don't just tame that unruliness of the speaker, but we

183
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,700
also mitigate the fact that it does to the hard distortion coming from your amplifier.

184
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:43,580
However, when we go higher in frequency, let's say 20 kilohertz, now the output has dropped

185
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,420
tremendously by 20 kilohertz.

186
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,220
And if we add the Zobel, it will be even lower than that.

187
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:59,760
So ultimately, with the Zobel, it will not help us to fix the very top of the high frequency.

188
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:07,260
And what you might end up is add a Zobel plus add a super tweeter or an ultrasonic tweeter

189
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:16,880
that will help you to fill out that 15 plus kilohertz region that now you realize is just

190
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,260
not there at the level you want.

191
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:29,620
However another issue, the big issue with impedance occurs down there, that region.

192
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:39,620
like below 200 hertz, we start to have some, but mostly it's below like 60 hertz, where

193
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:42,500
it gets really painful and really taxing.

194
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,440
But that's time for another video to expand on that.

195
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,060
And thank you for being here.

196
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:56,760
Thank you for watching, for educating yourself and keeping me company virtually through the

197
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,760
ethers of the internet.

198
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
And have a wonderful day.

199
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Bye bye.

200
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,760
Bye bye.

201
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,760
Bye bye.

202
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,900
Bye bye.
