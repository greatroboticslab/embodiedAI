Wonderful, Thank you!

👍🐝

Great video lecture, thank you!

I am musing on why these tasks are so difficult for robots ro perform. The. most general answer, I think, is that humans are more amazing than we usually realize. Other animals -- with a few quite limited exceptions among the primates -- cannot master most of these tasks either.   Another reason is that young humans receive huge amounts of expert supervision and personalized training by adults, while robots are not very amenable to such training. And note that training and supervision of young humans by older ones is only possible because the young ones are small and not very strong. If the robots could likewise start out small, weak and incidentally good at mimicry, it would be far easier for humans to train them.

My Learnings  Robotics Q&A Q: What are some of the tasks that robots can perform with artificial intelligence? A: Robots can perform tasks such as slotting a battery into a remote control, tearing off a piece of tape and putting it on a box, putting a shoe on a person, and candy unwrapping.  Q: What are some challenges associated with getting policies to do certain tasks? A: One challenge is being able to react quickly to what's happening, such as finding where the flap is on the candy and opening it. Another challenge is the amount of data needed to complete certain tasks.  Q: What are some of the most promising approaches for building robots with true artificial intelligence? A: Scaling up data, allowing robots to adapt at test time, and embodiment are some of the most promising approaches.  Q: What are some resources for learning more about robotics? A: Some resources include the Majoco physics simulator, the Robot Brains podcast, robot conferences such as Robotic Science and Systems and the Conference on Robot Learning, and course content.  Q: What advice would you give to someone new to the field of robotics? A: Start by getting your feet wet, try building a robot from scratch or playing around with robots in simulation. Learn more about reinforcement learning and explore resources such as the Robot Brains podcast and robot conferences.  Key Points Robots can perform a variety of tasks with artificial intelligence, from simple actions like slotting a battery to more complex actions like unwrapping candy. Reacting quickly to situations and acquiring enough data are some of the challenges in getting policies to do certain tasks. Scaling up data, allowing robots to adapt at test time, and embodiment are promising approaches to building robots with true artificial intelligence. Resources for learning more about robotics include simulators, podcasts, conferences, and course content. To get started in robotics, try building a robot from scratch or experimenting with simulations, and explore resources like the Robot Brains podcast and robot conferences.

Hi Eli! Glad you enjoyed it, thanks for watching.
