00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,500
In this video I'm going to show you how to build a simple audio amplifier that can power

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,480
nearly any speaker. For less than $3 in parts it gets surprisingly loud. This tutorial was

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,720
supported by The Great Courses Plus. In my previous videos about amplifiers I showed

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,080
you how to make a simple op amp circuit that can power headphones and another one where

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,720
I showed you how to make a powerful class D design. But what if you just want a simple

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,680
amplifier that can drive a speaker without all the fancy switch mode circuitry? The LM

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:35,440
386 is an all-in-one class AB audio amplifier chip and it's the easiest way to power a

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,640
speaker. This chip has been around for decades and it's still used to this day in products

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,400
like computer speakers and portable stereos. So everyone who works with electronics needs

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,620
to know about this chip. The maximum power output is roughly 1 watt, which doesn't sound like

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,380
much in a world full of deceptive marketing, but trust me, 1 watt going into a speaker is

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:59,300
more than enough power to fill an entire living room full of sound.

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:04,380
The first thing you're going to need is a 3.5mm audio plug attached to a cable. There

14
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,660
are many ways to get this. You could solder wires onto a plug, or cut up an extension cable,

15
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,360
but I think the cheapest way to do this is to just cut up headphones from the dollar store.

16
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,920
After I was done being a stripper, I used some sandpaper to remove the insulation on the left

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,580
and right signal wires. And I soldered on some thicker wire to make it easier to connect

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,100
the cable to a breadboard. I also twisted the two ground wires together.

19
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,180
Next, we're going to implement the simplest possible stereo to mono conversion circuit.

20
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,900
It's just putting 1kohm resistors in series with the audio channels, then joining the

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:43,080
ends together. Now, this is definitely not the best way to do stereo to mono, as we're

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,920
just averaging the signals here, but the point of this project is to create the simplest amplifier

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,180
possible, and this trick works surprisingly well. Next, you're going to need an LM386 chip.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,680
They are so popular that you can get them from anywhere that sells electronic components.

25
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,880
If you want, you could get them from Amazon for less than a dollar apiece. Just make sure

26
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,220
you get the DIP-8 version that's suitable for breadboarding, not the surface mount version.

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,760
I want you to be aware that there are a couple of versions of the LM386 out there that have

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:20,580
different input voltage and output power ratings. For example, the LM386N-1 works from 4 to 12 volts,

29
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,580
and the dash 4 works from 5 to 18 volts. For this project, I'm going to be using the LM386N-4.

30
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,580
It'll give you the flexibility to crank up the supply voltage for the full watt of power.

31
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Ok, here's the partial schematic. For the power, I'm going to use a 9 volt battery, but I really

32
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,580
recommend using something like a 12 volt lead acid battery, or a 12 volt wall adapter, because that'll let you turn up the volume

33
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,580
louder without distortion, and this circuit can drain a 9 volt battery very quickly.

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:55,580
I also recommend putting a 100 microfarad capacitor in parallel with the power supply, reasonably close to the chip,

35
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,580
so that the amplifier can instantly get the power it'll need for loud bass notes.

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:07,580
This capacitor is also used for filtering, and it'll help make sure that noise from the power supply doesn't get passed into the audio amplification circuitry.

37
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,580
47 microfarads or higher will work just fine, and I used 100 microfarads just because that's what I had available.

38
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,580
On the output of the LM386, you should put a 1000 microfarad capacitor or higher.

39
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,580
This will ensure that no DC voltage could possibly get passed into your speaker, which would damage it.

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,580
Don't be misled by crappy schematics that you find on the internet with low values like 100 microfarads.

41
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,580
You want to use at least 1000 microfarads to guarantee good bass with a wide variety of speakers.

42
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:42,580
If you want to know more about why, make sure you've watched my video on RC highpass filters.

43
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,580
Alright, let's power this thing up!

44
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Ugh, this metal sounds like Bieber.

45
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,580
Okay, so what's going on here?

46
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:04,580
The schematic I'm showing you is very similar to other schematics on the internet, but as you know, you can't trust everything you see on the internet.

47
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,580
Let's look at the output on an oscilloscope to figure out what's going on.

48
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:17,580
Okay, so we have what looks like a normal audio waveform, but on top of it there's a large amount of noise.

49
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,580
And that's what's causing this horrible sound.

50
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,580
Zooming in on the noise, you can see that it's about 2.2 MHz.

51
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,580
That's literally 100 times higher than any frequency we should be seeing out of an audio amplifier.

52
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:37,580
It turns out that our amplifier is oscillating, and we need to get all of this high frequency garbage out of our feedback loop,

53
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,580
so it's only amplifying audio frequencies.

54
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,580
Now, normally what you do here is add an RC highpass filter that'll send all the high frequency current to ground,

55
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,580
so it can't interfere with the audio.

56
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,580
But I found an even simpler solution, and it works for all the speakers I tried it with.

57
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,580
You can just put a 0.1uF capacitor in parallel with the output, and it'll stop all the unwanted oscillation.

58
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:07,580
Now the amplifier sounds exactly as it should, and you can see that the high frequency oscillation is gone.

59
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Now, to give you an idea of how loud this thing can go, I'm standing right next to the camera.

60
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,580
And this is what you can just pop in with my piano, you can do it.

61
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,580
And that's what you can do everywhere, you can do it now.

62
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,580
Next, I'd like to give you a couple of close-up shots of the breadboard, to give you some ideas of how you can build this thing.

63
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,580
Keeping the wires as short as possible is the best way to keep unwanted noise out of your circuit.

64
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
So yeah, that's it!

65
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,580
For less than $3 in parts and a few minutes of your time, you can build an amplifier that'll work with any line-level audio source,

66
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,580
like phones, MP3 players, and laptops.

67
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,580
