Now we're\ngoing to take resistors and capacitors again, only this time we're going to use them with active\ncircuitry which is going to boost the gain of the signal after it's been filtered. How we're going\nto do that is with a little circuit called an op-amp. And an op-amp, or an operational amplifier,\nis a type of configurable high-gain amplifier where you can set clever feedback networks with\nsimple components like resistors and capacitors that can change the gain of the circuit depending\non what's going on. We're going to start with the most basic op-amp circuit that you can get. So let\nme just explain this very quickly. This is an op-amp circuit symbol. So we've got two inputs,",

That's why we call this a follower, because if you follow, if you think the\ncircuit through, if this is one volt, this wants to be one volt, there's no circuitry here, so the output\njust needs to be one volt. So minus one volt, if this is minus one volt here, what does this one want to be?\nIt's going to be minus one volt. So very easy to see that the output just looks exactly the same as the input.\nEasy peasy. So this is called a follower, and this is essentially what we can think of as a buffer.\nOkay, so that's all well and good. I'm sure you can see how that's useful, but it doesn't really do anything.\nYou just get the outputs the same as the input. How do we get up-amp circuits that do stuff?\nWell, let's have a look what happens when we put some stuff in this feedback path.\nOkay, so by putting two resistors in the feedback circuit, I think you can probably imagine that I've",

And we can\nimagine that the output is still going to look something like this input. Obviously I've already\ngiven it away and told you that it's non-inverting. So how do we tell what the relationship is between\nthe output and the input? Well, we can see down here that what we've essentially done is we've made a voltage\ndivider from the output down to ground. I just put output, that's this point here, and this point here is\nthis point here. So the output of our voltage divider, this goes to our inverting input. Then we can see that\nthe ratio of these two resistors is going to set the voltage at this point, which is then going to be\nwhat's fed back into here. So the output is going to do what it can to make sure that the voltage at this\npoint here is the same as this point here. Remember our golden rule from before. And so what it needs to\ndo is drop enough voltage across this whole voltage divider to make this point the same as this point.",

So if this was 100k, this was 1k, the k's\ncancel out, so we've essentially got 100 over 1, which is 100 plus 1, 101. Okay, so if this were 10k, then this output would have to be\n11 volts to get 1 volt here. And so we can see that, let's just leave it like this, that we're going to get an output\nthat is much bigger. We're going to have an output that's 10 times bigger than our input. That's how you make a\nnon-inverting amplifier. So there's one more variation that I want to show you before we go on to building our active filter.\nOkay, so this is a slightly more interesting configuration. Now this time we've still got negative feedback, see, so\nwe can still use our first golden rule, but we're applying the input signal to the same input that we're\nfeeding back. So our feedback is going to kind of be\nmixed with our input signal, which is going to be giving us some very interesting results. The second really interesting thing,\nnow we've got this non-inverting input connected to ground. So what does that do with our circuit?",
