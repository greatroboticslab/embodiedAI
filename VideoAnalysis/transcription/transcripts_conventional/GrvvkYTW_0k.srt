00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,040
Hi, I'm James, the Bald Engineer. Both of these are transistors. One is a BJT and the other is a

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,220
MOSFET. Can you tell the difference? If not, that's okay, because in this Atoms video, we're going to

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:18,180
take a look at MOSFETs, how they work, and how you can use them in your circuits. So let's get going.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
This video is part of a two-part series on transistors. The previous one covered bipolar

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:43,200
junction transistors, BJTs, while this video covers metal oxide semiconductor field effect

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,700
transistors, known as MOSFETs. Generally, you'll use a BJT for small loads, say less than 1 amp of

7
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,440
current, while MOSFETs are well suited for applications with much higher current. For the

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,800
video on BJTs, see atoms.com slash ep10. For now, let's move on to MOSFETs.

9
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:09,280
MOS is a flowerless plant that typically grows 1 to 10 centimeters. Some mosses grow up to 50

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,840
centimeters and can be commonly found on trees. Wait a minute, this is the wrong script. Hold on,

11
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,520
the tree sounds right. Okay, here's the other stuff. Okay, let's try this again.

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:31,120
MOSFETs belong to a family tree of field effect transistors, or known as FETs. There are JFETs,

13
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:37,820
MOSFETs, and IGBTs. JFETs actually work a little bit like a BJT, which we've already talked about.

14
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:44,560
For this video, we're focused on the MOSFET, which has two types of modes, called depletion and

15
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:52,160
enhancement. A depletion mode MOSFET works like a normally closed switch. Current can flow

16
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:59,880
when no voltage is applied. Applying a negative voltage actually causes the current flow to stop.

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,380
An enhancement mode FET works like a variable resistor. They come in N-channel and P-channel types.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,480
Enhancement mode FETs are by far the most common transistor used today, so let's focus in on them.

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:23,560
Here's the symbol for an N-channel enhancement mode MOSFET, and here's a TO220 style transistor.

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,140
The pins of a MOSFET are identified as the gate, the drain, and the source.

21
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:39,200
The field effect part of their name suggests they work by voltage, compared to a BJT, which works by current.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:49,120
When voltage is applied between the gate and the source, current is allowed to flow between the drain and the source.

23
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Here's the really cool thing about MOSFETs. They are variable resistors controlled by voltage,

24
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,180
which means depending on the voltage applied between the gate and source,

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,260
the resistance between the drain and source will vary.

26
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,420
With a low voltage at the gate, the resistance from the drain to source is very high.

27
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,640
It's kind of like an open switch.

28
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,500
As we increase the voltage at the gate, we pass a threshold voltage,

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,320
and then the resistance from the drain to the source drops, and it drops very quickly.

30
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,720
The key difference between a MOSFET and a BJT is that the output current isn't a multiplier of the input,

31
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,940
because MOSFETs are all about voltage.

32
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,020
Since the resistance is between the drain and source, it is known as RDS-ON,

33
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,280
and can always be found in the MOSFETs datasheet.

34
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,300
For example, this is a FQP30N06L.

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,540
Let's take a look at its datasheet from Fairchild.

36
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,760
We can see that RDS is given when there are two different voltages from gate to source.

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,220
At 10 volts, the on resistance will be about 27 milliohms,

38
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:10,560
and while at 5 volts, the on resistance is only about 35 milliohms.

39
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,820
That's pretty small when you think about it.

40
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,880
We picked this MOSFET on purpose.

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,080
It is known as a logic-level MOSFET,

42
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,460
because the voltage from gate to source, VGS, is lower than 5 volts.

43
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,960
In other words, the threshold to turn the MOSFET on is low enough to be used by an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

44
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,540
Not all MOSFETs are logic-level compatible,

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:41,400
so it is very important to check to see what the VGS threshold is before using it in your circuit.

46
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,780
Since you will probably use a MOSFET in high-current applications,

47
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,860
it is important to check how hot it is going to get.

48
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,160
Here's how we calculate if we need a heatsink or not.

49
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,240
The formula to determine how much power the MOSFET dissipates is resistance times current squared.

50
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,380
In this case, the resistance is RDS on,

51
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,120
and the current is whatever your load will draw.

52
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,220
Let's use an example of a motor that draws 1 amp of current.

53
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,300
This means we multiply 35 milliohms by 1 amp squared to get 35 milliwatts.

54
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,900
Okay, now we need a few more things from the datasheet.

55
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,480
First, we need the junction to ambient coefficient, which is R theta J A,

56
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,540
and in this case is 62.5 degrees C per watt.

57
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,380
We also need the maximum junction temperature,

58
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,680
which in this case is 175 degrees C.

59
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,760
Using this formula, we can calculate the maximum power the transistor can dissipate

60
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,240
without using a heatsink.

61
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,260
We take the maximum junction temperature minus the ambient temperature,

62
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,420
which is going to be 25 degrees C,

63
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,600
and divide by the thermal resistance.

64
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,980
This gives a maximum dissipation of 2.4 watts.

65
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:04,160
In our example, we are only dissipating 35 milliwatts,

66
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,460
so we're safe to operate without a heatsink.

67
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,960
Now, you might be wondering,

68
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,240
how can the number we calculate be 2.4 watts,

69
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
when the datasheet clearly said 79 watts?

70
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,400
And that's a really great point.

71
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,400
The 79 watts is if we had the ability to cool the transistor's case to 25 degrees C,

72
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,160
which means you have to be using some kind of heatsink.

73
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,220
But we're going to cover more on that in a later video.

74
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,520
Let's review what you need to know to use a MOSFET as a switch.

75
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,180
Number one, find out which pin is the gate, drain, and source.

76
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,700
Number two, look at the datasheet to determine the threshold voltage,

77
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:49,140
which is going to be shown as VGS or VTH.

78
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,920
Find the drain-to-source resistance or RDS on.

79
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,160
Number four, look at R theta, JA,

80
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,940
and the maximum junction temperature to calculate how hot the MOSFET will get.
