The slide is divided into two main sections: \"Like in a simulator\" and \"Remove networks from a given measured result\". \n\nThe first section, \"Like in a simulator\", suggests that embedding/de-embedding is similar to a simulator. It implies that the process is similar to a simulation, where networks are removed or added to the VVA. \n\nThe second section, \"Remove networks from a given measured result\", suggests that the process of embedding/de-embedding is done by removing networks from a VVA. This is done to obtain a VVA that is free from the network.\n\nThe slide also includes a diagram of a VVA, which is a virtual analog workspace. This diagram is likely used to illustrate the process of embedding/de-embedding. \n\nThe slide also mentions that a standard DUT (Device Under Test) and a standard DIO (Data In/Out) are required for the process. This suggests that the process involves hardware components.\n\nThe slide also mentions that the first part of the process must be performed before the second part. This implies that the process is sequential.\n\nOverall, the slide provides an overview of the concept of embedding/de-embedding in Embedded Systems. It explains the process in a simple and understandable manner."
