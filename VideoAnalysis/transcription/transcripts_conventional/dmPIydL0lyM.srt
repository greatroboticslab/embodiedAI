00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,400
Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel all about electronics.

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,160
So, in this video, we will learn about the bandpass and the penstop filter.

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,380
So in the last couple of videos, we had seen that how to design the active as well as the

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:36,720
passive low pass and the high pass filter using the resistor and the capacitor.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,040
And we had seen that this low pass filter passes the low frequency components from the

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,200
input signal while the high pass filter passes the high frequency components from the input

7
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,500
signal.

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,540
But sometimes in some applications, we are only interested in the particular band of frequencies.

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,820
So, for such applications, we can use this bandpass filter.

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:03,280
So as you can see, this bandpass filter passes only certain band of frequencies.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,280
And it rejects all the frequencies which is outside of this band.

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,360
So now there are many ways in which we can design this bandpass filter.

13
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,240
And one of the way is to design this bandpass filter using the series RLC circuit.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,960
And particularly, when you take the output across this resistor, then the response of this circuit

15
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,560
will be very similar to the response of this bandpass filter.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,240
And we have already seen this in the earlier videos of a series resonance in the RLC circuit.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,340
So for more information, you can check that video.

18
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,260
But in this video, we will learn how to design this bandpass filter just by using this high

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,240
pass and the low pass filter.

20
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,600
So, just by cascading this high pass filter and the low pass filter, we can design this

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,220
bandpass filter.

22
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:52,920
So now let's understand how this combination will act as a bandpass filter.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,360
So let's say, we have one low pass filter which is having a cutoff frequency let's say

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,360
FC1.

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:05,280
And let's say we have one high pass filter which is having a cutoff frequency of FC2.

26
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,300
Now whenever we cascade this high pass and the low pass filter, then we will get an overlapping

27
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,400
region between the individual responses of this high pass and the low pass filter.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,960
And this overlapping region will act as a bandpass filter.

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:24,580
So in this way, just by cascading this high pass and the low pass filter, we can design

30
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,680
this bandpass filter.

31
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,560
So now if you see the frequency response of this bandpass filter, you will immediately notice

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,280
that this filter will have two cutoff frequencies.

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,200
The one is known as the lower cutoff frequency and the other frequency is known as the higher

34
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,160
cutoff frequency.

35
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,380
And beyond these cutoff frequencies, the roll-off will be at the rate of 20 dB per decade.

36
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,660
And that is particularly true when you design this bandpass filter just by cascading the first

37
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,240
order high pass and the low pass filter.

38
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,360
Now, the frequency difference between this cutoff frequency is known as the bandwidth of

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,220
this bandpass filter.

40
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,020
So now let's see some of the parameters which defines this bandpass filter.

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,800
So as I said earlier, the difference between the two cutoff frequencies is known as the

42
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,820
bandwidth of this filter.

43
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,120
And the geometric mean of these two cutoff frequencies is known as the center frequency of this bandpass

44
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
filter.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:25,880
So, for this frequency response, the center frequency will be somewhere around here.

46
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,720
So that will be the center frequency of this bandpass filter.

47
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,520
And if we see the phase response of this bandpass filter, then the phase response will look

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,240
like this.

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,620
So as you can see, at zero frequency, the output will lead the input by a 90 degree.

50
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:48,400
And as we move toward the center frequency, the phase difference will gradually reduce.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,060
So now, when we start moving away from this center frequency, then the output will start

52
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,600
lagging the input signal.

53
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,680
And at f is equal to infinity, the output will lag the input by a 90 degree.

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,700
Alright, so now as we have seen the phase and the frequency response of this bandpass filter,

55
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,180
so let's take one example based on this bandpass filter.

56
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,500
So in this example, we have given this filter and we have been asked to find the bandwidth of

57
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,300
this given filter.

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,900
So as you can see in this example, the high pass filter and the low pass filter are cascaded.

59
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,500
And using this cascade connection, the bandpass filter has been designed.

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,460
So, to find the bandwidth of this filter, first of all let's find the cutoff frequency of

61
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,500
this individual high pass and the low pass filter.

62
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,000
So, let's first of all find the cutoff frequency of this high pass filter.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,040
And let's assume that the cutoff frequency of this high pass filter is fc1 and the cutoff

64
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,400
frequency of this low pass filter is fc2.

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,000
Now, we know that the cutoff frequency of this high pass filter can be given by the equation

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,380
1dr by 2π into RC.

67
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,400
So now, if we put the value of this resistor and capacitor, then we will find the cutoff frequency

68
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
of this low pass filter.

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,880
So, let's see, the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter will be around 10.61 kHz.

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:17,440
So in this way, we have found this cutoff frequency of this high pass filter as 10.61 kHz.

71
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,920
So similarly, now let's find the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter.

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,960
So again, the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter can be given by the equation 1dr by

73
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,000
2π into RC.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,160
And if we put the value of this resistor and capacitor, then the cutoff frequency of this

75
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,020
low pass filter will be 106.1 kHz.

76
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:49,060
So in this way, we have found the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter as 106.1 kHz.

77
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,960
So now, the bandwidth of this band pass filter can be defined as the difference between these

78
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,120
two cutoff frequencies.

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:09,060
So the bandwidth of this band pass filter will be FC2-FC1 that is equal to 106.1-10.61 kHz.

80
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,940
And that is nothing but 95.5 kHz.

81
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,500
So roughly we can say that this band pass filter having a bandwidth of 100 kHz.

82
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,180
So in this example, now if you see here, we have designed this band pass filter just by

83
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,280
cascading this passive, high pass and the low pass filter.

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,820
And as this filter is designed using this passive components, so the actual values of this cutoff

85
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:37,620
frequencies will be slightly different from the designed values.

86
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,460
And the reason is that the input impedance of this high pass filter will affect the cutoff

87
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,120
frequency of this low pass filter.

88
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:58,060
So, in this way, because of this cascade connection of this passive filters, the design frequencies

89
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,060
and the actual cutoff frequencies will be slightly different.

90
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,280
And to avoid that, we can isolate the two stages by using the buffer.

91
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,520
So, in the last video, we have already seen that, by using this op-amp as a buffer, we

92
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,340
can isolate the different stages of this filter.

93
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,580
So instead of using this passive low pass and the high pass filter, we can use this active

94
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,980
low pass and the high pass filter.

95
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,240
And just by cascading these two active low pass and the high pass filter, we can design

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,780
this band pass filter.

97
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:31,220
And by using this op-amp as a buffer, we can isolate the two different stages as well.

98
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,340
And suppose if we want the gain from this active filter, then we can configure this op-amp either

99
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,620
in a inverting or a non-inverting configuration.

100
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,400
So in this way, not only we can isolate the two different stages, but we can also achieve

101
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,540
the gain out of this filter.

102
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,180
So now like we have seen this band pass filter, let's see one more filter whose response is

103
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,320
exactly opposite to that of this band pass filter.

104
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:00,080
So this filter is known as the band stop filter or a band reject filter.

105
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,700
So this band stop or a band reject filter rejects certain band of frequencies and it passes

106
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,620
all other frequencies which is out of this particular band.

107
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,840
And if we see the frequency response of this band stop filter, it will look like this.

108
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,320
So like as you can see here, this band stop filter rejects a particular band of frequencies

109
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,060
and it passes all other frequencies which is beyond this particular band.

110
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,600
So now in the earlier video of resonance in the parallel RLC circuit, we have already seen

111
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,740
that by connecting this resistor, capacitor and inductor in a parallel, we can design this

112
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,160
band stop filter.

113
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,060
And particularly when we take the output across this resistor, then the response of this parallel

114
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,560
RLC circuit will be very similar to the response of this band stop filter.

115
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,480
So for more information, you can check that video on a resonance in the parallel RLC circuit.

116
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,480
But in this video, we will see that how we can design this band stop filter by using this

117
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,560
low pass and the high pass filter.

118
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,860
So before we see that, first of all let us carefully see once again the response of this

119
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,880
band stop filter.

120
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,000
So now if you see the response, particularly this portion, this is nothing but the response

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,980
of the low pass filter.

122
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:25,380
So, in this way, just by adding the responses of this low pass filter and the high pass filter,

123
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,360
we can design this band stop filter.

124
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,920
So now what we can do, we can provide the same input to this both low pass as well as

125
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,640
the high pass filter.

126
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,760
And just by adding their individual responses, we can get this response of a band stop filter.

127
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,160
And we can easily achieve this response by using this op-amp circuit.

128
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,240
So as you can see here, this portion is nothing but the high pass filter.

129
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,700
And the lower portion is nothing but the low pass filter.

130
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,640
So as you can see here, we have given the same input to this low pass as well as the high

131
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,380
pass filter.

132
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:05,920
And just by adding their individual responses by summer circuit, we can design this band stop

133
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
filter.

134
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,800
So now to get more idea about this band stop filter, let's take one example.

135
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:17,120
So in this example, we have been given the design of this active band stop filter.

136
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,840
And in this example, we have been asked to find the stop band of this band stop filter.

137
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,680
So the stop band is nothing but the frequency band which is being rejected by this band stop

138
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
filter.

139
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,360
And to find that, first of all let's find the cutoff frequency of these individual filters.

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,080
Let's say the cutoff frequency of this high pass filter is let's say FC1 and the cutoff

141
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,820
frequency of this low pass filter is let's say FC2.

142
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:46,960
And as we know, the cutoff frequency for this high pass filter can be given by the expression

143
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,340
1 divided by 2π into RC.

144
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,300
And if we put all the values of this resistor and capacitor, then the value of this cutoff frequency

145
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,300
will be 994Hz.

146
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,020
So, in this way, we have found the cutoff frequency of this high pass filter is 1.59kHz.

147
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,760
Similarly, now let's find the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter.

148
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,960
So, the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter can be given by the expression 1 divided by 2.2

149
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,500
RC.

150
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,440
And if we put all the values of this resistor and capacitor, then we will get this cutoff frequency

151
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
as 994Hz.

152
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:25,440
So, in this way, we have found the cutoff frequency of this high pass filter is 1.59kHz.

153
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,980
And the cutoff frequency of this low pass filter is 994Hz.

154
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,440
So, the stop band can be given by FC2-FC1 that is,

155
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,600
1590Hz-994Hz.

156
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,860
That is nothing but 596Hz.

157
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:54,160
So we can say that this band stop filter rejects the band of frequencies starting from roughly

158
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,820
around 1kHz and up to 1.6kHz.

159
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,580
So this filter rejects around 600Hz of frequencies between these two cutoff frequencies.

160
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,980
And it passes all the frequencies which is beyond these cutoff frequencies.

161
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,200
So, now so far, this band pass and the band stop filters which we have discussed are the

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,040
second order filters.

163
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,740
Because if you see the transfer function of these two filters, they will have two number

164
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,940
of poles in the denominator.

165
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,220
And in another way if you see, these two filters had two number of reactive components in their

166
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,220
circuitry.

167
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,820
So in that sense also, we can say that these two filters were the second order filters.

168
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,000
So now, if you want the sharp cutoff, then we can go for the higher order filters.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,980
So I hope in this video you understood about this band pass as well as the band stop filter.

170
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,220
