2:54 I'm lost can somebody explain

Very nice explanation.

hi Dr you take the link masses at the end of each link  are they at the center of each link? thank you

can we apply these dynamics on mobile robots as well?? by assigning frames at different positions of the robot

It is just an example, you can set them wherever you want.

But the inertia moment for the lagrantian will change.

you'd have to adapt them but since the Lagrangian is an energy evaluation formula, you can. You can also apply them to end effectors attached to an arbitrary body that can move in space.

Ya there are a lot of research papers on comparing lagrangian vs euler methods for mobile robots
