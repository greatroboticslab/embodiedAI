@aleksandarhaber  how do u fix MCTL-003 FAULT?

@Kelland.24  You got a free tutorial, I do not have the time and energy to reply to your questions.

Thanks, will do!

Simple use of the google search engine can help to answer these types of questions.

Yes, they are, and they are actually very useful and can save time if a person knows how to properly code them.

English?

Thank you!

I am not an expert on this topic. However, I think that it should be possible.

We made this table. First, we purchased a plate, and then we drilled the holes with screw threads. The table is super useful for mounting different equipment. Everything that FANUC sells is super expensive...

There are so many things you can do with FANUC robots. Different types of offsets exist, and if you think about something like this:  https://www.cnctrainingcentre.com/fanuc-mill/work-offsets/  This should be possible.
