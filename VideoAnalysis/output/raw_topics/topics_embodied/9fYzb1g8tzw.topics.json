Now I've looked at a few other quads from Darwin FPV and I'm always\nimpressed because unlike some of the other people out there making these kind of ready-to-fly things,\nthe Darwin FPV stuff is a little bit less expensive. So it's kind of in the price range\nof a lot more pilots but they do put a lot of thought and love into these things and this\n25 is the latest one. So I thought I'd get it in and we'll have a go. Now this is available in a",

It comes with Walksnail and I've got the analog version here.\nSo it's been a while since I've reviewed an analog quad but lots of you pilots out there I know\nare still flying analog. Other 60% of all my viewers last time we did a poll are still flying analog and\nwaiting for digital HD and maybe making a choice in the spring. So let me unbox this and go through\nthe specs, talk about some of the cool stuff. Let's give it a fly and see what it's like.\nSo the big thing with this is this is like that kind of big whoop style where it has a high strength\none-piece injection molded prop guard. Very useful because it means that you can bounce off stuff.",

So again this is the Darwin FPV\nCine Ape 25. It's an X style layout. Six bladed props. Wheelbase is 112 millimeters. Dimensions of this\nthing isn't particularly big. It's a nice size for flying around large indoor environments and also\nflying outside as well. So it's about 160 by 160 by 43 millimeters. Flight controller on this is an F411\nbase thing and it does have 30 amp 3 to 4S ESCs. I'm running mine on 4S here. Again as I said in the\nintroduction this happens to be the analog version. Comes with a Caddx ant. Not a fan of the ant\nunfortunately but we'll see how it performs here in a moment with a 600 milliwatt analog VTX. But",

Motors are 1504 3600 kV and those propellers are HQ prop T63 MMX6 propellers. Recommended\nbattery for this is an 850 milliamp power 4S pack. They reckon you'll get about nine minutes hovering\ntime. Realistically I think you're going to get a little bit less and I'll talk about what I got.\nI'm using a slightly smaller battery to make it a little bit more nimble. I'm using a 650 milliamp\npower battery rather than the recommended 850. So let's have a very quick look at the configuration.\nNow I can plug it into the computer.

CPU load is pretty high running about 52% there at\nthe bottom but then it's an F4 base flight controller. This is how it's set up. Pretty standard stuff here.\nPower and battery is set like this. Seems to work okay. Failsafe is set to drop which is what you want.\nPid tuning as you'll see in a moment from the flying is very relaxed and gentle but for a kind\nof a filming mini quad like this that's exactly what you want. Although you can get quite a turn\nof speed out of this thing it can hoop around when you need to. Receiver again set for SBUS by default.\nThis is how it comes. You could also set it up for other stuff as well but the little cable that comes\non it is kind of designed to be plugged or soldered onto an SBUS receiver. Modes are set like this.
