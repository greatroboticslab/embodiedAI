1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,840
If you are one of those who think that diodes are very simple,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,400
I must say that you are completely wrong.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,480
It is really unfair to think that diodes are very simple components and they can only rectify

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,560
current. In this video, I will talk about diodes and their application, not inner structure or

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,000
chemistry, and introduce three main types of diodes with eight applications of them in circuits.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,080
Please stay with me in the rest of this video.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,800
Diodes! These little components are so tricky. They put out of sight their talent. Maybe they

8
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,280
are afraid of being used in your project. But don't worry, I will reveal their secret in few minutes.

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,160
To begin with, I am going to take a brief look at ideal diode.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,680
This is a schematic symbol of a diode. It has two pins, anode or positive and cathode or negative.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,680
There is a line in the cathode side of real diodes to specify a negative or cathode side. Look here,

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
this silver line here and this one.

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,720
This diode specifies the cathode side by a black line.

14
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:29,360
If you change this line to a shape like S, first letter of Schottky, it becomes a Schottky diode

15
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:39,120
schematic symbol like this. And if you replace this line with a shape like Z, first letter of Zener,

16
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,960
it becomes a Zener diode schematic symbol. And if you surround the diode symbol with a circle,

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:55,520
it becomes an LED symbol. This component will allow current to flow in this direction from its

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,560
anode to its cathode and it will block current in opposite direction. If you put voltage to diode in

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,200
right order, I mean positive voltage to anode pin and negative voltage to cathode pin, then your diode

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,480
is in forward bias setup and will allow current to flow. But if you put voltage in opposite direction,

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,680
then your diode is in reverse bias setup and will block current from flowing. First application of

22
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,000
diodes came from this definition. Application number one, using diode as rectifier.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Diodes can pass electricity only in one direction. If you put a diode in an alternative current path,

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,680
it will allow electricity in one direction and block opposite direction.

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Look here, this is a half-wave rectifier. It just passed positive half of sinusoidal wave

26
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,840
and block negative part. Look at this diode carefully. If you apply this yellow signal on anode pin of this

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,920
diode, you will get this blue signal on the cathode pin.

28
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:32,480
This is a full wave rectifier. I am gonna test it.

29
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:40,400
This is a full wave rectifier. This is a full wave rectifier.

30
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,880
And this is a full wave rectifier which pass either negative or positive part of waveform to output,

31
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,360
and in the same time, convert negative wave to positive. A full wave rectifier works like this.

32
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,520
This yellow signal is input sinusoidal wave, and the blue one is output of rectifier. You see,

33
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,000
negative part is reflected to positive side by rectifier.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,320
It seems easy, but you have to be careful in selecting proper diode. These are three important

35
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,320
parameters to consider in selecting diode. All of these parameters are available in data sheet.

36
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,360
In data sheet of every diode, it is available to check how much voltage the diode will tolerant in reverse

37
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,880
by a setup. For example, if you are going to rectify AC power in United States by a half wave rectifier,

38
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,000
you can use these, but you can't use these because of shortage of reverse blocking voltage.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,800
Contrary to what most newbies think, application of diodes is not limited to rectification.

40
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,720
Second application of diodes is my favorite. Application number two.

41
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,400
Using diode for reverse polarity protection to protect or product from inverted polarity.

42
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,840
Think about your product. The result of all those efforts can be lost with just a small mistake.

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,000
If the user connects power supply in wrong polarity, main parts of your circuit will blow up.

44
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,040
Microcontrollers, regulators, ICs, and other stuff. But you can prevent the disaster

45
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,920
with a tiny and cheap Schottky diode. Why Schottky diodes? How to do that? I will explain.

46
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,880
This circuit here presents your main design and here is power input. You must connect your power supply

47
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,520
in right polarity. I mean positive side here and negative side here. Connecting wrong polarity,

48
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:48,800
even for a very short period of time, will blow up whole project. But if you use a Schottky diode here

49
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,240
in this way, it will protect entire project from reverse polarity. You may ask why Schottky diode is

50
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:04,000
used here. Because Schottky diode drop very low portion of input voltage, for example 0.2 volts. If you

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,960
use an ordinary diode here, it will drop around 0.7 volts of power supply. But Schottky diode drops only 0.2 volts.

52
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,680
Sometimes you need to use a rechargeable backup battery in your project to ensure the device

53
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,840
work when power is down. There are many solutions, but using a diode is one of most simple and cheap

54
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,600
approaches. Third application of diodes in circuits is to connect battery and power supply together.

55
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,280
Application number three. Using diodes to connect multiple power sources.

56
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:56,160
Here is most simple way to connect backup battery to power source. Look here, ground of battery and ground

57
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,600
of main power source are connected together here. There is a diode here which connects 12 volts of battery

58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:11,920
to 12 volts of main power source. When power source is up, voltage difference on anode and cutout of this

59
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:20,640
diode is about 0 or even negative voltage and diode is off and the device will work with external power source.

60
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:28,720
But when external power source is down, battery power will flow through the diode and keep the circuit working.

61
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:35,600
I believe you are thinking about charging this battery. Yes, this is a real concern. We need a battery

62
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:42,880
charging circuit here to charge the battery when the external power is up. I will explain how to do it in

63
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:50,400
one of my next videos. You saw diodes can pass electricity in one direction. This is very first definition all of

64
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,200
us learn diodes with. But I recommend to change this definition to a voltage-oriented definition

65
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,760
to better understand some parameters. Voltage-based definition is this.

66
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:10,560
Diods can conduct voltage from their anode pin to their cutout. I mean, if you apply DC voltage to anode pin

67
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:19,520
of a diode, it will conduct voltage to a cutout pin. But if you apply voltage to a cutout pin, anode pin of a diode

68
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:26,640
will not affect it. Be careful, it is a serious danger to grab a diode from a cutout and plug the anode pin to outlet.

69
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:36,320
As said, diodes cannot conduct voltage from cutout to anode, but I mean DC voltage in circuit, not AC power line and your body.

70
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:45,520
In an ideal diode, the voltage comes intact from anode to cutout. But in a real diode, a portion of voltage stays on diode,

71
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,480
and remaining voltage passes and goes to cutout. This feature brings us fourth application of diodes.

72
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,640
Application number 4. Using Diodes to Reduce Voltage

73
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:04,480
Assume that you need 4.3 volts somewhere in your project, but main voltage in your circuit is 5 volts.

74
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,320
For example, you need to run DF Player Module to play music or sound effects in your project.

75
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:18,480
Since this module works with 4.3 volts, you have to provide this voltage for that. What you can do?

76
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:28,560
First thing I think about is using an adjustable voltage regulator and set it on 4.3 volts. Actually,

77
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:35,440
this is best method to do such a project, but using regulators increase project cost. In some cases,

78
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,280
you can use drop voltage of a diode to reduce voltage. You may ask how much voltage a diode can drop.

79
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:50,800
It depends on diode type, ambient temperature, and current flowing through diode. But impact of ambient

80
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,840
temperature and current is ignorable in many cases because of that we consider diode type only.

81
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:05,040
Diodes usually are made of silicon or germanium. Silicon diodes drop voltage around 0.7 volts and

82
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,480
germanium or Schottky diodes drop lower, around 0.2 volts. Exact draft voltage is available on data sheet

83
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:20,800
of each part number. For example, look at this data sheet. Draft voltage of 1N5822 diode in room temperature

84
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:33,280
and current equal to 3A is 0.52 volts. And look at this one. Draft voltage of 1N4007 diode in room temperature

85
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:44,480
and current equal to 1A is 1V. And our last example, 1N4148 diode. Let's look better at this diode and its

86
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:52,720
forward voltage. This is forward voltage graph from data sheet of 1N4148 diode. In first sight,

87
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,160
it is clear that the forward voltage is a function of temperature and current flowing through diode.

88
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:10,160
Let's consider this point. Here, the temperature is 30 degrees and current is equal to 10 milliampers.

89
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:19,360
In this point, forward voltage is around 0.7 volts. By increasing current, forward voltage will get

90
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:27,760
bigger. This approach for reducing voltage is not best way, but it has its own advantages. It is super

91
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:35,360
simple and cheap. And you can use a bunch of diodes in series to reduce more and more voltage. But you

92
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,560
have to be careful. If you use many diodes in series to reduce more voltage, impact of current on voltage

93
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:51,360
drop will be impressive. Let's go to 5th application of diodes. Application number 5. Using Diodes as Flyback.

94
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,920
With a little experiment in electronics, you may have seen a diode attached to every relay in circuits.

95
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,640
This diode is called by many names. Flyback, Flywheel, Snobber, Suppressor, Clamp, and some other names.

96
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,920
Some of new builds don't use this diode in their design because they think it is useless. But this

97
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,720
is one of the most important things to do in your circuit design. By placing a diode in parallel with

98
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,800
relay or other inductive loads, spikes produced by them will be eliminated. By removing this diode from

99
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,080
your design, be ready for awful things in your project.

100
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,360
Look here. One flywheel diode stands beside its relay and connected to it in parallel.

101
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:51,680
Catode pin of diode is toward VCC. In this circuit, I am using a tactile switch to connect or disconnect

102
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:59,120
the diode to see its impact. I am gonna use my function generator to turn the relay on or off 5 times

103
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:15,680
per second and use my oscilloscope to see what is happening in collector pin of transistor.

104
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:36,240
Catode pin of diode is toward VCC. In this circuit, the diode will enter the circuit and eliminate the

105
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:48,800
spike. This is magic of diodes. Look here. The spike is gone. This is the magic of diode. If you refuse to use this diode here,

106
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,840
the microcontroller in your circuit will reset every time the relay switches off.

107
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:02,560
It is not just relays. All types of inductive loads make spikes like DC motors, buzzers, solenoids, etc.

108
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,120
And it is strongly recommended to use a flywheel diode beside them.

109
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,160
Till now, we just considered ordinary diodes. It is time to introduce Zener diodes.

110
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:22,400
Zener diodes are same as ordinary diodes in forward bias, but they act different in reverse bias.

111
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:29,280
Zener diodes have a precise reverse voltage and this characteristic brings us next application of

112
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:34,720
diodes. Application number 6. Using Zener diodes for regulating voltage.

113
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:43,840
Let's consider a 18V Zener diode. It means in reverse bias setup, it will block current by voltages under 18V

114
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:53,680
and start to pass current by voltages over 18V. And it will do its best to keep voltage on itself at 18V.

115
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,440
Notice that we are talking about ideal Zener diode.

116
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:10,560
Look here. This is simple Zener diode circuit. Zener diodes are generally used with a resistor in series to

117
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:18,160
limit current and protect Zener diode from blowing up and to make reference voltage here at this point.

118
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:27,360
But this resistor limits reference voltage power either. I mean this point cannot provide so much current.

119
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,480
So we need to amplify current on this point.

120
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,960
There are so many ways to do that. But one of the most easy and handy way is to use a BJT transistor,

121
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:47,440
which is explained in this card. And another way is to use an off-amp. I will explain this one in one of my next videos.

122
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,720
Application of Zener diodes is not limited to making reference voltages. They sometimes used for

123
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:02,640
protecting circuits from over voltage. Let's see it. Application number 7. Using a Zener diode to protect

124
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,440
circuits from over voltage. There are so many ways to protect circuits from over voltage. But one of the most

125
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:17,120
simple example of them is to use a single Zener diode. You may wonder how it is possible. Let's see example.

126
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,960
This is a sample circuit. You can use a Zener diode here with a fuse like this.

127
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:38,000
If voltage in power supply remains in right value, for example 12V, Zener diode in reverse bias will

128
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,240
remain off. But if over voltage happens here in power supply, Zener diode will pass lots of current

129
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,760
to keep voltage here on 12V and this current will burn the fuse and save whole project.

130
00:16:53,760 --> 00:17:01,200
A single Zener diode in cooperation with a fuse can save whole project. This is amazing.

131
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:10,800
So let's go to next type of diodes. Light emitting diodes or LEDs. Don't look at LEDs like simple or

132
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:18,480
trite components. They are used for many purposes. Lighting up, showing device status, showing parameters,

133
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,000
helping plants to grow, or even communication. These are most important applications of LEDs.

134
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,520
But I am gonna talk about my favorite. Application number 8. Using LEDs for remote communication.

135
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:42,480
LEDs are used for emitting lights, even invisible lights, like infrared or ultraviolet. Most of remote

136
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,920
controllers these days are using infrared pulses to communicate with devices. Let's see how they work.

137
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:58,080
This is a simple remote controller. If I press any button, it will make infrared pulses here with this IR LED.

138
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,640
Look here.

139
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:11,280
If you look at your TV remote controller, you cannot see anything. But here pulses are visible. Because

140
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,640
these pulses are visible to camera, even your cell phone camera.

141
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,520
We saw pulses. But how they work? How we can use a remote controller in our project?

142
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,040
There are IR remote receiver components out in market in various shapes, types, and part numbers.

143
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:39,360
But one of the most popular one is this. With three pins. Two of them are for powering of the component,

144
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:50,320
and third one is for data. This is sample circuit of three-pin infrared receiver.
