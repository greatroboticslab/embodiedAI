This company has started a drone delivery system of packages that will drop it off at your doorstep! This system has an ever-increasing potential for the growing economy. The positives include the decrease in traffic within the cities. No more Amazon vans and reducing the loads for truck drivers. Zipline’s delivery system would also decrease the amount of time for a package to be delivered, potentially being a big competitor against Amazon. This system of delivery also proposes the prospects of human transportation. Although I would not feel safe having a drone transport me, it is a very interesting idea. Maybe I would feel better about it after more security measures are in place or it becomes more common.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOWDNBu9DkU: Amazing Invention- This Drone Will Change Everything"}]}
