Thank you for your helpful video! I think there is a typo at 5:38. You write one of Ptolemy's trig identities as sin( Θ1 +- Θ2) = sin(Θ1)sin(Θ2)  +- cos(Θ1)cos(Θ2), but it should be sin( Θ1 +- Θ2) = sin(Θ1)cos(Θ2)  +- cos(Θ1)sin(Θ2)

love these videos. big ups!!

Fantastic vids

please name the moving and fixed coordinated differently not just small nd big x , it gets confusing sometimes

I wish I could like this a thousand time. Thank you and God bless! On 4:54 you said A_1d_2 + d_1 is only Translation is the rotation matrix (A) discarded?

I can see my professor by your voice (;1876) 😇, again excellent video

Good video

Thank you for pointing this out. You are correct, I did make a mistake. I will pin this comment for others to see. Thanks again!

Thanks a lot!

Thanks a lot. You're awesome!

Hey, apologies for any confusion being created. I probably should I used different letters to avoid but at this point, we are too far ahead in the series that I think I won't be able to change it. A little hint to recognize them would be that when I make the small x (moving frame), it is usually curved and the big X is made  up of two straight lines.

Thank you so much! It is comments like this that makes all the time I spend making these videos worth it. As far as your query is, I don't think I fully understand it. In the equation X = A1A2x + A1d2 + d1, the 'A1A2' term is the one that represents rotation and the other two terms represent translation. We don't discard any term but I am explaining each term one by one. So we first talk about what the rotation terms represent and then later on in the video (at around 7:55) we talk about what the displacement terms represent.  If you still have any confusion or if I misunderstood your question, let me know and I will get back to you. Have a great day!

Thanks!

Thanks a lot Sameer! I hope I am not as boring as most professors, hahahaha :P

Thanks! Glad you enjoyed

Hey brother, assalamualikum,

This playlist is gold. Please add a link to your presentation(blackboard notes) in the description. It will help us a lot with revision. thank you.

@I_Rasool  hey! Walekumassalam

@I_Rasool  thank you for the appreciation. I actually make it in a software which doesn't allow me to export to pdf so I don't think it will really help if I upload the files of the software.
