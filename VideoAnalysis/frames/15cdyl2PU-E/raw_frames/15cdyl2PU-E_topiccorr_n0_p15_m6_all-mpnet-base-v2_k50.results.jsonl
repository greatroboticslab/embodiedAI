The main subjects that are gone over is the features and specs of these devices/components and we are shown how to set them up using both digital and analog systems. First, we go into packaging with the stack motor. The video shows the contents within the packaging and gives a high-level explanation of them. Next is the specifications. We are told about its voltage intake and outtake, connectors and what they are dedicated to, amperage, sensors, and more. Now the video goes into the guidelines portion. We are given the requirements and ways to connect the ready receiver. Such as it can be powered with either 3.3 or 5V, bridge the center pad with either the right or left one, if you leave it unbridged then the ready receiver will not be powered, etc. Next the creator goes into the stack and it shows you the information and process needed to power this and connect it properly. Now we go into the pacer f7 processor. It shows the pins that are needed for connection along with voltage needed. Next, we are given the detailed weight of the components and then we flow into connection to give an overview of the connections needing to be made.
