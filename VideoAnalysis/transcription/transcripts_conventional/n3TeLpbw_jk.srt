1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Maybe this has happened to you. You have a nice, fresh build. You just got done building it. Maybe you bought it.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,320
But you just put props on it. You got your first pack on it. It's time to go maiden flight this thing.

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:19,000
So, you set it down, and, uh, yeah. You get out your radio, you flick your switch, you arm the quad, you raise the throttle, and...

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,700
Well, s***.

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:37,520
Hey, everybody. I'm BaconNinja, and today we are going to cover six of the most common reasons why your new build or new quad in general is doing something stupid and looks like this whenever it takes off for the first time.

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:46,240
Because it happens a lot. A lot of people fall into this trap. They arm their quad after putting their props on. They have a fresh lipo on the thing.

7
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,100
They raise the throttle, and bam, just like that. It does a death roll immediately.

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,180
Now, there are a couple variations on this. Most of the time, it is the death roll.

9
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,980
Sometimes, the quad just won't get off the ground. It looks a little something like this.

10
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:14,340
But before we get into what causes those two things in particular, because those are really the point of this video here,

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm going to talk to you about two incredibly common ones that I see all the time on beginner forums.

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,520
Just because they are out there, and I think it'll be easy to get these questions out of the way.

13
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:31,740
The first one is, why does my quad just shut down completely whenever I go to arm it with my radio?

14
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,860
Well, the chances are that you're testing it on the bench.

15
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,300
It's probably a new build.

16
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,320
And you're going to test it with one of these.

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,340
A smoke stopper.

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,140
Well, if you've got the smoke stopper plugged in between your lipo and the quad,

19
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,820
you're going to have a problem, because these things are made to limit the number of amps that come out of your battery into the quad.

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,960
Just in case you have a short in there, it basically keeps you from frying everything inside your quad with too many amps

21
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,460
and burning it entirely down, which is a good thing, yes.

22
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:07,100
But it does mean that as soon as you arm it and the spinny boys start to their spinning,

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,580
it's going to pull too many amps, and it's just going to shut down.

24
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,280
Now, if you have a smoke stopper like mine, that means you've ruined your smoke stopper.

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,560
But most modern smoke stoppers are actually switch protected, and it'll just kick the thing off.

26
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,820
You'll unplug the lipo.

27
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,820
You'll plug it back in.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,020
It'll act just fine again.

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,860
It's a real mystery for some people.

30
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,860
So just know that if you're testing it on the bench, don't plan on spinning your motors.

31
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,660
There's just enough amps to boot up the flight controller and maybe get the beta flight tones.

32
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,540
Sometimes your quad will even die in the middle of making the tones.

33
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,860
It just pulls too many amps.

34
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,500
And number two is why do my motors not throttle down when I throttle my quad down?

35
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,160
Again, this is most commonly a bench issue.

36
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,900
And most of the time, what you'll find is that when you are testing your quad for the first time,

37
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,640
you haven't put props on yet, you go to arm the thing, you just want to make sure it responds correctly.

38
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,460
Perfectly fine thought process.

39
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,060
But what you aren't understanding is that the PID controller is active as soon as you lift the throttle on the quad.

40
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,520
And because there's no props on the quad, because in this scenario, you don't have your props on yet,

41
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,420
the PID controller says, hey man, what's up, bro?

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,360
You ain't lifting off.

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,500
I'm telling you to get the heck off the table.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,920
Why aren't you getting off the table?

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,720
And it says, I'm spinning my spinny boys, but I'm not going nowhere.

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,920
What do you want me to do, bro?

47
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,880
So then the PID controller says, hey, spinny boys, kick it up a notch.

48
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,240
And then by the time you catch on to what's going on here, no matter what you do with the throttle,

49
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,100
it'll just keep throttling up.

50
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,200
So those are the first two really common things that go wrong with new builds.

51
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,300
One is tripping your smoke stopper when you're testing and then thinking something's wrong with your quad.

52
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,180
It probably isn't just your smoke stopper.

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,820
And number two is your motors will not throttle down after you arm the quad and throttle up unless you have props on.

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,540
So if you're in those two positions, just go ahead and either don't use your smoke stopper, go outside and test it,

55
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,140
or put your props on and then subsequently go outside and test it.

56
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:11,820
Now let's get into the real meat and potatoes of the things that make this stuff happen.

57
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,160
And the one we're going to start with is that second scenario that I showed you where the quad just doesn't lift off the ground.

58
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,040
Let me show you what that looks like again.

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,900
And there are normally two reasons for this one.

60
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,200
And I'm going to roll it all into point number three because I told you there were only six,

61
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,660
but I'm going to give you both reasons for this one up front.

62
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,900
The first one's actually really easy.

63
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,520
If your quad appears to be stuck to the table, it might not be your props.

64
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,140
You might have the thing on turtle mode or flip over after crash.

65
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,680
So what you're going to want to do is go into beta flight with your quad powered on and with your radio powered on.

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,940
And you're going to want to see what modes are active.

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,340
Now let me show you what that looks like.

68
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,500
And we're going to want to go to the modes tab here and just check out what's on.

69
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,040
Now you might see that your arm mode is enabled when you arm the quad.

70
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,640
So try your arming switch and make sure the arm mode is enabled.

71
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,160
But we're looking for one called flip over after crash, which is this one right here.

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,020
And what you want to do is make sure that it is not lit up as if it was active.

73
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,520
You want to make sure the range that it's in is not being activated by something going on on your radio.

74
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,380
Because sometimes that does happen.

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,540
And what flip over after crash is made for is to spin two props at a time, really.

76
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,900
And it might cause your quad to act like it doesn't want to lift off the ground or push down.

77
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,400
But that's only reason one and that's the simple one.

78
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,460
So if you find that flip over after crash is enabled when you're not expecting it to be enabled on your radio,

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:49,720
either you need to make sure the switches on your radio where flip over after crash is assigned are in the proper position.

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,220
Or you need to reassign that mode to a proper switch that you intend to have in the off position during normal flight.

81
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,600
But that's actually not the most common thing.

82
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,400
A lot of people know what modes are going on and if it's active or not.

83
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,960
And actually a lot of pilots probably forget to set that up before they take their first flight anyway.

84
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,540
So I'm going to say that's not the most common thing.

85
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,620
But what is the most common thing and what causes that to happen more often than not is the props being on wrong.

86
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,700
So there are two ways to put your props on that will cause this.

87
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,080
If you'll notice on my quad, I have both leading edges.

88
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,600
So you see this rounded bit of my prop here.

89
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,420
I have both of those facing out from my camera.

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,720
This is what's called a props out configuration.

91
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,640
Now if I were to take this prop and put it in this spot and take this prop and put it in that spot,

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,480
that would mean that I would have one facing out and one facing in.

93
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
So that would be the wrong configuration.

94
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,600
They have to be matched between the front and the back.

95
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,940
You'll see my back ones are the same way.

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,020
And the way you tell the direction of a prop is you look at the leading edge of the top of the prop.

97
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:59,480
So a prop looks kind of like a wing and it swoops down.

98
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,940
It makes this downward swoop through the air.

99
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,280
And that means the part at the top of the swoop is the leading edge of the prop.

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,400
So you want to make sure that you are using the leading edge of the prop to determine the prop orientation on these.

101
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,160
Now another way you can do this incorrectly other than just putting the props on in the wrong direction

102
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,600
is putting them on upside down, which will actually cause the thrust to just push the quad directly into the ground.

103
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,800
Normally it'll just pin it there.

104
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,920
It'll just straight up pin it there.

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,580
And you might have a hard time getting it to stop.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,660
Hopefully your pit controller recognizes it and shuts it down.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,160
If not, you may have to disarm.

108
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,040
But if your quad is just not lifting off the ground or doing this weird fluttering on the ground thing

109
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:45,580
where it's kind of pushing itself around, it's not flipping, it's just pushing itself around,

110
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,160
or it's pinned to the ground, there's a really good chance your props are on incorrectly.

111
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,460
So the first thing you'll want to do is A, make sure your props are not on upside down.

112
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,560
By looking for that leading edge that I was telling you about, making sure that is on the top of the prop.

113
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,540
Then you want to go determine what the motor direction your flight controller expects is set to in Betaflight.

114
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,680
And inside the motors tab of Betaflight, you can see that mine, if you look at these little spinny boy diagrams here,

115
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,440
are meant to be going outward rotation.

116
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,820
Because my checkbox here for motor direction is reversed, is checked.

117
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:25,860
Now, if yours are not, if yours are not the same as the diagram on your quad,

118
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,140
make them the same as the diagram on your quad.

119
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,320
If for some reason you wanted to reverse it, don't just think that that checkbox in the motors tab that I showed you,

120
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,280
the little toggle slider, will reverse your motor directions.

121
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,680
It actually doesn't do anything for the motor direction.

122
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,460
It just tells the flight controller what to expect.

123
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,980
So don't go messing with that, just make your props match.

124
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:50,960
Now, once you have made your props match, there's still a potential that it doesn't work.

125
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,860
And that might be because of something called motor direction,

126
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,000
which, if you built the quad, hopefully you know what the motor direction is.

127
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,440
Hopefully you've already set it.

128
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,700
But now is the time to go back through the motor direction wizard in Betaflight.

129
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,500
If changing the props around didn't get the thing to lift off the ground,

130
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,180
and you're not for some reason in flip over after crash mode,

131
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,620
and you've made sure that your props aren't on upside down,

132
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,060
but the quad is just not coming up off the ground,

133
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,460
it's time to check the motor direction and see what that does.

134
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,440
And the first part of checking your motor direction,

135
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,380
take the freaking props off your quad,

136
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,740
because you want to keep your fingers, don't you?

137
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,820
You like your little meat tube sticks?

138
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,240
You want to keep them.

139
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,180
So let's take them off there, because there will be a pack plugged in for this.

140
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,760
And back in the motors tab with the LiPo plugged into our quad,

141
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,760
as well as the USB,

142
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,060
we can go to this motor direction button here.

143
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,640
And that's going to pop up this thing.

144
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,420
Yes, I understand the wrist.

145
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,740
All propellers are removed,

146
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:51,420
because you listened to me a minute ago about keeping your sausage tubies intact, correct?

147
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,160
So we're going to check that.

148
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,860
And then I like to do individually.

149
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,160
So I'm going to go individually.

150
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,820
And what this will let me do is basically just pick a motor number,

151
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,640
and it'll spin on the quad.

152
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,120
And so when I press 1 in Betaflight, you can see that motor spins.

153
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,840
And this is a really small quad.

154
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,780
So what I'm actually going to do to check the direction

155
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,920
is press that and then feel the direction it's spinning.

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,940
And mine feels it's pulling my finger outward.

157
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,320
That means my motor direction is correct.

158
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,160
And if the motor direction is correct, you don't have to do anything.

159
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,960
You can just move on to the next motor.

160
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,400
But if the motor direction is not correct, you can either set it to normal or reverse.

161
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,820
And when you press those buttons, it will actually reverse it in real time.

162
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,660
So that is reversed for this motor, which is actually the wrong direction.

163
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,400
So I'm going to go back and hit the normal button.

164
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,780
And now I can feel it pulling to the outside again.

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,900
And that is the correct motor direction.

166
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,820
And once you have all them done, you just have to hit close.

167
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,860
And it actually saves it all for you right there.

168
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,020
And that's it.

169
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,920
There's a very good likelihood that you have now fixed the problem.

170
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,480
So now you can put your props back on in the correct direction and go see if it did.

171
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,080
Now, if you were doing this whole thing and you went around the motors

172
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,100
with the motor direction wizard or individually like I did,

173
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,280
and you noticed that one of the motors was not spinning, that's a bad sign.

174
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,060
That could be a problem with either your ESC or the harness

175
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,720
from your flight controller to the ESC or if it's an all-in-one board,

176
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,320
either the all-in-one board or the motor.

177
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:21,340
So then it's time to dive off into some other troubleshooting

178
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,980
that we're not going to get into in this video.

179
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,340
But that is a great time to notice when you have a problem

180
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,660
with the actual spinny boys because they should all be able to spin.

181
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,800
But now you should be able to go put the props on

182
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,680
and at least get the thing off the ground.

183
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,900
Thanks, problem number four.

184
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,600
That was incredibly helpful, right?

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,340
Well, if it was helpful, be sure to give this video a thumbs up.

186
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,600
And yeah, subscribe if you feel like it.

187
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,220
If not, I'll keep it greasy anyway and maybe someday you'll feel like it.

188
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,600
But let's roll right on to item number five,

189
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,400
which causes the actual freak out flip out thing

190
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,860
that I showed you at the very beginning.

191
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,340
And that is board orientation because yes,

192
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,260
flight controllers do have a direction.

193
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,640
The gyros on the flight controllers are oriented in a way

194
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,360
which it basically knows where forward is.

195
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,280
And all flight controllers have this handy dandy little arrow somewhere.

196
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,840
It doesn't always look the same.

197
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,220
Depends on the manufacturer.

198
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,060
As long as it isn't like, you know, phallic, you're all good.

199
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,440
Hopefully it looks like an arrow and not that thing.

200
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,860
Anyway, find it.

201
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,680
Make sure it's facing the front of the quad.

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,640
If it's not facing the front of the quad,

203
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,020
then that means you probably have the wrong board orientation.

204
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,660
Another way to get the wrong board orientation is to flash your quad

205
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,900
because sometimes when you flash your quad,

206
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,680
things don't get applied properly.

207
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:49,520
And you'll be surprised that not all manufacturers point the gyro directly at the front

208
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,220
the same direction of the arrow as you would think.

209
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
For instance, this is a Darwin 15 amp AIO.

210
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,860
And although I have the arrow facing forward,

211
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,220
I haven't done anything funny with this board.

212
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,820
It's actually set in the tab I'm going to show you in a second as a 90 degree offset.

213
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,520
That just means that the manufacturer expects it's already 90 degrees in the wrong direction

214
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,900
when they made it.

215
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,460
So if it doesn't say the right thing, you'll get a flipping quad.

216
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,380
So let's go over to the configuration tab and I'll show you where to find this setting.

217
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,680
And here in the configuration tab, you can see the first gyro and the pulldown.

218
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,680
Mine is set to clockwise 90, which means the gyro is set 90 degrees.

219
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,800
That's 90 degrees to the clockwise direction off from center.

220
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,960
There's also a counterclockwise 90.

221
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,860
There's flip orientations.

222
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,400
There's all kinds of orientations in here.

223
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,320
But how do you know which one is correct?

224
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,360
Well, you got to turn this thing on.

225
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,640
And that would be the accelerometer because the only way to validate this,

226
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,340
the way I'm going to show you is to use your accelerometer.

227
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,320
So if that's already on, you're good.

228
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,540
I always turn mine off.

229
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,800
So I just turned mine on.

230
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,560
I saved it.

231
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,420
I rebooted it.

232
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
And let's get back in.

233
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,180
And I will show you where to go to determine if your board orientation is correct or not.

234
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,560
And that will be the setup tab where we get this handy dandy little graph.

235
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,880
And what we're going to be looking for is when we turn the quad on its yaw axis,

236
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:19,740
the little picture turns appropriately with the yaw axis.

237
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,560
When we turn on the pitch axis, the picture turns appropriately on the pitch axis.

238
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,600
When we turn on the roll axis, the same thing.

239
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,560
It turns appropriately.

240
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,320
Now, you'll notice that mine turned appropriately.

241
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,140
That's because mine is set correctly.

242
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:36,480
But if yours isn't set correctly, it may look something like this.

243
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,400
So this is actually me pitching up.

244
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,500
And you can see how it's actually using the roll axis.

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,040
And I'm yawing.

246
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,020
And it's not getting that axis at all.

247
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,420
It is super weird.

248
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm doing this.

249
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,160
And the quad basically isn't doing anything appropriate.

250
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,420
And that's because my board orientation is wrong.

251
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,900
And the flight controller has no idea which direction the gyro is actually turning.

252
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,600
Because, I mean, the gyro is not saying left, right, forward, backward.

253
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,160
It's saying so many degrees per second in whatever axis.

254
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,540
So we have to deem the axis.

255
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,480
And the only way to do that is with board orientation.

256
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,540
So what you'll want to do is go into the board orientation, kind of get a feel for it in this setup tab.

257
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,080
Get a feel for what's wrong.

258
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,840
Maybe you realize that roll is exactly backwards.

259
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,440
Well, then you'll kind of have an idea of what you need to do.

260
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:32,460
It might be if you're at a CW0 or clockwise zero, meaning it's no offset at all, you need to go to a clockwise 180.

261
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,640
And it will be exactly backwards.

262
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,700
If the board is upside down, you may need to add a flip.

263
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,280
You just need to mess with it and try some settings until it responds correctly.

264
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,960
Or you can go find a config dump from the manufacturer and try to see what the field looks like for this.

265
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,580
It's completely up to you.

266
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,360
I've had to do it both ways.

267
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:57,120
In fact, with this quad, when I first built it, the board didn't have it at all.

268
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:04,040
Which was weird, even though I had flashed it with the presets and defaults, it didn't have an orientation at all.

269
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,340
So this quad freaked out when I first built it.

270
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,460
But sometimes it's just some trial and error.

271
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,480
Use the picture in the accelerometer to get you to the right place.

272
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,780
Just poke around at it until you can get the right thing.

273
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,660
Or try to make sense of what exactly is wrong and determine clockwise, counterclockwise, 90, 180, what you need to do to correct it.

274
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,580
And now for the last problem.

275
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,960
The news you absolutely never want to hear.

276
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,560
Or you did something wrong when you built it.

277
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,860
Because it's entirely possible.

278
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,100
But let me put some concessions around this.

279
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,840
The whole thing where it flips over, that's usually a board orientation problem or a motor direction problem.

280
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,920
The whole thing where it doesn't take off from the ground, that's usually a prop orientation problem.

281
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,420
Or a mode problem.

282
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,380
Sometimes a motor direction problem.

283
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,740
The things that I talked about on the bench when you're testing where it shuts down or it doesn't throttle down.

284
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,660
That's completely normal operation.

285
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,740
This last one is when it tries to take off.

286
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,000
So you get the quad, right?

287
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,520
Your happy little brand new built quad.

288
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
It's so fresh, ungreased.

289
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,280
You get it.

290
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,300
You take off.

291
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,020
It hovers.

292
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,140
Maybe it sounds a little funny.

293
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,720
Normally this is preceded by sound a little funny.

294
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,820
You might be too new to the hobby to know what the sound sounds like.

295
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,800
If your quad sounds like a swarm of pissed off bees, there's something wrong.

296
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,260
If it's surging up and down, if the motor is surging up and down, if you can audibly hear the surging, there's something wrong.

297
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,640
And usually what's wrong is mechanical failure.

298
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,660
So either the frame has some kind of crack in it or it's not properly assembled and things aren't tight.

299
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,300
That's entirely possible.

300
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,060
So as you throttle up higher, it takes off to the moon.

301
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,700
And then you may never see your quad again.

302
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,300
Yay, brand new quad.

303
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,480
Just flew 400 feet in the air.

304
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,340
Yes, FAA, just 400 feet.

305
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,640
And you will no longer see it ever again.

306
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,280
Maybe.

307
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:01,000
Hopefully, Betaflight catches it and shuts it down or you hit that disarm switch fast enough.

308
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,000
But that is what we call a flyaway.

309
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,440
And usually a flyaway is because the quad is under filtered.

310
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,620
What do I mean by that?

311
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,940
Well, noise getting back to the gyro is causing this feedback loop of oscillation and it goes crazy.

312
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,880
And then it has no choice but to just throttle the motors up because it is in a complete freakout mode and it shoots off to nowhere.

313
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,360
That does happen.

314
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:32,200
But usually that is because of a frame problem, a build problem, or just a really terrible tune that has too much gain or not enough filtering.

315
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,860
And none of those things I can help you with on this video because those are things you have to kind of do with a fine tooth comb.

316
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,600
What I would recommend you do is take a really, really good look at your frame.

317
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,080
Sometimes you don't see the damage.

318
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,980
Sometimes it's what's called a delamination, which means there's no actually visible crack.

319
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:58,600
You just kind of have to wiggle it around and pay a lot of attention and do a lot of looking and tightening and everything you can do to make sure it's buttoned up.

320
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,220
And then maybe it's a tune problem.

321
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,740
And you might be running Betaflight defaults.

322
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:10,780
There's a good chance if you're running Betaflight defaults that it won't do this because of the tune because it's a little over filtered out of the box anyway.

323
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,320
And Betaflight defaults are fairly conservative, although they fly pretty well.

324
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Now, if you flashed a preset to it, it might be a little too hot for your build there, buddy.

325
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:20,940
It might be.

326
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,680
And it might be what's causing your fly away.

327
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,580
So what I'd recommend is go back to the Betaflight defaults.

328
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:33,520
Your maiden flight should probably always be on the Betaflight defaults so that you can nearly guarantee you're going to keep your quad after your maiden flight.

329
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,560
But if it tries to fly away on you, that is the most likely cause.

330
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:46,520
Either mechanical problems with the build or damage to the build or filtering problems that are causing the pit gains to go crazy.

331
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,020
Maybe you have too much pit gain as well.

332
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,000
That can do it too.

333
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,480
Normally, it's a D-gain problem.

334
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,160
You'll have very hot motors when you do find your quad and it won't be very happy.

335
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,560
But hopefully you find it because it's your new, now more greasy than it was, baby.

336
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,100
Right?

337
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,080
Yeah.

338
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:09,680
Anyway, that's the six reasons that this normally happens to people and I see it all the time.

339
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,180
If it's happened to you, go down to the comments below and let me know what you found yours out to be.

340
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,100
Did you just put the props on wrong?

341
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,300
There's no shame in that.

342
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,580
We aren't going to shame you for it.

343
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:22,400
I promise.

344
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:23,600
We won't.

345
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,880
I've done it too.

346
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:33,420
I actually, that seven inch back there, did nothing but flip over on itself for the first week after I flashed new version of Metaflight on it.

347
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,840
So, yeah.

348
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,760
It does happen.

349
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,080
So, go down there and tell me how yours went.

350
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,260
Did it fly away on you?

351
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,120
Did it flip over and go crazy?

352
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,020
And what did you find the issue to be?

353
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,860
I'd really be interested to know because I see this literally all the time, especially in beginner forums.

354
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,720
And I hope it was helpful.

355
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,800
I hope that your quad stops doing that.

356
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,160
And I hope that you don't feel like a crazy person that doesn't know what they're doing.

357
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,320
Because it's perfectly fine and common to have these issues happen.

358
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,480
We are all human beings.

359
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,660
Quads are crazy.

360
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,260
And they're going to do what they're going to do.

361
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,540
Quads going to quad, man.

362
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,660
Quads going to quad.

363
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,120
And that means sometimes that's going to happen.

364
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,120
That's just the way the prop crumbles.

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,120
Hopefully yours don't.

366
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,280
Because that will be an even bigger problem what we're talking about here.

367
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,980
Anyway, until next time, stay greasy.

368
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,240
Flip your quads over.

369
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,540
And I'll catch you later.

370
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,460
Hello, I'm Vick and Ninja.

371
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,640
My teeth feel a little funny today.

372
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,500
They're a little bit brighter than usual.

373
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,400
And, oh, god, they're scratching my gums.

374
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,820
I can't do it.

375
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,520
Scratching my gums.

376
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,820
Gross.

377
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:38,500
Ugh.

378
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,520
Tasted like grass and shame.

379
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,120
Ugh.

380
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,140
Ugh.

381
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,700
You're at seaery.

382
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:43,960
Shh.

383
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,660
Winds.
