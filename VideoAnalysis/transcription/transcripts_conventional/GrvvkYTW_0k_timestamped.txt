[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:08.040] Hi, I'm James, the Bald Engineer. Both of these are transistors. One is a BJT and the other is a
[00:00:08.040 → 00:00:13.220] MOSFET. Can you tell the difference? If not, that's okay, because in this Atoms video, we're going to
[00:00:13.220 → 00:00:18.180] take a look at MOSFETs, how they work, and how you can use them in your circuits. So let's get going.
[00:00:30.000 → 00:00:34.960] This video is part of a two-part series on transistors. The previous one covered bipolar
[00:00:34.960 → 00:00:43.200] junction transistors, BJTs, while this video covers metal oxide semiconductor field effect
[00:00:43.200 → 00:00:51.700] transistors, known as MOSFETs. Generally, you'll use a BJT for small loads, say less than 1 amp of
[00:00:51.700 → 00:00:56.440] current, while MOSFETs are well suited for applications with much higher current. For the
[00:00:56.440 → 00:01:02.800] video on BJTs, see atoms.com slash ep10. For now, let's move on to MOSFETs.
[00:01:04.180 → 00:01:09.280] MOS is a flowerless plant that typically grows 1 to 10 centimeters. Some mosses grow up to 50
[00:01:09.280 → 00:01:16.840] centimeters and can be commonly found on trees. Wait a minute, this is the wrong script. Hold on,
[00:01:17.400 → 00:01:22.520] the tree sounds right. Okay, here's the other stuff. Okay, let's try this again.
[00:01:22.520 → 00:01:31.120] MOSFETs belong to a family tree of field effect transistors, or known as FETs. There are JFETs,
[00:01:31.420 → 00:01:37.820] MOSFETs, and IGBTs. JFETs actually work a little bit like a BJT, which we've already talked about.
[00:01:38.760 → 00:01:44.560] For this video, we're focused on the MOSFET, which has two types of modes, called depletion and
[00:01:44.560 → 00:01:52.160] enhancement. A depletion mode MOSFET works like a normally closed switch. Current can flow
[00:01:52.160 → 00:01:59.880] when no voltage is applied. Applying a negative voltage actually causes the current flow to stop.
[00:02:00.960 → 00:02:07.380] An enhancement mode FET works like a variable resistor. They come in N-channel and P-channel types.
[00:02:09.000 → 00:02:14.480] Enhancement mode FETs are by far the most common transistor used today, so let's focus in on them.
[00:02:14.480 → 00:02:23.560] Here's the symbol for an N-channel enhancement mode MOSFET, and here's a TO220 style transistor.
[00:02:24.760 → 00:02:30.140] The pins of a MOSFET are identified as the gate, the drain, and the source.
[00:02:31.220 → 00:02:39.200] The field effect part of their name suggests they work by voltage, compared to a BJT, which works by current.
[00:02:39.200 → 00:02:49.120] When voltage is applied between the gate and the source, current is allowed to flow between the drain and the source.
[00:02:51.280 → 00:02:57.200] Here's the really cool thing about MOSFETs. They are variable resistors controlled by voltage,
[00:02:58.060 → 00:03:01.180] which means depending on the voltage applied between the gate and source,
[00:03:01.560 → 00:03:04.260] the resistance between the drain and source will vary.
[00:03:04.260 → 00:03:10.420] With a low voltage at the gate, the resistance from the drain to source is very high.
[00:03:11.040 → 00:03:12.640] It's kind of like an open switch.
[00:03:14.320 → 00:03:18.500] As we increase the voltage at the gate, we pass a threshold voltage,
[00:03:19.000 → 00:03:24.320] and then the resistance from the drain to the source drops, and it drops very quickly.
[00:03:25.320 → 00:03:31.720] The key difference between a MOSFET and a BJT is that the output current isn't a multiplier of the input,
[00:03:31.720 → 00:03:35.940] because MOSFETs are all about voltage.
[00:03:38.180 → 00:03:43.020] Since the resistance is between the drain and source, it is known as RDS-ON,
[00:03:43.560 → 00:03:46.280] and can always be found in the MOSFETs datasheet.
[00:03:47.120 → 00:03:52.300] For example, this is a FQP30N06L.
[00:03:52.860 → 00:03:55.540] Let's take a look at its datasheet from Fairchild.
[00:03:55.540 → 00:04:00.760] We can see that RDS is given when there are two different voltages from gate to source.
[00:04:01.440 → 00:04:05.220] At 10 volts, the on resistance will be about 27 milliohms,
[00:04:05.800 → 00:04:10.560] and while at 5 volts, the on resistance is only about 35 milliohms.
[00:04:11.200 → 00:04:12.820] That's pretty small when you think about it.
[00:04:14.180 → 00:04:16.880] We picked this MOSFET on purpose.
[00:04:16.880 → 00:04:20.080] It is known as a logic-level MOSFET,
[00:04:20.780 → 00:04:25.460] because the voltage from gate to source, VGS, is lower than 5 volts.
[00:04:26.360 → 00:04:31.960] In other words, the threshold to turn the MOSFET on is low enough to be used by an Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
[00:04:32.940 → 00:04:35.540] Not all MOSFETs are logic-level compatible,
[00:04:35.960 → 00:04:41.400] so it is very important to check to see what the VGS threshold is before using it in your circuit.
[00:04:41.400 → 00:04:45.780] Since you will probably use a MOSFET in high-current applications,
[00:04:46.060 → 00:04:48.860] it is important to check how hot it is going to get.
[00:04:49.580 → 00:04:52.160] Here's how we calculate if we need a heatsink or not.
[00:04:53.200 → 00:04:59.240] The formula to determine how much power the MOSFET dissipates is resistance times current squared.
[00:05:00.360 → 00:05:03.380] In this case, the resistance is RDS on,
[00:05:03.680 → 00:05:06.120] and the current is whatever your load will draw.
[00:05:07.020 → 00:05:10.220] Let's use an example of a motor that draws 1 amp of current.
[00:05:11.400 → 00:05:17.300] This means we multiply 35 milliohms by 1 amp squared to get 35 milliwatts.
[00:05:18.080 → 00:05:20.900] Okay, now we need a few more things from the datasheet.
[00:05:22.020 → 00:05:26.480] First, we need the junction to ambient coefficient, which is R theta J A,
[00:05:26.940 → 00:05:30.540] and in this case is 62.5 degrees C per watt.
[00:05:31.460 → 00:05:34.380] We also need the maximum junction temperature,
[00:05:34.380 → 00:05:37.680] which in this case is 175 degrees C.
[00:05:37.680 → 00:05:43.760] Using this formula, we can calculate the maximum power the transistor can dissipate
[00:05:43.760 → 00:05:46.240] without using a heatsink.
[00:05:47.240 → 00:05:51.260] We take the maximum junction temperature minus the ambient temperature,
[00:05:51.580 → 00:05:53.420] which is going to be 25 degrees C,
[00:05:53.900 → 00:05:55.600] and divide by the thermal resistance.
[00:05:56.360 → 00:05:59.980] This gives a maximum dissipation of 2.4 watts.
[00:05:59.980 → 00:06:04.160] In our example, we are only dissipating 35 milliwatts,
[00:06:04.160 → 00:06:06.460] so we're safe to operate without a heatsink.
[00:06:08.360 → 00:06:09.960] Now, you might be wondering,
[00:06:10.180 → 00:06:13.240] how can the number we calculate be 2.4 watts,
[00:06:13.600 → 00:06:16.400] when the datasheet clearly said 79 watts?
[00:06:16.940 → 00:06:18.400] And that's a really great point.
[00:06:18.400 → 00:06:26.400] The 79 watts is if we had the ability to cool the transistor's case to 25 degrees C,
[00:06:26.960 → 00:06:30.160] which means you have to be using some kind of heatsink.
[00:06:30.740 → 00:06:33.220] But we're going to cover more on that in a later video.
[00:06:34.280 → 00:06:37.520] Let's review what you need to know to use a MOSFET as a switch.
[00:06:38.000 → 00:06:41.180] Number one, find out which pin is the gate, drain, and source.
[00:06:41.820 → 00:06:45.700] Number two, look at the datasheet to determine the threshold voltage,
[00:06:45.700 → 00:06:49.140] which is going to be shown as VGS or VTH.
[00:06:50.340 → 00:06:53.920] Find the drain-to-source resistance or RDS on.
[00:06:54.580 → 00:06:57.160] Number four, look at R theta, JA,
[00:06:57.740 → 00:07:01.940] and the maximum junction temperature to calculate how hot the MOSFET will get.
