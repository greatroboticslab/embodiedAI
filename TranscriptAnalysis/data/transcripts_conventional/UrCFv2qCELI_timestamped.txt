[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:09.460] Resistance, reactance, and impedance. You've likely encountered these terms before, but do you truly understand their significance?
[00:00:10.120 → 00:00:13.240] Let's unravel the mysteries behind these concepts.
[00:00:14.860 → 00:00:22.900] When we apply a voltage difference across a conductor connected to a light bulb using any kind of power supply, the light bulb will turn on.
[00:00:23.680 → 00:00:27.560] Let's represent the voltages at the two ends of the circuit using a scale like this.
[00:00:27.560 → 00:00:34.560] When the voltage is equal on both sides, A and B, the light will not turn on because no current flows.
[00:00:35.120 → 00:00:38.920] Let's set the A end to zero volts and increase the voltage at the B end.
[00:00:40.000 → 00:00:44.580] If the voltage at B exceeds that of A, current will flow from B to A.
[00:00:51.820 → 00:00:57.120] Conversely, if the voltage at B drops below that of A, current will flow from A to B.
[00:00:57.560 → 00:01:10.620] When the voltage difference between A and B remains constant, we call it direct current.
[00:01:10.620 → 00:01:21.240] When the voltage varies, and current changes in magnitude and direction frequently, we refer to it as alternating current.
[00:01:23.860 → 00:01:28.640] To gain a better understanding of these two types of currents, we can graph voltage and current.
[00:01:28.640 → 00:01:35.140] In DC circuits, voltage remains constant, resulting in a constant current.
[00:01:40.140 → 00:01:42.740] To simplify, we'll overlay both charts.
[00:01:42.740 → 00:01:51.980] In AC circuits, voltage varies in a sine wave pattern, causing the current to follow the same pattern.
[00:01:57.380 → 00:02:00.720] Again, for clarity, we'll overlay both charts.
[00:02:00.720 → 00:02:07.320] Having a solid grasp of these two types of currents is essential as we move forward.
[00:02:09.720 → 00:02:11.720] This is a current conducting wire.
[00:02:12.120 → 00:02:15.640] For example, let's assume it conducts the alternating current.
[00:02:16.520 → 00:02:20.000] When we connect electronic components to this current-carrying wire,
[00:02:20.400 → 00:02:24.100] they have the power to influence and modify the behavior of the current.
[00:02:24.100 → 00:02:33.300] In a DC circuit, each component connected to the current path impedes the movement of electrons,
[00:02:33.760 → 00:02:35.800] resulting in a decrease in current flow.
[00:02:36.800 → 00:02:40.220] This phenomenon also occurs in AC circuits.
[00:02:40.740 → 00:02:46.480] A component can hinder electron flow, causing a reduction in current, much like in a DC circuit.
[00:02:46.480 → 00:02:52.540] However, it's important to note that in AC circuits, current typically follows the voltage,
[00:02:52.900 → 00:02:55.280] increasing and decreasing in sync with it.
[00:02:57.280 → 00:03:01.240] But that's not the sole way current behavior changes in AC circuits.
[00:03:01.680 → 00:03:04.920] As voltage changes, some components resist the change,
[00:03:05.280 → 00:03:08.440] causing the current to not strictly follow voltage fluctuations.
[00:03:08.440 → 00:03:16.640] Conversely, others accelerate the current changes,
[00:03:17.120 → 00:03:21.260] further complicating the relationship between voltage and current in AC circuits.
[00:03:24.940 → 00:03:28.320] We have now discussed three types of current changes in a circuit,
[00:03:28.720 → 00:03:33.500] and these changes depend on whether the type of current flowing through the circuit is AC or DC.
[00:03:34.260 → 00:03:37.560] The first type involves simply decreasing the magnitude of current,
[00:03:37.560 → 00:03:40.940] and it can be observed in both DC and AC circuits.
[00:03:41.500 → 00:03:45.440] In this scenario, current and voltage changes occur simultaneously.
[00:03:46.200 → 00:03:50.860] The second type entails current changes occurring after some time following a voltage change.
[00:03:51.440 → 00:03:56.740] This phenomenon is unique to AC circuits since in DC circuits, voltage remains constant.
[00:03:57.280 → 00:04:00.560] The third type involves current changing before a voltage change,
[00:04:00.780 → 00:04:03.400] and it is also exclusive to AC systems.
[00:04:03.400 → 00:04:09.540] We say the first type of current change to the resistance of a component.
[00:04:09.540 → 00:04:14.200] The second and third types of changes occur due to the reactants of the components.
[00:04:14.880 → 00:04:19.700] More specifically, inductive reactants causes the current to lag behind the voltage,
[00:04:20.020 → 00:04:23.460] while capacitive reactants causes the current to lead the voltage.
[00:04:23.460 → 00:04:27.100] Now let's discuss resistance and reactants.
[00:04:27.100 → 00:04:29.640] To gain a better understanding of these concepts,
[00:04:29.980 → 00:04:34.100] we need to explore the behavior of resistors, inductors, and capacitors.
[00:04:34.680 → 00:04:37.720] Let's try to grasp these concepts using a water analogy.
[00:04:38.500 → 00:04:43.500] Here we have two pistons, each half filled with water, and both connected using a water pipe.
[00:04:43.500 → 00:04:49.800] If we apply a constant pushing force to piston A, the water will begin to flow from piston A to piston B.
[00:04:50.480 → 00:04:54.420] This happens because the applied force increases the water pressure in piston A,
[00:04:54.900 → 00:04:58.960] prompting the water to move from the high-pressure region to the low-pressure region.
[00:04:59.520 → 00:05:01.940] The same phenomenon occurs in an electric circuit.
[00:05:02.560 → 00:05:05.460] A battery has two terminals, positive and negative.
[00:05:05.880 → 00:05:10.300] The positive terminal has a high potential, while the negative terminal has a low potential.
[00:05:10.300 → 00:05:13.800] When we connect these two terminals using a conductor wire,
[00:05:14.220 → 00:05:17.560] a current begins to flow from the positive side to the negative side.
[00:05:18.140 → 00:05:19.920] Let's return to the water piston example.
[00:05:20.480 → 00:05:24.840] If we modify the applied force, the water flow will also change accordingly.
[00:05:25.460 → 00:05:28.760] We can represent the applied force and the water flow in graphs.
[00:05:29.440 → 00:05:33.960] When the pushing force decreases, the water flow from A to B also decreases.
[00:05:34.540 → 00:05:36.540] If we apply a pulling force to the piston,
[00:05:36.980 → 00:05:39.740] it can be represented in the graph as a negative force.
[00:05:39.740 → 00:05:42.580] We can see the water flow from B to A.
[00:05:43.060 → 00:05:47.300] To provide a clearer perspective, let's combine these two graphs like this.
[00:05:47.980 → 00:05:51.240] This water analogy serves as an analogy for AC circuits.
[00:05:52.820 → 00:05:58.460] Now, let's examine the impact on water flow when different types of components are connected to the water path.
[00:05:59.660 → 00:06:00.680] Here's our setup.
[00:06:00.680 → 00:06:07.380] We are applying a constant force to piston A, resulting in a steady water flow in the pipe.
[00:06:07.900 → 00:06:10.900] Now, what happens if we connect a narrow nozzle to the water pipe?
[00:06:11.360 → 00:06:12.560] It's quite straightforward.
[00:06:13.160 → 00:06:18.260] If the force remains the same as before, the narrow nozzle decreases the water flow in the pipe.
[00:06:18.260 → 00:06:27.020] Whether the force remains stable or changes direction, the reduction in water flow is noticeable in both scenarios.
[00:06:27.720 → 00:06:31.200] The same principle applies to an electrical circuit when we connect a resistor.
[00:06:31.800 → 00:06:34.140] The resistor diminishes the current flow through it.
[00:06:34.140 → 00:06:43.420] As we mentioned at the beginning of this video, resistance opposes the flow of current and is present in both AC and DC circuits.
[00:06:44.840 → 00:06:49.220] Here we have a water wheel connected to the water pipe, blocking the water's path.
[00:06:49.220 → 00:06:53.680] To initiate water flow, the wheel must begin to rotate.
[00:06:59.680 → 00:07:03.280] Let's illustrate this with a graph of the applied force and water flow.
[00:07:04.000 → 00:07:08.580] Initially, there is no force on the piston, resulting in no current flow through the pipe.
[00:07:10.480 → 00:07:15.740] When we suddenly increase the force on the piston, the water flow cannot immediately increase.
[00:07:16.120 → 00:07:18.200] It needs to set the wheel in motion first.
[00:07:18.200 → 00:07:23.260] Consequently, the wheel starts to rotate, gradually increasing the water flow.
[00:07:23.820 → 00:07:25.940] After a while, it reaches a constant speed.
[00:07:26.560 → 00:07:31.720] If we abruptly stop the force while the wheel is still turning, the wheel will attempt to maintain its rotation,
[00:07:32.160 → 00:07:39.560] causing the water flow to persist for a moment before gradually decreasing and eventually coming to a halt due to friction within the pipe.
[00:07:39.560 → 00:07:52.400] This behavior arises from the inertia of the water wheel, which strives to maintain a constant rotational speed.
[00:07:53.180 → 00:07:56.060] From this, we observe some interesting characteristics.
[00:07:56.780 → 00:07:59.440] The water wheel delays the increase in water flow.
[00:07:59.920 → 00:08:02.400] The water wheel delays the decrease in water flow.
[00:08:02.400 → 00:08:09.100] When the force remains constant, the water wheel does not impact water flow, behaving like an ordinary pipe.
[00:08:09.820 → 00:08:14.760] When the force changes continuously, the water flow only responds after a delay.
[00:08:14.760 → 00:08:27.460] In general terms, we can say the water wheel resists abrupt changes in water flow.
[00:08:27.460 → 00:08:34.700] If the water flow is steady, the water wheel does not interfere with it.
[00:08:35.220 → 00:08:39.480] However, if the water flow attempts to change, the water wheel delays this change.
[00:08:39.480 → 00:08:44.300] This behavior parallels that of an inductor in an electrical circuit.
[00:08:45.120 → 00:08:51.040] In the case of direct current DC, where voltage remains constant, the inductor does not influence the current.
[00:08:51.780 → 00:08:57.880] However, in alternating current AC circuits, where voltage is always leading the current, this effect becomes evident.
[00:08:58.500 → 00:09:01.120] This phenomenon is known as inductive reactance.
[00:09:01.620 → 00:09:06.860] As we mentioned earlier in this video, inductive reactance does not like to change the current through it.
[00:09:06.860 → 00:09:11.340] Also, it is not observed in DC circuits because current remains constant.
[00:09:12.740 → 00:09:17.920] Here we have an elastic chamber connected to the water pipe, serving as a barrier between both sides.
[00:09:18.440 → 00:09:22.020] Water in side A cannot move to side B and vice versa.
[00:09:22.620 → 00:09:25.380] We'll color the water in side B using green dye.
[00:09:25.820 → 00:09:30.820] The colored water cannot mix with the water in side A due to the membrane's impermeability.
[00:09:30.820 → 00:09:38.860] However, since it's an elastic membrane, it can expand to a certain extent based on the water pressure difference between the two sides.
[00:09:39.640 → 00:09:44.060] When we apply a pushing force to piston A, the membrane expands, as shown.
[00:09:44.740 → 00:09:49.340] However, the water flow stops when the opposing elastic force equals the applied force.
[00:09:50.140 → 00:09:53.820] We can graph the applied force and water flow like this.
[00:09:53.820 → 00:09:58.220] When the applied force is constant, no water flows through the pipe.
[00:09:59.300 → 00:10:04.000] But when the force changes, we observe water flowing through the pipe like this.
[00:10:04.000 → 00:10:19.320] It appears that the water flow must change before the force changes.
[00:10:22.120 → 00:10:29.320] In general terms, we can say that the elastic membrane tends to influence water flow changes to delay force changes.
[00:10:29.960 → 00:10:32.580] In this example, the water flow is leading the voltage.
[00:10:32.580 → 00:10:38.120] If the force remains constant, no water flows through the pipe.
[00:10:38.560 → 00:10:42.580] However, if the force changes, the water flow leads the force.
[00:10:47.260 → 00:10:52.220] This behavior closely mirrors how a capacitor operates in an electrical circuit.
[00:10:52.800 → 00:10:58.280] In direct current, where the voltage is constant, the capacitor does not allow current to pass through.
[00:10:58.280 → 00:11:02.460] But in alternating current, current consistently leads voltage.
[00:11:03.120 → 00:11:06.680] This phenomenon is referred to as capacitive reactance.
[00:11:07.260 → 00:11:13.820] As we mentioned at the beginning of this video, capacitive reactance is not observed when the voltage remains stable.
[00:11:14.520 → 00:11:20.420] Since current does not change in DC circuits, capacitive reactance is not evident in DC circuits.
[00:11:20.420 → 00:11:26.540] Now that we understand how different types of components affect the current in a circuit,
[00:11:26.540 → 00:11:34.140] The three primary factors influencing current are resistance, inductive reactance, and capacitive reactance.
[00:11:34.720 → 00:11:40.440] Resistance consistently decreases the current and is observable in both AC and DC circuits.
[00:11:41.180 → 00:11:44.880] Inductive reactance causes the current in a circuit to lag behind the voltage,
[00:11:44.880 → 00:11:48.040] And it's exclusively observable in AC circuits.
[00:11:48.780 → 00:11:52.500] Conversely, capacitive reactance makes the current lead the voltage,
[00:11:52.860 → 00:11:55.840] And it, too, can only be observed in AC circuits.
[00:11:56.260 → 00:12:00.340] The cumulative effect of these factors is referred to as impedance.
[00:12:01.300 → 00:12:06.900] In simple terms, impedance of a component signifies how it modifies the current within a circuit.
[00:12:06.900 → 00:12:10.660] That's all for today.
