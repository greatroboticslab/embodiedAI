00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
A few weeks ago, Mark Roper released a video showing these really cool zipline drones that

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:10,260
deliver medical supplies in Rwanda. As cool as this is, he kind of glossed over one of the most

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,760
interesting features of these drones. Look at these propellers. He mentions that they're shaped like

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:21,160
that to reduce the noise, but why does this happen? And what is it about the shape that reduces the

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,040
noise? The internet right now is just buzzing, waiting for someone to make a 3D printable version

6
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,540
of these to see how much quieter they actually are. And that's exactly what I have here. But before

7
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,600
we listen to these, let me explain why these propellers are shaped this way in the first place.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:42,000
What actually makes sound when a propeller spins really fast? Well, as the blades move past by a

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,480
stationary point, it creates a pressure disturbance that propagates away from the blade. The frequency

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,120
that this happens is called the blade passage frequency, and it's equal to the rotational

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,500
frequency, so how fast the propeller's spinning, times the number of blades on the propeller. So

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,920
let's say that we have a propeller that has four blades. The traditional way to make these is to

13
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
space them evenly so that they're 90 degrees apart. When you have a propeller shaped like this, it creates

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,020
a lot of different frequencies, but it creates a loud frequency at the blade passage frequency, but also

15
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,240
it creates frequencies at the harmonics of the blade passage frequency. So if you take an audio recording

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,140
of this, you'll see peaks at the whole number multiples of the blade passage frequency. But

17
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:28,240
something really interesting happens if you don't space out the blades evenly. So let's say instead

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,900
of having the blades spaced 90 degrees apart, we space them 30 degrees apart only. So there's now a large

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,020
gap and then a small gap between them, so they aren't evenly spaced. Well then when you record the sound,

20
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,880
you get the normal harmonics like before with one, two, three times the blade passage frequency,

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,980
but you also get 0.5 times the blade passage frequency and 1.5 and 2.5. So for the same

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,480
acoustic energy, you're spreading out some of the sound into lower frequencies. The most important

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,980
frequency is the one that's generated, which has half the frequency of the blade passage frequency.

24
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:06,460
You can see this here. So first we'll start with this four blade propeller. I have these little

25
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,380
reflective strips on here so I can measure the RPM. So how many times per second that it's spinning

26
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:20,220
around in a circle? So we're at around 1200 RPM right now. So around 85 Hertz is one of the loudest

27
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:29,380
frequencies here. But now if I switch out these propellers to around a 30 degree propeller,

28
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:42,360
let's get it to the same RPM. So that's almost exactly the same RPM around 1200. The other one is around 1249.

29
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:52,200
So they're going the same speed now, but let's measure one of the loudest frequencies. So this is crazy.

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:59,200
We're going the same speed with four propellers, but the loudest frequency coming off here is half the

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,200
frequency of the propeller that has the evenly spaced blades. So it's picking up a lower frequency.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,700
The higher one is still there, but the energy is shared between the two frequencies. So what does that do for us?

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,600
Well, humans are less sensitive to low frequency sounds. So we perceive them as quieter than they actually are.

34
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:25,080
So what this means is that when you space the blades unevenly, it creates a lower frequency that we perceive as quieter.

35
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:32,940
And this fact has been known for a long time. For example, there are cooling fans and helicopter rotors that use uneven blade spacing.

36
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,280
But this design still doesn't quite look like the zip line design that we saw from Mark Rober's video.

37
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,200
Why is there this gap between the blades so that they're on different levels?

38
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:47,700
Well, when you have a propeller design like this, there's an interaction that happens where the blades overlap.

39
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,000
This causes a lot of broadband noise, meaning just a large spread of many frequencies through the spectrum.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,500
So any noise reduction that you gain with the uneven blade spacing gets canceled out with this broadband noise that's created.

41
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:07,760
But if you just get rid of that overlap by raising one of the blades a little bit higher than the other one, then the broadband noise just goes away.

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,840
So an easy way to create this is just to take two double blade propellers and stack them on top of each other.

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,160
So I've made two propellers here. These are taken from an FPV airplane propeller that I have.

44
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:23,700
Okay, so what I have here are two different spacings of blades stacked on top of each other.

45
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:31,700
And I put a little sticker on each of them so that I can measure the rotational rate, the RPMs as they're spinning to get them at the same RPM.

46
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,700
Okay, so I'm going to turn both of them on.

47
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,700
10,300 RPM.

48
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,700
And this one's at 10,000 RPM.

49
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
10,200 RPM.

50
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:55,700
So they're really close to the same RPM.

51
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Okay, let's listen to both of their sounds.

52
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:16,700
Now in front.

53
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:31,700
10,300 RPM.

54
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Now behind.

55
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:53,700
The high pitch tones are still there with this one, but they're a lot less because of the acoustic noise has been spread out to that lower frequency as well as the high one.

56
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Whereas this one has most of the high ones.

57
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,700
You can see that the uneven space blades have a noticeably lower tone than the evenly spaced one.

58
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,700
What that amounts to is that it sounds quieter and not quite as annoying as the regularly spaced one.

59
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:16,700
So Zipline has made a version of the uneven space blades, but instead of including the four blades, they just have the two of them with a counterbalance on the other side.

60
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,700
So it sounds like this.

61
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:29,700
Now mine isn't perfectly balanced, so it doesn't sound a lot quieter.

62
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,700
I'd love for someone to make a better version of this in real life that uses the same design as Zipline.

63
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,700
Also a few months ago, MIT came up with a propeller called the toroidal propeller.

64
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,700
This is the two blade version.

65
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,700
And then this is the three blade version.

66
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,700
This used a propeller in this shape that reduced the sound in a different way.

67
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:55,700
It actually reduced the vortices formed and slightly reduced the overall sound levels.

68
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:01,700
You can actually see what the flow looks like between a toroidal propeller and a regular one in this simulation here.

69
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:08,700
For the standard props, we see small detached tip vortices from the air rolling off the tip of the blades.

70
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,700
These contribute to the high buzz noise that's typical of quadcopter drones.

71
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,700
In the case of the toroidal props, this detached vortex is contained within the ring of the prop,

72
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,700
and the overall jet of air is much more coherent, so it's quieter.

73
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,700
So this will correlate to a reduced overall noise signature due to improved turbulent flow.

74
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:32,700
This simulation is done using real physics using the software from our sponsor for this video, SimScale,

75
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,700
the world's first cloud-native engineering simulation platform.

76
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:43,700
SimScale provides engineers and designers access to digital prototyping and simulation early in the design stage,

81
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,700
And thanks to them for sponsoring this video and providing these nice simulations.

82
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Now let's get back to the experiment.

83
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,700
One problem with this design is notice that with the four propellers,

84
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:25,700
at 1200 RPM we get around 3.1 miles per hour of wind coming off of it.

85
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,700
But at the same rotational frequency for the unevenly spaced propellers,

86
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,700
we're only getting like 2.5, 2.7 miles per hour.

87
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,700
So for the same rotational speed with the same weight, we get less wind coming off of it.

88
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Which means to get the same wind speed, you have to speed this one up a little bit faster.

89
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,700
But that doesn't actually hurt you sound wise.

90
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Because I can turn up the speed to match the four propeller ones.

91
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
Let's turn it up to get like 3.1.

92
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,700
So now I turn up the speed.

93
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:05,700
So overall you have to spin these a little bit faster than you would the evenly spaced blades.

94
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,700
So they're less efficient, but you still get the lower frequency,

95
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
even at the faster speeds to get the same wind speed.

96
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,700
So overall these still can be a little bit quieter sounding than the evenly spaced blades.

97
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,700
So what's interesting about this apparent noise reduction with uneven blade spacing,

98
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
is that it depends on the place where you're listening.

99
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,700
If you're behind the blades, then the noise reduction is worse for uneven spacing.

100
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:33,700
But when you're in front of the blades or in the same plane as the blade, it's actually better.

101
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,700
So this is actually beneficial for flyover noise for planes.

102
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Because when they're closest to you, you're in about the same plane as the blade above you, so it's quieter.

103
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,700
But unfortunately that means it would be worse for drones because everything's below the blades.

104
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,700
But I'm not sure how ziplines blades would sound on a drone.

105
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,700
Maybe someone will get a hold of the real blades and do a comparison on a drone.

106
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Also I got a lot of this information in this video from a paper on uneven blade spacing.

107
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,700
And I'll put a link to that paper in the description as well.

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
