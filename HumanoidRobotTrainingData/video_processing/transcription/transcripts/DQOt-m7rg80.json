transmitter you need to go in here and change your aux channels"}, {"start": 57.739999999999995, "end": 64.72, "text": "so on this one I actually have the upgraded firmware so it can do up to 10

just want to show you guys how to do it basically I want to hit both of these"}, {"start": 105.22, "end": 112.44, "text": "switches to arm so that was out of focus but basically to arm the quad I want to have to hit"}, {"start": 112.44, "end": 119.84, "text": "both of these switches I want both down to arm I want if only this one is down I want it to beep"}, {"start": 119.84, "end": 130.58, "text":

acro you got to start by changing channel five"}, {"start": 145.84, "end": 150.58, "text": "and six we're just going to pretend like those are the only two channels that exist here so I want"},

how it works"}, {"start": 183.9, "end": 190.06, "text": "there so this switch is full off full on so the throttle value or the the value is one thousand and two"}, {"start": 190.06, "end": 198.06,

it here in the transmitter we go into channel five and we want"}, {"start": 208.38, "end": 218.02, "text": "to set this to be switch a plus b okay and we want channel six to be on this switch so we're going to set that"}, {"start": 218.02, "end": 229.36, "text": "one to switch C so there we go and we don't want switch C to also be on channel eight I mean I guess"}, {"start": 229.36, "end": 235.84,

like that so those things will be controlling the switches are"}, {"start": 247.06, "end": 252.22, "text": "only going to affect channel five and six that doesn't actually affect anything if we don't set"}, {"start": 252.22, "end": 260.4, "text": "it up in beta flight so now that we have that set up with aux five and a and b you can see here that"}, {"start": 260.4, "end": 270.28, "text": "when we

not beeper"}, {"start": 323.74, "end": 332.14, "text": "and not and and armed so those are the only three states that we're really looking for so let's go ahead"}, {"start": 332.14, "end":

just gonna connect up and you can see if"}, {"start": 364.02, "end": 372.44, "text": "we go over to the receiver tab here that you'll notice that if I flip switch one see the value we're"}, {"start":

how we can have two switches affect one channel it's basically just four positions here we got"}, {"start": 392.34, "end": 396.34, "text": "two times two so"}, {"start": 396.34, "end": 404.34, "text":

so we're just gonna slide up and why isn't it letting me make that smaller that's fine I guess"}, {"start": 448.26, "end": 455.8, "text": "that's fine all right so save we are armed yeah we should probably unarm hello that was scary I did not"}, {"start": 455.8, "end": 462.28000000000003, "text": "expect that all right so here we are unarmed and no beeper so how do we add the beeper"},

let's go ahead and set up the um modes or the uh"}, {"start": 497.58000000000004, "end": 505.12, "text": "angle mode at least so we're going to put this on ox two and that's going to be right there at the"}, {"start": 505.12, "end": 520.38, "text": "beginning and then horizon ox two in the middle there and then that will be angle mode so that's how"}, {"start": 520.38, "end": 529.9, "text": "easy that is anyways thanks for watching and I hope this uh taught you something that you didn't already"}, {"start": 529.9, "end": 530.2, "text": "know"}]}
