The creator goes on to tell you what you will need for this, an: ESC and battery to power the receiver and a bind key that activates the binding state of the receiver. Because of this, you will have to plug the bind key into the last port of the receiver that is used for input power. Then you must take the BEC wire of the ESC, which is the input power to the receiver, and plug it into any port on the receiver. The creator warns to make sure the signal (white) wire is facing upwards towards you. Lastly, he states to then plug the battery into the ESC and then the light in the receiver will begin to blink to represent it is in bind mode. He states that before turning the transmitter on to put all the switches up and the throttle down, press the bind key, and turn on the transmitter to show binding.
