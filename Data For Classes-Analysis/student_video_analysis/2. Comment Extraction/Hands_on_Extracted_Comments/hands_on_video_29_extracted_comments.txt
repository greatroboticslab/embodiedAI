You are an excellent teacher. By the way, there is an extension for Arduino on Visual Studio Code Editor.

What might be wrong if it’s not acknowledging my OUTPUTs and they’re not changing color

I find your video very useful. Help me a lot to follow. I'm  a newbie here and have troble catching up with other videos. I have to pause to find another resource to explain in details and come back to continue. But your video is totally different. Well explained in the video itself. This is amazing! Great stuff. Thank you so much and subscribed!

Shes hot

Excellent true explanation of the workings between the motor to arduino. Spot on!

Congratulations, very informative video. Τhe presentation is understandable. The way that you teach is just universally enjoyable and very well structured. CNGRATULATIONS!!!

I see some kind of physiological illness in her. Technical subjects and engineering do not have to deal with such a stupid behavior about spiders.

Muchas gracias amiga mia,estoy solomente aprediendo como usar electronic, ya no tengo uno arduino .gracias para su demontracion de sus projectos. Estoy arpreniendo espanol. Saludos. Sam.

Is there a way to upload the code on a USB and leave it plugged into the Arduino? So I do not have a laptop sitting next to it the entire time. Thank you!

Very enjoyable and informative teaching, Thanks!

I've been learning C script for making video games inside of vrchat and I recently decided to start learning about programming Arduino boards I can't believe it's all the same kind of code! Thank you for this!

Come herr to learn more about motor controlling. But I also learned new stuff of the arduino I didn't knew before. Thank you very much 😊

3:33 I can recommed creating a pcb and ordering your custom pcb at a company who print them. Then you have noch this cable mess

excellent stuff

I am making a project in which my 12v dc motor has to be rotated in both clockwise and counterclockwise direction for different time intervals. Can I get in touch with you regarding some confusions ?

Great job. Thank you so much.

جميل الترجمة العربية 🇸🇦

I connected all of the wires together correctly and I wrote the code the same as in the video, but my motor for some reason won't move at all even though the code says that it has uploaded. Does anyone know what might be the issue? I made sure already that I have the wires connected to the correct side that matches up with the dock that my motor is connected to.

I like the way you explained it. I learned and at the same time I had a lot of fun. Your are the best.

Great Video!

im pretty sure you upload it to your arduino and its stored there. you dont have to have anything plugged in

What motor driver are you using? Not all of them have a GND pin to form a common ground. Sometimes you have to jam in an extra ground into into the screw terminal to send to the Arduino. The XY-160D has a specific GND pin for this but not all motor drivers do.

Thank you! 😃

Glad you enjoyed it 😄

Reach out to us if you would be interested in sampling some of our industrial-focused Arduino products.  We think they would make great content for your channel.  Anyways, keep the videos coming.

My mind is completely blown at how easy you make this look! Thank you for your videos.

im loving this channel

Thank you very mutch I finally hope to be able to understand a circuit more complicated than a light bulb switch. Now I just have to hope that my old brain can retain the information.

A great video. INSTA - SUB.

I just say that you are one bad ass. I’ve just started getting into Arduino/raspberry pie world and was scratching my head on what kind of starter kit to get thinking about what I would like to do and landed here. Is there a kit you would recommend for someone who has not purchased any supplies whatsoever? I want to control a motor that will simply function as a deadbolt, in addition to using a magnetic lock.

Great video on controlling motors! Super helpful for a quick start, especially if you have not used Arduino or motors before.

I have never paid more attention and wanted to learn while also losing myself in the gaze of someone so beautiful... I do not appreciate how these tables have been turned on me!!! 😂

it is remarkable how similar Rachel's on-screen personality and "look"is like that of Angela Petrelli in her guitar lessons. Both high-energy girls well-versed in their craft, both very attractive, both no-nonsense! Are they the same person? You decide. I like them both, and their videos too

Which is the adaptor you are using

Using "int" (-32,768 to 32,767) for pin declarations is an overkill, the "byte" (0-255) is more than enough 😎

12:17 I love free stuff.  :)

Jesus H , do you wanna get married? lmao

Wow, been trying to learn Arduino for many years by reading books and watching tutorials. She does such a fantastic job of using analogies and simple terms while starting from the simple and gradually move to the more complex. I finally get the big picture after just watching this ONE video! What a fantastic teacher….thanks for the video!

Hi, Since years I wanted to start with arduino to drive a small wood prototype and your video is so clear and well explained and your positivity makes the video very enjoyable thank you very much !!

Thank you youtub and thank you queen of tech heroes

Tits😊

Can this persons voice be anymore annoying.

You would have fun in my Lab and metal fab shop if you can think it you can make it with what I have in both..

Thank you for providing such a great video, you were a pleasure to watch and so very good at teaching!

Awesome video, Im a sophomore Mechanical Engineering student and this video really saved my project.

Hope it helps for your next motorized project!

Damn, I'd live out the rest of my life with her, for sure....

what a great video. You are a really good teacher!

Excellent knowladge

Goodnight. I have a question for you: why didn't you use the new Arduino IDE for your codes? I would be immensely grateful if you could answer that. Grateful. (translated)

A small tip for those of you who hasn't programmed all that much. 1: Use variables instead of numbers if the library accepts this. Instead of writing 125 at the speed control, and you have 10 motors, if you use variables than you need to change ONE or two or three things instead of ten.  2: write constant before int "pin name" = 5; This tells the compiler (human to computer language black magic thingy) that don't touch this number! This will be 5 forever and ever.  Another function that I would've implemented within the code is a acceleration and retardation  of the motor from stationary, we talk about 5-15ms maybe just to lower the starting current of the system. This function can be called from any time within the program. Especially if the prop are heavy and the control arm are in a bad place or angle, because those motors will rip either the prop to pieces or burn the H-bridge if it stalls for some reason. 5-10A are running currents not stall current.  3: Use the map function in Ardu it can make the speed control more hooman readable,  this function calculates two values into two other. Like this. value_to_spider_speed = map(speedpin, 70, 255', 0, 100); or if the number would be the other way -> 0,100, 70, 255 just test. this will make the your code easier to maintain too, for example if you want 50% speed then you just type in 50 instead of starting to calculate what 50% speed is between 70-255 bla bla.  And about the spider, I presume that this parking puls could be used to count the number of rotations done, instead of relaying on time and as a safety feature (think WDT) if the Ardu doesn't get any pulses... either the motor is stalled or a fuse has released its smoke or worse, the cat is stuck in the prop. It will be crude but for whatever its worth.  And last: make sure that the motor control has protection against back-emf or those motors, solenoids and relay and other inductive loads can and will kill your controller and or Arduino. Most of these has diodes or capacitors for this purpose and the interface against the Ardu is probably equipped with opto-couplers. The thing is that a relay or a motor that switches or stops abruptly can generate voltages well above 5, 12 or even 48Vdc, we're talking about hundred of volts under right circumstances. I'm not trying to scare anyone but have this in mind.

I LOVE HER  GOOD JOB

Thank you super video. Have an arduino for nearly 10 years with post purchase blues. So didn’t get much done with it. Thank you you have energised my imagination hopefully I get a project done now

Hi again. Loved the video. It kills me how more knowledgeable entities will come on a learning video, like yours, flex their brain muscle and start to talk and show you how they may know more than you... On a learning video!!!...   "They" should reserve their comments, though they may be good info with good intentions, for more advanced learning videos on the same subject matter. Pffft!

Hi-eee.  Newbie to Arduino (obviously why I'm here) your channel. Was watching on my own, then my 8-year-old came to see why I was chuckling.  She sat on the floor and I wanted to if she grasped any of this or was even interested.  So she watched you because I was laughing at how you make some expressions to get the point across.  A child being a child, she watched for the 1st.15 min, 12 minutes longer than I expected. So I think I'll show her more of your video in small doses. You know Baby steps. It's how we learn.

Like your. passion and simplicity explanation, with visualization of real working materials ,that represented, very good!!!

Love the way you describe it in my language not all scientifical. And your HOTT!

Love it! Subbed here.

70 or 80 years ago, I used to control d.c. motors with a switch and potentiometer (vary the current in the field coil).

I love you miss thanks.

BTS7690B can be used instead of XY-160d ???

Great video with superb step by step explanation. I am new to coding with arduino and have a complicted machine to program. This has help no end to help understand the environment , instruction set and the logic too. Huge thanks for doing these vidoes.

You are really good at explaining . Imma give this project a go. Just need a motor controller :)

If everyone had this attitude we would have warp drive by now...your awesome thank you for all your effort.

FFS, I can't listen this over excited idiot. 27s is enough.

excellent video

Brilliant !

I don't use my live streaming computer for day-to-day coding (just presentation) so the Arduino IDE gets outdated. I always make a mental note to update when I see it while streaming but then forget once the live workshop is done 🤣  You'll see it updated in future videos!

Absolutely, that's another great motor driver module for high current DC motors. It can handle even more Amps than the XY-160D that I used. 👍

These videos are just brilliant... Understanding electronics is one level but comprehending it like your videos is another!!!

Rachel I came across your videos because I wantes to make a shooting game using a windshield wiper motor. This is great, what i need some help with is using a piezoelectric shock sensor to turn the motor clockwise?

I have been a professional software engineer for 30+ years and I have done lots of Arduino programming as well. I watched your video because I am very interested in motor control. The way that you teach is just universally enjoyable and very well structured. Thanks Rachel!

This video managed to turn the light of understanding in my head to ( HIGH); thanks !

The only “fast” involved in my projects how fast the one project turns into 3, 4, 5 other projects.

Would a PWM of 25% not be 63 instead of 64?

It's hard but I enjoyed watching. 😅

Great lèsson for beginner❤

OHMYGAAAAAWWWWWD!!!! SHE'S ON SPEEEEEEEEED!!!

Amazing all around.

Brilliant. No reason you came to my feed that I know of. But so good that I have this for reference now. Really enjoyed your voluptuous style and clarity as bright as your eyes. If that made sense to anyone you have a better grasp of english than I do of Arduino! After Rachel De barros explained and demonstrated how to make it function for "You"!

Hi Rachel and thanks for a great video 🫡 I really like how your explained all the functions of the arduino so now i feel like starting to use mine that's been in my drawer for 5years 😂 Keep up the good work and you've got yourself a new subscriber from Sweden 👍😁

Some things just don't work. Women coding is one of them.

You probably know why now but the motor ran backwards because IN1 didn’t go to 8, it went to 7.

Thank you so much Rachel for your recent reply but I am still not clear. Assume I have already uploaded the code to the UNO and disconnected my Laptop USB cable from the UNO (UNO now has no power).   I now connect the 12-volt power supply to the Motor Shield and the wire connections to both boards are as you show in your video.  Is the UNO somehow getting 5 volts from the Motor Shield?  I really don’t want to have two power sources, one 5-volts to the UNO (USB) and one to the Motor Shield (12-volt).  My plan is to place the UNO WFI board/Motor Shield/12-volt connection in another room and send on-off, speed, direction etc. from my Cell Phone to the UNO by Wi-Fi. Thank you.

ok i have a control board that the blowers power output control is dead so i need to make a system that can handle this. it has 2 blowers that the output seemed to range from 8v-14v on one(exhaust blower seemed to have 3 or 4 speeds i'd do 4) and 6v-14v heat exchanger interior fan. in the end i would like a way to increase it on the fly but also want it to always at least do low but adjustability via knob is a future issue. on the original board it can output the voltage still but no amps at all except enough to see it's voltage. Is there a way to use this value to set the blower value via the original controller and if so how would i do this? original controller has the pellet auger which has 5 settings and these correspond as a example(2secound on 15 seconds off for level 1, 2 seconds on every 10 seconds, and so on.)  and 3 safety systems(flame sense 110f normal open till 110f, overheat 220 normal closed manual reset switch, vacuum switch to detect exhaust fan is working normally open unless fan on than closed) all 3 safety systems switches are simple bi-metallic(heat sensors) or membrane(vacuum) connectors.   Also yes I would buy a new part for it if it was available but it was discontinued in 2001 and there is none available anywhere as it is purely a dc system(they only make AC systems now) that has a converter to bring in 12v-14v(need to verify this yet) via the wall 120v.(baby magnum countryside bd-dc pellet stove) this is ran from a 105AH 12v deep cell agm battery that is charged via 600w of solar power on a mppt. without solar the system can run for 4-6 days at just a direct connection to battery.  So what Adriano and sub board would you recommend? obviously i'd like the fans to me married but run at different speeds as the air exchanger can run way lower than the exhaust blower. my ideal is 5 levels so that is can marry the current 5 levels that it currently have.   I need help please as i am just entering the adriano world

Great video+explanation+presentation! Thank you for sharing well done mate - NEW SUB 🙏🏻

You're as intelligent as you are beautiful. Of the other videos I have watched to learn how to program an Arduino, yours is the only one that makes sense to me. Have you done "milli" to play a sound with an animation? I would like to see if it is possible to read a mp3 or wav file from an SD card while the animation is taking place. Ever do anything like that?

Hi, new here to electronics. I have a project that requires a 12v led strip and a motor. Can I hook them both up to the smaller power conversion board thingy?

Beautiful! Finally explaining it all! Thank you!

That's a fun idea! I should be getting in some piezo sensors in soon so you'll see some videos on those soon!

Glad you enjoyed it! Let me know if there's any other topics you'd like me to cover.

I'm so glad! 🤩

Possible Mecanum Wheel control will be covered? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecanum_wheel

Thank you so much, very interesting. and well explained.

Тетка, с твоими выпученными глазами не правильно лечили всякие ЛГБТ специалисты видимо...

Great pedagogy Rachel! Thank you! You earn a new sub!

Best arduino Video i have ever seen. I myself attached Joystick to  uno R3 , L298n, two yellow motors. Next will be wlan, maybe esp32. Started 3 weeks ago. Thank you so much.

O no sur suh a nice vidéo.clear explanation  l wish youtube was this ❤

Very good! this should help a ton of people learning this

Great video, every detail well explained.

Marry me @RachelDeBarrosLive

I am a retired Industrial Engineer. I have programmed PLC Controls for decades. I have good learning/Comprehension skills. I've been trying to learn C++ basics and concepts and keep running into "how to" videos from people who have no ability to Teach. Rachel is the first of MANY to break things down and cover EVERYTHING. You write on the screen and explain what "it does" and "why we do this" .......with others, I keep finding myself going out on the Web to find definitions and explanations for terminology and concepts they ignore....so frustrating. Thank you  Rachel.

such  a nice video, clear explanation, I wish youtube was just this

this is best explanation I have ever seen, Literally !

Hello,can you design a driver for stepper motor that it have 10 wires, please

Можно подробную схему???

Brilliant!!!

RISKING BEING CALLED SEXIST  I AM PLEASE TO NOTE THE INCREASE OF WOMEN IN NON-TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT IN THE WEST.  LIVING IN THE FAR EAST, I AM USED TO IT. WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU ASK A STREET CLEANER OR OTHER SANITARY WORKER FOR A DATE?

My projects are never going as fast or as slow as I would like 🤣😂🤣😂

Hi Rachael, I like the way you explain... It would be really good if the code has comment. Comments help alot in coding. Please see bellow as an example.

// Motor control pins const int ENA = 9; // Enable pin for motor A const int IN1 = 8; // Input pin 1 for motor A const int IN2 = 7; // Input pin 2 for motor A  void setup() {   // Initialize motor control pins   pinMode(ENA, OUTPUT);   pinMode(IN1, OUTPUT);   pinMode(IN2, OUTPUT); }  void loop() {   // Set motor speed (0-255)   int speed = 150; // Adjust speed as needed      // Set motor direction   digitalWrite(IN1, HIGH);   digitalWrite(IN2, LOW);      // Set motor speed   analogWrite(ENA, speed); }

I'm  taking up Arduino programming because of you. You simplify the jargon.

She really makes it fun to learn and putting everything together practically 👏and explaining step by step.

This is perfect! I plan on using one of these motors for my gate openers and this is the last part I need to install it.

Very good to see that being a lady you beat the Arduino in a very easy way.

Wow, I had a really tough time making it through that heavy southern draw of that accent. 😝

I have been wanting to add  Arduino to my props for a couple of years but have been too scared to start, until now. Thanks!

What's your longest delayed prop development? I built a Thermal Detonator (ala Return of The Jedi) many years back out of 'homebrew' electronics and cobbled together mechanisms (It worked fine, but was a mess of wires and JB Weld inside), and thought I could revisit it more aesthetically now that I use Arduino and purpose built sound modules. Well, that 'revisit' has been in pieces at the back of my bench now for 3 years +, what with designing and printing internal cages to hold the Pro Mini and JQ6500, and the speaker, buck converter, USB charger for the 3.7 LiPo and the LiPo itself, while still leaving room for the microswitches. I will finish it one day, promise!

Are we just gonna ignore the fact that this creator is hinting at making a robot army of zombies and spiders?  Jk 😄, this is such a great video, especially for a beginner like me I’ve seen a lot of beginner videos, where they show you a few things, and then go off into advanced projects and start using terms that only they know, and I’ve never heard of (I’m looking at you, ‘Mr. should’ve added a function’)

I definitely see you with your own show on DIY, Home improvement, Science show on cable TV!!!!!

You had me laughing so many times, and your very helpful too, thanks for breaking it down so I understood, I likey and subscribey too! LoL

Come on!!!! "Rachel" !!!! Is this for real ??? "Rachel" ??? Where is your boy friend assisting you ?

Barros liké portugueses or Spanish?

I randomly came across this video by following the "YouTube rabbit hole." I have absolutely zero experience with the Arduino- I've never even seen one in person. I only know of their existence because some people make projects with them in amateur radio (my main hobby). Plus, I'm in my early 50s, so I don't soak up information as well as younger people. However, there wasn't a single thing you presented in this video that I didn't fully understand. Your teaching style is outstanding and you made all the gears click in my brain- and some of those gears are pretty rusty! That's a subscribe for me!

Is my first time I see your channel. Excellent explanation . Wonderful class, thank you:hand-pink-waving:

You look interesting like my sister who is a retired scientist.

Basically this would be a good video if you show how to control the wiper motor at delay various speeds between low and high and then you have the shut-off circuits that make sure the wiper blades shut off and the blades are in the right position. This should be super great video with just with simple things like this, especially the time delay on an older wiper motor.

You teach very well and your personality makes the videos very easy and fun to watch.

Very cool thanks for sharing your knowledge! Can you share the software you use to record your videos and split screen?

i sat and watched your video last night in bed and though this video is gunna be a right bag of u know what, but bugger me turned out really good i actually learned summet that is going 2 be bloody usefull to me so big thumbs up and iv subscribed

I feel like Neo in The Matrix when he gets plugged in and learns jujitsu. Thank you so much for this. I have been wanting to add motion to my metal sculptures for years. ❤️

Is there any way I can talk you into doing an addition to this video with radio control?

I love you so much for this wish i would have found you sooner such a Big help you are down to earth and keep it simple Thank you so much

A robot army of zombies and spiders? My secret is out! 🤣

I use OBS Studio. It's FREE 🥳

I was a controls engineer for 45+ years and also taught industrial controls and PLC's at the local community college. You have a very nice teaching style, good job. I just found your channel so what I'm about to say you might have already addressed in another video, but when using Arduino, I tell people to never use the delay() function because the delay() function literally stops the program from executing code. So...if you set a delay(3000) 3-seconds and there is code below the delay(3000)  that needs to be serviced during that 3-sec. delay, it will not get serviced. I recommend using the millis() or micros() function and setting a duty cycle with a bit of math for current time and previous time. That way the program keeps "scanning' the loop() function even during the delay.

Something like 400 and 800 Hz echo in your mic and/or room. Trying to EQ it out but still sounds so bad :( my poor ears. Wish I could send you a $60 mic or better.

I'm in love, Glad I found this channel..

Great video!

If you also connect AS5600 contactless angle sensor check

this stuff is my hobby

Bones coffee is the best!

Hello how could I run a 8 channel relay board from 12v dc also using a fuse flock and a 9v regulator as well as a HC-05 wifi control board please  Thank you for your time  Kind regards Nick from New Zealand

Its fun listening to you and you're telling it as a story, and my brain thinks "oh, now its actually easy to understand". Thanks for this!

Thank You so much Ms. Rachel!! It was worth spending 45min here.

Project Stalling is par for the course.     I have 3 helmets im working on at the same time and got sidetracked with home projects and work.    You are not alone..

Very nice, thank you. Little confused about power in both boards. If I remove the USB coding cable (assume I am done coding), does the Uno board still have power (5 Volts?)? Is the Uno 5 volts coming from the Motor Shield? In other words, does the Uno still have 5 volts and the Motor Shield 12 volts when USB cable is disconnected? Thank You.

I think the best video I've seen ever on Arduino

This girl is like way to hot to be this nerdy

Merci beaucoup

Woah.. awesomeness!!!! Love it! You have just given me ideas that I want to dive into for halloween!!!! I am playing with the seeed studio esp32c3 - so tiny.. very small.. like tip of finger small. I want to try the arduino mp3 player - get it working.. then use the esp32c3 instead... then i can have halloween sounds play remotely with say motion...

Have been using Arduinos for over a decade now and it's great to see someone who is equally excited about them.

I literally copied and pasted what you wrote. Still can't get the motor to move or get OUTPUT to change color. Does anyone have an idea of what I maybe doing wrong?

When I type pinMode(IN1pin, OUTPUT); output is not recognized. Does anyone know why that is?

Great video! Lots of great imformation for beginners. Thx.

You're absolutely right! 👍 Except for simple programs, I usually stick with millis(). I do have a video dedicated to using millis and another one for using interrupts. But I can't deny that delay is an easy concept for beginners that have little to no coding experience to understand, so that's why you see them in all my beginner videos like this one. I have another millis video coming out using a PIR sensor to orchestrate LEDs, servos, motors and mp3 players in March! Stay tuned!

@RachelDeBarrosLive  Thanks for the reply Rachel. I found your millis() video and your interrupt video. Very well done. I'll be very interested in the mp3 player. I'm doing the research for animating a Moebius 1:6 scale Lost in Space robot and already have sound files so I'll be interested in how [you] do the mp3 player. I'm looking for one that I can chose what sound track I want to play. My plan is to have everything RC controlled. That's all new ground for me, but it's so much fun!!!! I'll be watching. Great job!!! I'm so glad I found your channel. 😀😀

Audio has been a challenge because I'm in an open space (garage) with concrete walls and high ceilings - so a lot of reverb and echo. These same mics sound fantastic in smaller rooms (and are far more expensive than $60). I've put up the same foam padding as they use in recording studios all over the ceiling and walls that aren't seen on camera but I honestly haven't noticed much of a difference. My next idea is to add curtains to try and make the space I'm using smaller.

@RachelDeBarrosLive  Damn! But don't worry...seems most people have crappy hearing anyway.  My ears are too good. I should have found a way to make lots of money off my audio abilities :(

@RachelDeBarrosLive  Move mice closer to your voice and get a floor stand (off your desk)... That will for sure help. (The closer to you, the less the room matters.)

The USB cable that goes from your computer to the Arduino both powers it and allows you to upload code to it. As long as the Arduino is getting power from this cable, it can also power the motor driver module. The 12V power supply only powers the motor and nothing else.  If you disconnect the USB cable from the Arduino then it won't have power and neither will the motor driver module. You can either continue powering your Arduino with the USB cable or use the barrel jack right next to that to plug in a 9V power adapter. You can also power the Arduino with a battery pack.

Thank you so much Rachel but I am still not clear.  Assume I have already uploaded the code to the UNO and disconnected my Laptop USB cable from the UNO (UNO now has no power).   I now connect the 12-volt power supply to the Motor Shield.  Is the UNO somehow getting 5 volts from the Motor Shield?  I really don’t want to have two power sources, one to the UNO (USB) and one to the Motor Shield (12-volt).  My plan is to place the UNO WFI board/Motor Shield/12-volt connection in another room and send signals from my Cell Phone to the UNO by Wi-Fi. I have some really good ideas for more videos you can do. Thank you.   @RachelDeBarrosLive

Glad to hear it! Let me know if there's any other topics you'd like me to cover.

Great idea!! I have a series on using a PIR sensor to activate all kinds of things like LEDs, servos, motors and even an mp3 player coming soon!

🤣 Arduino has allowed me to do so many cool projects!

What motor driver are you using?

I imagine you mean that OUTPUT is not turning into a green color. If that's the case, are you using all caps like OUTPUT instead of output or Output?

Very welcome!

how can i understand Arduino programming and coding?

Outstanding tutorial. Turning that motor on or off with a button or sensor would be a dream come true for me.

You are so smart!.

Hi, this is the first video I watch but I will follow you,  because I can learn way a lot. can you please tell me where you get all your supplies  Thanks in advance and super great video!!!!.

Good job, well done. Explained very well.

Amazing, really good tutorial :)

Great tutorial! Would this still work when I use arduino uno R3 SMD?

Thanks for the demo.  It gave me an idea on how to scare woodpeckers away from drilling holes in the side of our house. A while back amazon was selling the large spiders that would reel down on a wire quickly when it detected a noise. After a period of time it would reel back up. It turned out these spiders were a great deterrent for woodpeckers. Only problem is they are not available anymore due to defective operation.  I was wondering if you could hook a microphone to the arduino and decode the woodpecker as a 101010... and drop the spider, shake it around and make some hissing noise. Could you outline this code on how to get started? This would be a fun project.  Can the arduino go to sleep and listen for the thump of the woodpecker.  Also it might make a fun Halloween project.

"you can't un-see this", i love it...

a relay would have been good . Relays can also handle 120V ac These relays have an input switching Via Arduino

For that last example if you want to avoid the case of double zeros or double ones stopping the motor, change the first 3 lines of your loop:  void loop() {   int spinDir = random(0,2);   digitalWrite(IN1pin, spinDir);   digitalWrite(IN2pin, 1-spinDir);   …  Now whatever spinDir is set to (0 or 1), the second pin will be set to 1 minus that value:  so if it picks 0, the second pin will be 1 - 0 = 1. If it picks 1, second pin will be 1 - 1 = 0.   Any time you need to flip between 2 numbers but don’t want to waste time checking the current value, perhaps in an interrupt routine, just add the 2 numbers together and set the value to that sum minus the current variable. This will always work as long as you initialize the variable to one of the two values.  So if you need a variable K to flip between 13 or 77, just do: …   int K = 13;  // initialize variable …   K = 90 - K; // flip to other value …  So the first time it flips:   90 - 13 = 77 Second flip:   90 - 77 = 13 Etc…

You have a great way of putting the information over I'm new to coding.

Show us your booleans lol

I won an Edison (with Arduino breakout board) from Intel and the only thing I could think to do with it was to drive the dual electric fans in my project car by PWM based on temp input. I knew it couldn't handle the voltage/amps, and that (mechanical) relays wouldn't like PWM input. Solid-state relays are stupid expensive, so I gave up on the idea. I didn't think about a motor driver board tho. Wonder if I could source one beefy enuf? 🤔

I just stumbled upon your channel and even though I don’t know if I’ll ever need this information I liked and subscribed. You’re simply a great teacher and I need those in my life!

How do I control the motor if I want to treat it as a step motor and tell it how many turns or fractions of a turn to spin?

My first prosthetic has taken a LOT longer than I had hoped. Started with the 3D printer, that lead into code, and that lead into the Arduino... and so on and so on...

Why does it feel like anytime women try to teach tech, i cant make it past intro before leaving?

will it work on a golfcarts I would like to build one for a 36v system

Amazing Instruction. Thank You so Much. I have waited so long to talk my language. Where do you find the language of Arduino?

Great idea for a future workshop! In the meantime, I have an upcoming one about how to control a motor with a motion sensor later this month.

So much fun, I'm a coder and to listen how you explain complex stuff like variable types, program and pulse width modulation that clearly and quickly explains it is refreshing! Keep up the good work!

Finally, Someone who talks 'How to do'  rather than 'Just a do this'    You have opened a few doors previously locked to me.

I’m so happy I found you.  I’m just starting to watch your videos, but just in one video I learned a lot.   My brain almost exploded just like my motor controllers have 😂

no clue what the video was. them glasses did me in. oooooooo yeahhhhhhhhh

Nice job, you explain everything. Thank you! I have a question for you that drives me crazy. Motor controllers (PWM) can linear speed control but can they nonlinear speed control?

Way ta go, you explained that awesomely, I'm ok with electronics and mechanics but have never attempted coding as it scares me sh@+less but you've made me feel like i might actually be able to achieve something .........so thankyou for that

What type of engineering would this be considered?

Rachel, you are a gem. Explanation is simple.

I've been thinking about one of my solo project that I believe you can help me .... you know that car door electric mirrors -- with it's controls of left-right-up-down .. I want to apply this to an out door surveillance camera that presently is a dummy case but I plan to install raspberry pi in it -- and some movement would do the trick ... what do you think ? .... great video BTW ....

What should be a 15 minute video took 56 minutes

You are overwhelmingly intense. Consider turning it down a notch.

I liked your tutorial I have wanted to,learn Arduino. I wish I knew you more on a personal level

❤bril

First, great video and explanation! Let me give a few remarks on coding: 1. as another commentator already stated, using #define constants instead of variables for "never changing" or "magic number" values, like pin associations, or the motor's low speed (magic number 70), is better. 2. inherited from C++ (Arduino language is basically a superset of C++), you can use the shortcut var += increment instead of var = var + increment. Works with all arithmetic operators (-=, *=, /=,...). 3. try to avoid delay(). The processor is literally delaying then, means it does nothing else. You'll get in trouble if you want to do something concurrently then.  4. I'd have the movement of the motor put into a function, like void turn( int direction, int speed ), so you reduce three lines of code into one. Same with stop().  Re my point 3: I've almost nobody seen to address this, albeit this is basic microprocessor programming knowledge I learned almost 40 years ago 😊(Yes I'm an Old White Man, and credits to Professor Reichert of Engineering school Aalen who was a great teacher). I wrote a tiny class that works as a timer and executes code after a specified delay or in specified intervals, or tells you if a delay is over instead of halting the program. Also you can break the granularity down from milliseconds to microseconds, because you can use the micros() function instead of the millis(). The caveat is that this method adds some imponderability to the programs, so you can't predict when exactly which function is executed, because that depends on if some function is busy longer than the time checking interval is.  But great explanation of the Arduino's power capabilities! Overloading ports is one reason why newbies fry their Arduinos and then end up frustrated.

Just letting you know that all my projects lost take Forrrrrrrrrever, I thinks it’s a learning curve combined with life , also projects make mess , so managing mess is not my specialty, my whole house is a workshop. 😝

I love your instruction style already - I'm yours. I have most of the arduino cards but I see the motor controller you are using is not avail (Amazon) Is there an upgraded substitute? Thanks for the knowledge. Oh and do they make a motor controller that is an attachable shield? //ji

I know all too well about projects taking longer. I started my 6x6 RV in Jan ‘19 and I’m still working on it. I thought I’d have it finished in a year, but oh no! It gets work when I’m not working on everything in life, like moving and buying property and everything else.

Thank you for a clear explanation of pwm motor control.

GOD BLESS you for your posting and ALL GOOD THINGS COME WITH TIME & LEARNING!

RACHEL !!!  I am so glad I stumbled across your channel.  Weird timing:  I am teaching myself Arduino programming to control servo motors for some machining projects I'm trying out.  Awesome job explaining what you're doing, and how the Arduino works! That helps me learn as a newbie at this stuff.   I so miss seeing you on All Girls Garage!  Subscribed now, so I can start getting my "Rachel" fix again !

I like your idea,  some these people, Why would anybody post here, VIDEO means showing stuff with sound ? Or am I think about this in the wrong way. WAKE-UP-PEOPLE

No doors were opened and youre annoying.

I know you can do it! You'll have your motor working just the way you want.

You are a great teacher.

👍👍👍👍👍❤❤❤❤

Hi Rachel thank you for this video, please how can this work with 230v and what kind of Arduino and speed control can I use

motorSpeed+=10     🙂

Hi, if I want to control the motor with a 5V thumb roller with 2.5V at rest and decrease in one direction to 0.5V and increase to 4.5 volts in the other direction

...I'm a simple guy... I see boobs, I press "like"....

I love your accent. I need to get back to my arduino and raspberry pie projects. Thanks for the motivation.

to prevent the stopping with both IN1pin and IN2pin having the same number ... assign the random(0,2) to a variable and use opposite notation for the second pin IE: direction = random(0,2); digitalWrite(In1pin, direction); digitalWrite(IN2pin, !direction);  if that works, then you could eliminate the stop if you wanted

All I can say is that I wish I had you teaching my first collage course Very interesting and easy to follow. Many or the tutorials on YouTube leave so much out of the expiation You are teaching properly.

Rach, you have a lot of knowledge, you explain ok, but you have little wisdom.  you should create arduino projects that are close to reality. like... controlling an array of 1-3 water valves in oder to water huge gardens. or start a a fan one a temperature sensor reaches this . or start a motor when a temperature sensor reaches this.  i mean... people live real lives. the age of angry birds and fancy dancy do it for fun is gone. we matured.  i want to use an arduino to automatically start a gas stove and PID control the flame intensity by controlling a valve. i dotn want the milk to boil, i want it to stay at 90 Celsius.  do it. i mean... cpiders..crawlers..all is bla bla. wake upt, do real life arduino projects. buy real valves, connect them , and do it. you cant operate in the imaginary world just switching on and off. no

Just finished watching. great stuff. I know a a lot of people who are going to be your fans. thanks

Hey! Just discovered your  video and am falling in love with you already. You're such a great teacher. Wish I could say the same for my teacher. He sucks!!!! You're sooooooo clear and precise. Guess I'll be coming back for more.

Just found you, and you make it look easy, you are a good teacher, I been hearing this Arduino but kinda intimated, but seeing your video, I feel I can do a simple Arduino project, thanks a lot.😊

Good work and looking lovely girl 🌹

Got no project

Are you hooked into the 12v while usb powering arduino? Was wondering if thats safe, amazing video, best i found yet on using these type of motor controllers. Thank you!!!

My projects take forever cause there always in refinment or upgrade mode

Ok,  So you can build a thingamagig.    But the real test is, can you cook a man a good meal.

Really like how you're explaining things. I just subscribed

The squiddlies lines mean appropriate.  She needs a 3d pen to make a web.

Sorry I mean 230v electric motor

30 v would make it faster 😊

Can you do this with a 24 volt DC motor. ?

Incy Wincy is going to need longer to get back to the ceiling if you're winding it in slower. Since you've set the PWM @ 2/3rds the value, running the motor for half as long again would be a fair starting point.

Question, what if you are using 2 motors and want one motor to run for say 20 seconds and stop, then the other motor to run for 5 seconds then stop, then repeat, all in the same direction?? Thank you I find your videos Awesome, especially for complete idiots like me😊  Keep up the Great videos

Great tutorial, thanks for making this look simple

Entering these lines would ensure that the motor always moves one direction or the other. No conflicts if (IN1pin == 1) {   IN2pin = 0 } else if (IN1pin == 0) {   IN2pin = 1

wow... loud and animated. Sorry was a little too much for my brain. I am not trying to be mean, It's my own issue. I will sub and like anyway.

Any way to add in safety,  like high resistance to trigger the motor to stop.  Incase something or someone gets tangled in the animation you are working on? Like  sliding doors on a minivan.

You made your movies for kids, but the once that respond very positively to them are we, grown ups and old people. That's very interesting, Anyway, keep doing what you're doing. F.e. your millis clip is unbeatable. What do you think about a comparison between frequency and pwm. there are motors with an inbuild pwm converter that can take a pwm signal with any frequency from 300 hz to some khz. And than a question comes to my mind, why is the frequency of an arduino pwm signal 490 or 980 Hz? And last but not least, I realized, even small children are already doing a cost benefit calculation, where the cost is the making of the part, and the benefit is the fun it generates when they use it to blow up the neighbors mailbox with it. So to get  access to kids means to provide them with benefit. I

Everybody else on here has already stated it so i wont, oh hell yes i will, absolutely brilliant video/tutorial, the best i have ever seen on coding, thank you

I like the way you speak in a language most of us can understand. Too many people use the very technical language just assuming we all speak electronics and computer code. Nice job.

This is the hottest nerd in all of human existence

I have always been drawn way more to hardware then programming, but this integrates both. The industrial machines i worked on do this on a larger scale, so this is the path to greater machinery starting here.

She lost me when she said code.... I program microprocessors.... i write programs for them... when I code I'm in a hospital somewhere... needing a doctor....

Got to hand it to you.. perfectly explained.

You explain everything in such a fantastic way. I have been struggling so much with coding because everyone only talks about doing it but you explain it with examples while doing it. Thank you!!!

congratulations from Brazil...+2 subsc.  obs.: random enable is not safe to Mosfet or power supply. "short circuit"   Can change random both together (0,1 1,0) or (1,0 0,1) with some delay .

❤

absolute amazing video!

I'm new to your channel, and I'm enjoying it. Question. I want to control a wiper motor or a linear actuator based on windspeed through an Arduino.  Help, please and thanks. (I have found some great videos measuring wind speed with an Arduino and, of course, videos such as yours with Arduino controlling a motor) I just need to combine the two.  Thanks in advance

Ok  hi  Rachal i am so glad i fond your channel i have watch you present program on programming a  Arduino . & coding . now let me tell you abbot my self I'm 71 years  old , & Dyslexic. So leaning to coding  for me is a bit of a challenge.  Now my projects will be tow off  One the converting of my  old lathe  to run on an electric lead screw.    & tow is a app for spelling that will add a pitcher .  to  match the spelling when there is  more  than one way to spell the word lick   Night- or - Knight   so the grammar is Wight r   a person  grat  or like the one in the fire places  & or an individual.  so learning to code is imperative & i have never done  coding.  . then there the bracket & things that Mack the langwidge work ? so lets get started tell me the best way to start.

❤❤❤ love it

I hope your of Brazilian heritage as anyone who reads your name will automatically start replying in Portuguese, AND assuming you are LOL

Its  a nice tutorial.Thank a lot.

Thanks, I can apply these ideas to controlling my 12v slotcar track!

that was the best explanation of code on the arduino ive seen.

Love your style of teaching, well done.❤

Awesome glasses! Smokin Hot!

nice work love your style

thank you! Subbed

Just sub's I have been interested in this for a long time just never found anything that at least explains it and was very helpful, you instructions made this really doable for the newbie. Great video

A perfect video, especially for someone not too fond of reading the documentation, who wants to break from merely adjusting someone else`s code. Thanks, definitely subscribed!

You are a fatastic teacher so lively. Love your project.❤ Many thanks😊

2:57 - you're definitely not the only one!  (I'm embarrassed to even say how long ago some of my not-yet-completed, but-still-being-worked-on projects got their first starts...... 😲)  Nice tutorial!

marry me

you had me at 12 volts

hi...excellent video....now i know who to call when there is a lot of repetitive production work.... like heavy lifting...or navigation stuff...have fun out there...

Arduino Great for making the type of toys that satisfy your curiosity and pleasure. 😉

Great video and presentation! I would like to control a small AC fan motor. Are  controllers avilable? Im new to this product.

Can you control a 120 VAC the same way but with a different module?

You would be right! 🇧🇷 Recebo mensagens em Português o tempo todo!

Are you Brazilian? I just started on micro machining and came up to your videos by searching on how to control steeper motors. I still don’t understand all the details on the controllers but your videos help a lot. Sure I’m using NEMA 23 (or 17?) motors with a controller that needs Mach3 software but pretty sure it’s an interface to Arduino. I was even wondering how to find out if it really is but no knowledge enough yet.   Reading your bio I see you’ve been in many projects and even TV!!! Amazing accomplishments!!  Well, thank you for replying!!!

5 volt relay can be used to control motor right ??

I presume if you want to not have the motor stop in the random phase you could leave your in1 the same but for in2 put something like "if in1 =1 then 0, if in1 =0 then 1" ?

The Y in “Ye” is pronounced “th” Yanks in advance.

hmmm ..wonder what application this could be used with

thanks for nice video so nice

Man she’s so loud and obnoxious. Why can’t she talk like a normal person?

So cute

Another Bones Coffee fan in the microcontroller scene?  Nifty.  One who clearly and enthusiastically communicates how to do it?  Dope.

Can it be possible following with Stepper motor https://youtu.be/K7FQSS_iAw0?si=arbj93d4FtY-aq5e

i love your work thank you...for representing ladies in my subscription list

You're Boxxy...

Little correction: 50% duty cycle equals half the power, not half the voltage. Voltage equals the square root of the duty cycle.

You explain it simple. Make it easy to understand.

Thanks for sharing ❤

Very nice video. I need to learn all this.. BTW. Smart (Smarter than me), and pretty... Wow

Gostei da maneira de explicar a programação. Parabéns! Estou estudando programação como hobby.👍👍

how about a sybian like thing for your self . it can have some really cool movements .you can demo it on your channel.

your very good at what you do 🙂

Thank you for the tutorial.  Subscribed and ready for more.

A module to control motors requires a heatsink applied with high quality thermal paste and a fan constantly blowing. Each MOSFET requires a thermal contact with the heatsink. When you do that, it will work very good. Otherwise, the MOSFETs will overheat rapidly and burn up.

Wow that was fantastic👏

Great tutorial - thank you for this!

Excellent explanation for dummies. You explain like a teacher, very understandable, good job.  I am an electronics engineer, I was a teacher a few years before I was retired, I like your style, keep it up.

subsribed

Here I love to watch this tutorial but i want some extraordinary stuff like how to control ceiling AC fan using Arduino and please if you gonna make video on this, please do tag me on that video so that i recognise

Great job very informative for a old man like me, thanks.

I love how arduino has opened up this kind of work to people without formal technical backgrounds.  For a lot of things, if someone can make a spreadsheet, they can use common sense and online examples to do what they need.  I love watching your stuff, since you embody that ethos perfectly.  Keep it up, and good luck to creative people adding tech to their creations!

I love the way you teach as it sinks in,  I would like to have this project but have it reduced in size,  meaning using an ATtiny54 or 85 chip to control the motor and to have only one power source and to turn it on using a push button trigger and upon release it stops,  It would be pefect for me to start  a robot project that is manually controlled. Iwill work out the coding by myselfas cant expect everthing to be done :)

will this work with higher torque requirements ie a dust gate door?

👏👏👍

Interesting & I’m looking forward to learn more

Do you know that you are really cute ?

❤❤❤

Random your direction, by choosing a 0/1, then based on the value, set the direction inputs.

You're a very good teacher .. You should be making lots of money .

Please can I use arduino pro mini for this project....I already have that one

my priject goes very slow. always missing something like servo sqrews or ardino or controller. got 3 rc wood boats, a 1/14 towercrane, 1/14 tower light wagon and some more waiting for stuff or my 2 3d printers:-) i surley need 48 hour per day. happy coninuens of -24

What a great, great, tutorial.... I love It.... Im trying yo make a machine that needs the speed and the force of a car waiper motor, i need that works In just one direction but stops on certain angle with a buton do you can help me on the code? Thanks for sharing

Going through my hesd is a system for a custom kids car.

Another great video.  Suggested future subjects : BLE and Bluetooth 2 separate videos

Great instruction and demonstration skill displayed.

Fantastic explanation on motor controls thank you.

I could just never get it when it came to programing the Arduino, until now. Thanks a lot for the easy and intuitive teaching style you have that really helped me understand what was going on. Most other people just expect that you already know what your doing. I cant wait to get onto some projects now thanks heaps.

I like the Drok motor controller. That's what I use. It uses FET's, and it doesn't have a heatsink, and from what I've experienced, it doesn't hardly get warm, even with heavy use. I think it has opto-isolation, and that's one reason why it has a separate ground. It seems to be a pretty trouble free controller. Also, the wire receptacles are removable. This makes it very easy to wire, if the board is already mounted in something. You can attach the wires to the receptacle, then plug it back in to the board. It also makes it easy to switch channels, if you want to test the other channel.   The power input receptacle is also removable too. If some accident happens to your board, you can easily swap it out, and the project remains wired - aside from the control wires. I like that there are lights for both the control section, and the drive section, so you can tell which sections have power. Also, the positive and negative pins, for the control section are joined, so you can daisy chain & power another board, with the free pins.

Thank you for  sharing you info . What is the number of the wiper motor your using ? I would like to purchase several .looking forward to your spider video .I would like to build one .

Your pin variables should be const byte/uint8_t/unsigned char at the least, but really you should #define them so they don't take up any memory. Also your for loop variable is needlessly global, especially since you reassign it in the next for loop. Again it only needs to be a single unsigned byte. These things really don't have a lot of memory if you want to write anything substantial so it's good practice to keep in mind what kind of variable you need, how big, what scope. Also I don't know it really bugs  me when people use the post increment operator instead of just the increment operator, it needlessly uses a variable and is slower. The post increment/decrement operator is like a special use case, when i really want the value before i increment it, and even that i kind of just avoid because it's a little harder to read. ++motorSpeed and --motorSpeed JUST adds one and subtracts one, respectively.  You're also not getting random values, they'll be exactly the same every time. You need to seed the generator randomSeed(analogRead(A0)); // typically read an unused analog pin  And there's random(unsigned int) which returns 0 - parameter, there's no need to do random(0, n);  #include <Arduino.h> #define IN1 8       // this is a really good idea #define IN2 7      // to do #define ENA 9    // on all projects  void setup() {   randomSeed(analogRead(A0));      // this is important to actually get pseudo random generation   for(byte i  = IN1; i <= ENA; ++i) pinMode(i, OUTPUT); }  void loop() {   digitalWrite(IN1, random(2));   digitalWrite(IN2, random(2));   analogWrite(ENA, random(70, 255);   delay(random(30, 3000); }

Hi, How can we control more than one motor? Thank you

Fabulous video. SO MUCH better than books.  Your production background shows in the presentation.  Much appreciated.  I'm just starting to learn Arduino and how to control the pesky motors.  The video is a great tutorial.   I'll be coming back to this as a refresher.  Subscribed.

learned so much....loooooove your teaching style

ok, i like your for dummies approach, cause im an idiot, and i have built a lot of stuff, but i am going to go through your stuff, glean what i can :)

i need the motor controller but i also need position feedback on the turns in and out for my in flight adjustable propellor on my airplane so i can tie my speeduino ecu to the prop for a constant speed propellor :)

the meaningless pursuit of snow, this is an ad i got 3 minutes in, i am not kidding, the ad is a full movie and it is over 1 hour long, thanks youtube

arduino 5 v 40ma, motor 12 volt 5 amp, you just need to run 60 arduinos in parallel with the same code and clock them all together, right ? :)

via this little knob here, you control the speed of the motor, yeah, thats 101 stuff we learn at puberty :)

I wish i found this video when i started learning arduino, sensors, and controlers. Great work.

If you define your constants as integers, your code will be bigger (integers take bytes) and slower (to load the registers with the integers stored in memory) , better use #define to declare your pin numbers. Also, to avoid loading motorSpeed, applying the operation and storing motorSpeed again, use the += and -= operators (motorSpeed += random(70,256)) to do the operation directly on the memory location. Also, and that may sound the complete opposite of what I just said, you can use a variable for your digital writes to set the direction, just use direction and !direction ("not direction") and use a (simple) function to start the motor in either direction: it's a net gain of size as soon as you call your function more than once, and that avoids making mistakes such as writing digitalWrite instead of analogWrite (that one was easy to debug, I had much trickier ones with interrupts...)  A fun application is to control the motor with these small joysticks plugged on the analog pins. However, you want the joystick to control the acceleration, not the speed directly, so the reading from the joystick increases motorSpeed (add some delay) instead of being used directly. Thus, when motorSpeed is positive, you spin one way, when it's negative you go the other way, and when it's within -70..70, you just halt. If you go straightforward, it's fairly simple. Another one is to add end-switches, so you know your spider is at the top or at the bottom and you don't rely on time, as speed is rarely exactly the same both ways (mostly, but not quite). In my case, I want to deply a cinema screen when pressing a button in one way, stop when it's down, change the direction on the switch to have it rolled back up. your wiper motor is normally powerful enough to do that but you can simulate with normal small motors, no need to go with stepper motors (although it's a lot cleaner as the position is controlled by the motors). Just thinking of what you can do with limited coding...

Oh my lord you like cats. I made an arduino cat food automatic food cover to stop fly`s.

WOW I`ve meet a girl that likes wiper motors. I repair old 1960 Lucas wiper motors if you want a chat lol. Joking I`m too old. :)

I use 3 relay`s to control my wiper motor. One for power on and the other two for direction. The motor is used to cover my greenhouse up at night with a canopy. The arduino program memory and RTC lasts all winter outside in minus 10 sometimes.

It's obvious that you were going for a first time tutorial on Arduino so you left out so many things.  One piece of advice that you didn't cover is using functions.  Whenever you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again, just put it in a function so you only need to call that function.  My favorite trick is to make my own function and name it something like move(dir, speed);  Dir can be 1 or 0 and speed could be something like 1-100 to think of the speed in terms of percentage for easy coding at the top level.  You scale the percentage to your 70-255 in the function and can use float so you can use decimal percentages if you want to.

Cheers!

Like you said it was for beginners. We don't need to know about your function yet. Best to go step by step like she did perfectly.

​ @zorbzzsterio6406  right...I don't think he paid attention to the video

​ @zorbzzsterio6406 I believe his point was that if you find yourself typing the same 2+ lines of code over and over it is time to think about making a function and calling it instead. This is formally called structured coding.  Example: Several years ago a co-worker used the same two lines of code throughout a large C++ project repeatedly. I showed him that under some rare circumstances it would first work as intended but also cause his program to crash later. He defended his decision with "That will never happen, its all the OS fault" . What made it worse was any change to the program affected whether or not any of those code sequences could cause the crash.  After he moved on to another company I inherited his code base. The first thing I did was to search out the literal thousands of times he had used that sequence. I turned it onto a function and added 3 lines to prevent the crash error. This function was placed into a common library. The end result was that most of the random crashes went away immediately.   Creating a function from this repeated sequence allowed me to make the code easier to read, fine tune the functionality to eliminate crashes, and made the executable marginally smaller. This was at the expense of making program theoretically a couple microseconds slower, but the human operating it couldn't tell the difference.

@davidrush4908 this video I for beginners. Why don’t you smart asre’s go somewhere else and exercise your egos.

She is trying to keep it simple for total beginners. If you are the expert you are only here to criticize so go away.

Todos nós tivemos um começo antes.  Imagine você começar aos 66 anos.  A garota esta de parabéns.

In that situation you'd also define a constant for forward or reverse for the direction. You will forget if 0 is forward or 1 is forward. Most code and always be improved.

What if I don't need super cool movement? Will this work for mediocre movement?

@edisont.picard4112  Then you probably don't need to write functions in the first place.  All of the programming tricks are to help the programmer to make his life easier.  It's good to know the tricks and then do whatever you want to as you feel.  But as soon as you start working professionally your peers get really picky really fast.  And your boss will mandate certain practises.  But if you're just playing around on your own or even doing it for money but nobody buy you will see your code, do whatever you want.

Perhaps you need your own channel

@balonkysnacker8797  I have thought about that. she is actually pretty good but some of the stuff I watch is definitely a notch below what I might do.  My problem is the same as with writing.  First, I need to have something I want to say.  I could out yet another tutorial on how to solder of some cool project.  Or I could just strap on a go pro while I work on my car.  Usually I don't think about that until I'm finished though.  I could just make it random stuff that I do or musings on politics.  But all of that is already done very well by other people.  So I just watch them.

Thank God!!! A man chimes in to save the day!  What would we do without insecure, know-it-all males, that have to fix women's technical explanations to show their "superiority"!  We are saved now!

Woman bad man good

@Bbcsupremacy  I said nothing about sex.  I like her.

@dougcox835  gender*

Will you Marry me LOL !!  Loved the entire video and with your explanation I may try doing something I have always feared trying. Video and commentary was well done, Thank you

ขอบคุณมากครับ

Great Job, really I learned and enjoyed it, Thanks

please please do it with diy encoders.

Wowa your such a good teacher I’m wanting to learn this code to control a single axis solar tracker “slew drive” Base on an astronomical clock at a given global location, I did experiment with chat gpt on the above, it virtually wrote the code, I do understand once  I get all the hardware setup I can then determine the travel   time it takes the motor to travel from start to finish (east / west) in short we already have another dual  axis solar tracker system running perfectly (was a bought controller from the USA) But wanting to setup the above mentioned.

very well explained.

I am so glad I came across your channel. I really appreciate your clear and concise instructions and explanations. Subscribed.

this helped me and my son get started as]ecialy with the codeing

awesome explanation, really appreciate your work on this

Usually it's many projects at once. And the thing is there's not enough time in a day. And the only thing bottle necking is my brain. 😅

Hi, I build aquaculture systems in third world countries and I often need Arduino type programming on my 12 volt pumps.  This video was great in explaining a lot to me.  You are a fantastic teacher (my background is education).  Anyway, wouldn't it be great to connect your community to small food and energy systems.  With your help we could empower a local secondary school to build such system.  Let me know if you are interested in those kinds of projects.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33t8BxGOCkg&t=5s

great teaching

Great Video. Thank you so much

Very noisy woman!

Just built this and could not have done it without your excellent video!

Spiderbots need to properly scuttle, otherwise they're just a bit boring!

I happened across your channel I guess because I'm an avid Arduino fan. I'm watching this video and was trying to figure out how I knew you and bam it calls to me, AGG. Glad I found you here! PS. AGG was so much better when you were on it, I no longer watch it. 👍🏻

Great tutorial 👍  Disappointed the spider on a string was a no-show.

Do you have a video on a pet feeder or dog water bowl filler upperer? Excellent video. Subscribed

subscribed.please teach us more about arduino and what it can do.Thanks

I hope it helps you with your project! Let me know if you'd like me to cover a specific topic.

Your Mum!

Awesome! What project are you building with a motor?

So true!

@RachelDeBarrosLive  You know ... I woke in the middle of the night a couple of days ago and I thought about this ... and I wondered if the skull could be made a lot creepier and scuttlier if the legs were connected in from above.  This would give (I think) more room for the mechatronics, and lower the centre of gravity too.  Why did I wake in the middle of the night thinking about mechatronic skull spiders?  Doesn't everyone?

I'm glad you found me! I love working on cars but my other passion is electronics, motorized props and animatronics.

​ @RachelDeBarrosLive  I love them too, it's amazing what we can do today with an Arduino or esp32, some servos, led and cardboard. https://youtu.be/BaDGpLDzKeM?feature=shared

🤣 🕷

Not yet! But I'm sure I can whip up a bread board prototype that people can modify from there!

@RachelDeBarrosLive  thank you that would be awesome x

Thanks for this fantastic video! It's exactly what I've been wanting to do and you really made it clear and fun. I'm totally new to all this and this all makes clear sense.

Best Arduino demo I've seen so far.  Thanks for the information, great teaching technique.

Hi, thought this was such a great vid and it's exactly the thing I have been trying to do. I was intending to use a nano but can't get it to work. I have ordered an arduino uno and I will try again. I will you know if I get there. Thanks, without your video I wouldn't even attempt it.         Regards Paul

4:20 "It can deliver seven amps of power?" Must be something wrong with my Physics book here :-)

I was skeptical, but then I saw the delorean in the background.

Hi Rachel, my name is Bruce and I must say your video was excellent. Out of all the videos I have watched, yous was clear and very well explained. Seeing you type the code made it easier to follow.   Do you have a video that explains how to code for motor control for speed/direction and position (PID).  Have you ever programed the Seeed Studio XIAO SAMD21? I designed it into my product because of the small size.  I have developed a Powered Clutch system for motorcycles. Using the Seeeduino XAIO,  a Pololu motor driver. a Pololu magnetic encoder on the motor shaft, as well as to two limit switches for protection. It operates using an analog slide pot mounted to the clutch handle which sends a variable signal to the Arduino to drive the motor speed and direction and to the correct position.  Your help would be greatly appreciated. I can send you a lot more details about this product/project, or you can see it at www.AdaptiveTechnologyLLC.com.   Thanks, Bruce Milligan info@AdaptiveTechnologyLLC,com

Very very good teacher

// Here is a simpler way to do the  motor direction // in this code the (!) makes a 1 into a 0 and a 0 into a 1...  // option 1 int motorSpeeed = random(70,256); int direction = random(0,2); digitalWrite(IN1pin, direction); digitalWrite(IN2pin, !direction);// Look at (!) in front of direction. analogWrite(ENApin, motorSpeeed); Delay( 3000);   // option 2 int motorSpeeed = random(70,256); int direction = random(0,2); digitalWrite(IN1pin, direction); digitalWrite(IN2pin, !digitalRead(IN1pin));// Look at (!) in front of digitalRead. analogWrite(ENApin, motorSpeeed); Delay( 3000);   // Try it

Try "perlin noise" for a smooth randomness.  Its not so jerky,  The Coding Train's channel introduced to me way back and its perfect for random stuff that you dont want to be jerky but still random.  They use it in video games for things like grass waving , trees etc.   I put it as the delay for the blink sketch and it has nice transition between fast and slow pulses.  I got the code from chatgtp for the perlin noise functoin and it worked great,   Although im sure there are perlin noise libraries out there but if iremember right chatgtp didnt need any libraries  other than simple math to make it work.

Thanks so much for this video, great intro for working with Arduino and motors. Quick question: when I unplug the Arduino from the computer, it shuts off. I have a 12v 2.5 amp plug going into the driver motor module, why wont the Arduino operate without being plugged into computer? Thanks again!

Lady, you surely have a gift. I need instructions for an RC motorized tank. Seems I cannot find the info anywhere. Can you take this to a Flysky with Audrino programming?

I is always nice to watch different Arduino videos.  Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and Arduino projects are great learning tools.  🥳    Thank you Rachel.   👧  Most interesting.  This project might be nice for a telescope star tracker add-on?  🌟  PWM SPEED CONTROL: enable signal terminal (ENA) input PWM can regulate speed, PWM frequency range 0-10KHZ.??

Hmmm, how about an automated pet feeder? BTW, how is Ripley?

Not sure if you mentioned it or not, but I believe if you bring both IN1 & IN2 high, that provides a braking function (pretty common with h-bridges).  In fact, I think your random function can cause the motor to brake when both are high and you can see that behavior in your video.

Look up IIC I2C TB6612 Mosfet Stepper Motor PCA9685 PWM Servo Driver Shield V2   For your spider. It can control up to four dc motors. 1.2 amp per motor up to 3 amp peak. That should be more than enough to drive those little motors. will save you time and effort. AND wiring.

Squiggly Pins are the Boss. MOSFETs are clean and simple, but piggy backing four L293Ds to make a 4.8 Amp driver is top shelf hacking.  Good Show

How many amps does the motor run?

Thank you so much for sharing this!

This is a fantastic approach to introducing motor controllers, power requirements and coding to folks 👍

i'm familiar with the hardware, but as usual watching you as I do... I always learn something new!!  😊😊😊😊😊 🍗🍗🍗

Keep me posted on your project and let me know if you'd like me to cover any other topics!

Let me know how you make out with the new board!

Had a nightmare with both uno and nano, pretty sure I did follow your input word for word etc. messed and tried over and over finally got it to verify a very simple program and then it won't upload. Is this due to my internet speed being slow (1 megabite per second download speed)? slowly loosing the will to live! No I am fine just frustrated. cheers Paul Happy new year  @RachelDeBarrosLive

@RachelDeBarrosLive  Sorry for delay, not been very well, but good news I've got my motor running forwards and reverse with my nano. OVER the moon it was an upload problem. Will check it out and let you know, (would have to check it out, can't risk giving you wrong info) and yes cats do rule as you said.

Yes, technically power is in watts but these workshops are done live so I don't always catch everything 😄

Nice job! I'm going to try this out 👍

Great question! While the Arduino is plugged into the computer via USB, it is both receiving power and able to receive data (code uploads). Also, whatever other modules you have hooked up to the 5V pin of the Arduino is also getting power (the motor driver module). Once you unplug the Arduino from the computer, it stops getting power (although the code remains stored in the microcontroller).  The 12V 2.5A power supply you have connected to the motor driver module only powers the motor. The Arduino must be powered separately. It can be powered either through the USB port or the barrel jack right next to it. If your project doesn't need to move around you can use a separate 9-12V power adapter to power your Arduino. I've also used portable phone chargers to power the Arduino through the USB port.  Let me know how you make out!

That would make a great tutorial! I see that most people using Flysky controllers use the IBusBM library. I'll have to dig a little deeper to see what I find.

The telescope project would be a great one to try!

I am learning the Raspberry Pi Pico W , MPU6050, Thonny MicroPython.   Thank you. Bye.

My tablet does not have a compass, so google skymap does not work on it.   I was wanting to figure out how to patch a MPU9250 into my tablet wirelessly,  so that I could use my tablet as a telescope viewfinder to see what star I am pointed at...

Ripley is doing great, but I know she'd try and hack the feeder to dispense at her command 🤣

@RachelDeBarrosLive   - Oh that’s probably true- I forgot who her mom is…😊

Yep, indeed it does! I can't remember if it's in this edited down version of the live stream or not but that's a good point to include in the tutorial on the website for everyone. Thanks for the catch!

@RachelDeBarrosLive  Actually, I just re-watched it and you do mention that.  Thanks! 😊

Great suggestion! That will definitely help tidy things up a bit.

@RachelDeBarrosLive  YW

😄

This wiper motor needs 12V 5A to run. The motor driver module I'm using (XY-160D) can deliver up to 7A.

Glad you enjoyed it! Let me know if there are any other topics you'd like to see covered.

@RachelDeBarrosLive  That's a perfect video for me to learn how to control a motor with Arduino. Would it be the same logic when dealing with a stepper motor?

Glad you liked it! Let me know if there's any topic you'd like to see.

I've been testing some paint ideas for my latex zombie flexy head and I think acrylic works best so far. Although if I pitch the paint too hard it does crack but it can withstand some bending. It will make for a great future live workshop!

@RachelDeBarrosLive  - I bought a starter oil paint kit, too. I can hardly wait for the next zoom workshop to experiment some more! 🤩🤩🤩🤩

great video I wish you made videos more frequent

Cool. Enjoyed this very much. By the way, how'd that vacuum former turn out?

Sensational very good

Me too! I enjoy putting these together and I learn a lot too.

Glad you like it! My vacuum form machine worked great. One of the heating elements had a tiny hairline crack in it that I never noticed until recently because it got visibly worse from moving the machine around the shop. Against my better judgement, I tried using a high-temp sealer (rated for over 400 degrees) but it melted during my first test. I'm debating whether to hunt down another toaster oven or just use a smoker heating element. I'm leaning towards the smoker one because there would be no wiring. The heating element plugs right into the wall. Plus it would be much easier to replace down the road. I'll keep you all posted!

Thank you so much 😀
