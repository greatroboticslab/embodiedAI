1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
This is a full wave bridge rectifier.

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,180
It's used to power electronic circuits,

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,480
so we're going to learn in detail how they work in this video.

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,440
Electricity is dangerous and can be fatal.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:18,500
You must be qualified and competent to carry out any electrical work.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,920
Full bridge rectifiers look like this.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,940
There are many shapes and sizes,

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,600
but they essentially consist of four diodes in a certain arrangement.

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,440
They are usually aligned in a diamond configuration,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,980
but they can be aligned in other ways such as these.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,380
We typically find them represented on engineering drawings like this,

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,080
this being the symbol for a diode.

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,060
The arrow points in the direction of conventional current.

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,460
This shows that AC electricity is the input and DC electricity is the output.

15
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:01,860
The full bridge rectifier converts AC alternating current into DC direct current.

16
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:03,580
Why is that important?

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,680
Because the power outlets in our homes provide AC,

18
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,880
but our electrical devices use DC,

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
so we need to convert the AC into DC electricity.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,840
For example, a laptop charger takes AC from the power outlet

21
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,460
and converts this to DC to power the laptop.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,840
If you look at the power adapter for your laptop and other electronic devices,

23
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,420
the manufacturer's label tells you it's converting AC to DC.

24
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:41,220
In this example, it states that it needs an input of between 100 and 240 volts

25
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,580
with the symbol for AC electricity,

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,920
and this will draw 1.5 amps of current.

27
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,300
It will then output 19.5 volts of DC electricity

28
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,520
and 3.33 amps of current.

29
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,920
Notice that it also states 50 to 60 hertz.

30
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,480
This is the AC frequency and we'll look at that in just a moment.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,320
In AC electricity, the voltage and current constantly change direction

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
between forwards and backwards.

33
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,880
That's because there's a magnetic field in the AC generator

34
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,020
which essentially pushes and pulls electrons in the wires.

35
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,240
This is therefore changing between positive and negative values

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,400
as it flows forwards and backwards.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,080
The voltage is not constant

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,780
even though the multimeter will make it look like it is.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,620
If we plotted this, we get a sine wave pattern.

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,260
The voltage changes between a peak positive and a peak negative value

41
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,440
as the maximum intensity of the magnetic field

42
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,060
passes the coils of wire inside the AC generator.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,760
This example reaches 170 volts at its peaks.

44
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,000
So if we plotted these values,

45
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,740
we have positive and negative peaks of 170 volts.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,560
If we took the average of these values, we would get 0 volts.

47
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,520
That's not very useful.

48
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,500
So a clever engineer decided to use the root mean squared voltage.

49
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,180
That is what our multimeters calculate

50
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,880
when we connect them to the electrical outlets.

51
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,240
To find the peak voltage,

52
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
we multiply the root mean squared voltage

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,940
by the square root of 2,

54
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,640
which is roughly 1.41.

55
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,300
To find the RMS voltage,

56
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,600
we divide the peak voltage by 0.707.

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,100
For example, here I have a North American,

58
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,820
British, Australian and European power outlets.

59
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,720
This multimeter shows basic waveforms

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,480
and when I connect to any of these

61
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,220
between the phase and neutral,

62
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,000
we see a sine wave,

63
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,140
which is indicating this is AC electricity.

64
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,200
Notice that the British and European outlets are 230 volts.

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,540
The Australian outlet is 240 volts,

66
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,620
but all three of these are at a frequency of 50 hertz.

67
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,440
However, the North American outlets read 120 volts

68
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,840
at a frequency of 60 hertz.

69
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,080
The frequency is measured in hertz,

70
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,000
but this just means the sine wave is repeating

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
60 times per second in the North American electrical systems

72
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
and 50 times per second in the rest of the world.

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,500
The voltage is lower in the North American system

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,660
at 120 volts,

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,600
whereas it's 230 to 240 volts

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,900
in the rest of the world,

77
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,960
although there are some exceptions,

78
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,780
but we won't go into that in this video.

79
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,720
The peak voltage of each electrical system

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
is therefore as follows.

81
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,520
In DC electricity,

82
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,460
the voltage is constant

83
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,920
and in the positive region.

84
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,680
The electrons do not reverse.

85
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,200
They all flow in just one direction.

86
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,880
So if I measure this battery,

87
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,020
we see a flat line in the positive region

88
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,260
at around 1.5 volts.

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,960
So this is DC electricity.

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,420
This solar panel also produces DC.

91
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,800
We can see it produces a flat line

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,940
at around 4 volts on the multimeter.

93
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,400
We can use this adapter to measure a USB port.

94
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,380
We can see it's providing around 5 volts DC.

95
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,580
And if we plot this with the other multimeter,

96
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,060
we again see a constant flat line

97
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,700
indicating this is DC electricity.

98
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,400
This is a four-wave bridge rectifier.

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,360
On these input terminals,

100
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,000
we see around 12 volts AC with a sine wave.

101
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,420
And on these output terminals,

102
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,420
we see around 14 volts of DC.

103
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,780
So this device is converting AC to DC.

104
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,980
The voltage is slightly higher on the output

105
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,420
because of the capacitor.

106
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,020
And we'll see why that is later on in this video.

107
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,360
Now, you need to remember

108
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,240
that rectifiers will only convert AC to DC.

109
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,540
It cannot convert DC into AC.

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,060
For that, we would need an inverter

111
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,840
which uses special electronic components

112
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,060
to achieve that,

113
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,280
but we won't cover that in this video.

114
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,500
By the way,

115
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,940
we have covered how power inverters work

116
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,920
in detail in our previous video.

117
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,160
Links can be found in the video description

118
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
down below for that.

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,640
The rectifier consists of diodes.

120
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,400
A diode is a semiconductor device

121
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,580
which allows current to flow through it,

122
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,860
but in only one direction.

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,040
So if we connect this lamp to a DC power supply,

124
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,240
it will illuminate.

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,200
We can reverse the leads

126
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,560
and it will still illuminate.

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,480
If I place a diode on the red wire

128
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,220
and connect this to the positive,

129
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,360
it will again illuminate.

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,860
But now, when I reverse the leads,

131
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,560
the diode blocks the current

132
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,120
and the lamp remains off.

133
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,120
So it only allows current to flow in one direction

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,220
and we can therefore use this

135
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,560
to control the direction of current in a circuit

136
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,780
to form DC electricity.

137
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's see some different ways

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,920
of how that's achieved.

139
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,340
If we looked at an AC supply

140
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,260
with a step-down transformer

141
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:32,400
which simply reduces the voltage to a safer level,

142
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,500
the electrons are flowing forwards and backwards.

143
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,940
So the load experiences an AC sine wave.

144
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,040
The load could be anything from a resistor,

145
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,640
a lamp, a motor, etc.

146
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,080
If we inserted a diode,

147
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,360
the diode will only allow current to flow in one direction.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,780
So the load now experiences a pulsating waveform.

149
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,020
The negative half of the sine wave is currently being blocked.

150
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:07,080
We can reverse the diode to block the positive half and only allow the negative half.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,140
This is therefore a half wave rectifier.

152
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:13,140
The output is technically DC

153
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,200
because the electrons only flow in one direction.

154
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,760
It's just not a very good DC output as it's not completely flat.

155
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,820
Here I have a resistor which is connected to a low voltage AC supply.

156
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,720
We see on the oscilloscope the AC sine wave.

157
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,960
When I connect a diode in series with this,

158
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,520
the oscilloscope shows a pulsating pattern in the positive region.

159
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:50,000
If I connect two lamps in parallel, one with a diode,

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,800
we see that the one without the diode is brighter

161
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,080
because it's using the full waveform.

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,780
The other lamp is dimmer because it's only using half of this waveform.

163
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,220
The diode is blocking the other half.

164
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,580
If we view this in slow motion,

165
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,580
we can see that the diode connected lamp is flickering more

166
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,480
because of the gaps in power.

167
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,580
Therefore, we can use this for simple circuits such as lighting

168
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,220
or perhaps charging some simple batteries.

169
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,220
But we can't use this for electronics

170
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,980
as the components need constant power.

171
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,200
Other ways they will not work correctly.

172
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,940
We can add a capacitor in parallel with the load

173
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,260
to improve the output.

174
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,740
We'll look at that later on in this video.

175
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
We can add a capacitor in parallel with the power of the transformer.

176
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,580
We can add a capacitor in parallel with the power of the transformer.

177
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,580
A better improvement is to use a full wave rectifier.

178
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,580
And there are two main ways to do that.

179
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:52,580
We can create a full wave rectifier simply by using a center tap transformer and two diodes.

180
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:57,700
A center tap transformer just has another wire on the secondary side

181
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,220
which is connected to the center of the transformer coil.

182
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:07,400
This allows us to use the full length of the transformer coil or just half of it.

183
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Because the current constantly reverses in AC electricity

184
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,400
while in the positive or forward half

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,400
the current flows through diode one and into the load

186
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
and then back to the transformer via the center tapped wire.

187
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Diode two is blocking the current so it can't return through here.

188
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Only half the transformer coil is therefore being used.

189
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:37,400
In the reverse or negative half the current flows through diode two,

190
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
through the load and then back to the transformer.

191
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Diode one is blocking the current.

192
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
The current flows in one direction through the load.

193
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,400
In either case the current flows in just one direction through the load.

194
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,400
So it is considered DC.

195
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,400
But it is not smooth.

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
It is still pulsating.

197
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
There are just no gaps.

198
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,400
The negative half has been converted into a positive half.

199
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
The waveform is not smooth.

200
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,400
So we need to apply some filtering such as a capacitor.

201
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Again, we'll look in detail at that later on in this video.

202
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,400
The most common method used is the full wave bridge rectifier.

203
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
This uses four diodes.

204
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
The AC supply is connected between diode one and two.

205
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,400
With the neutral between three and four.

206
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:35,400
The DC positive output is connected between diode two and three.

207
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,400
And the negative between diode one and four.

208
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,400
In the positive half of the sine wave.

209
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,400
The current flows through diode two, through the load, through diode four,

210
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
and then back to the transformer.

211
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
In the negative half, the current flows through diode three,

212
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:59,400
through the load, through diode one, and then back to the transformer.

213
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,400
So the transformer is supplying an AC sine wave.

214
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,400
But the load is experiencing a rippled DC waveform because the current flows in just one direction.

215
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:16,400
In this example circuit, we can see that rectified waveform on the oscilloscope.

216
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,400
But this is not a flat DC output.

217
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,400
So we need to improve this by adding some filtering.

218
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Using a rectifier will result in a ripple in the waveform.

219
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,400
To smooth this out, we need to add some filters.

220
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,400
The basic method is to simply add an electrolytic capacitor in parallel to the load.

221
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,400
The capacitor charges during the increase in voltage and stores the electrons.

222
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
It then releases these during the decrease.

223
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,400
This therefore reduces the ripple.

224
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,400
The oscilloscope will show the peaks of each pulse.

225
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
But now the voltage doesn't decrease to zero.

226
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,400
It slowly declines until the pulse charges the capacitor again.

227
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:10,400
We can further reduce this by using a larger capacitor or by using multiple capacitors.

228
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:17,400
In this simple example, you can see the LED turns off as soon as the power is interrupted.

229
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:29,400
But if I placed a capacitor in parallel with the LED, it remains on because now the capacitor is discharging and powering the LED during the interruptions.

230
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,400
In this circuit, I have a lamp connected as the load.

231
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,400
The oscilloscope shows the rippled waveform.

232
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:43,400
When I add a small 10 microfarad capacitor, we see that it makes very little difference to the waveform.

233
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:50,400
When I use a 100 microfarad capacitor, we see the dip is no longer down to zero volts.

234
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,400
At 1000 microfarads, the ripple is very small.

235
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,400
At 2200 microfarads, it's nearly completely smooth.

236
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,400
This would be fine to use for many electronic circuits.

237
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
We could use multiple capacitors also.

238
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Here we have a 470 microfarad capacitor, which has made some difference.

239
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:19,400
But if I use two capacitors in parallel, we see the waveform is much more improved.

240
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,400
When using a capacitor, we need to place a bleeder resistor across the output.

241
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:32,400
This is a high value resistor, which will drain the capacitor when the circuit is off to keep us safe.

242
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:40,400
Notice with this circuit that when I switch it on, the capacitor charges quickly to over 15 volts.

243
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:47,400
But when I switch it off, the DC output is still at 15 volts because there is no load.

244
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:51,400
So the energy is still stored in the capacitor.

245
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,400
This could be very dangerous if the voltage is high.

246
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,400
In this example, I place a 4.7 kilo ohm resistor across the output.

247
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,400
We see the capacitor charges up to 15 volts.

248
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,400
And when I switch it off, the capacitor quickly discharges.

249
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:13,400
The electrons are flowing through the resistor, which discharges the capacitor.

250
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:20,400
We can also see that without a capacitor, the output voltage is lower than the input voltage

251
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,400
because of the voltage drop of the diodes.

252
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Here we have a simple 4-wave bridge rectifier.

253
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
On the input, we see there is 12 volts AC.

254
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,400
On the output, we have 10.5 volts of DC.

255
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:40,400
The voltage on the output is lower because of the diodes.

256
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Each diode has a voltage drop of around 0.7 volts.

257
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
If we look at this circuit with a diode and an LED,

258
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,400
we can measure across the diode to see a voltage drop of around 0.7 volts.

259
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:00,400
The current in our full bridge rectifier must pass through two diodes on the positive half

260
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,400
and two diodes on the negative half.

261
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,400
So the voltage drop combines and is around 1.4 to 1.5 volts.

262
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,400
So that is why the output will be reduced.

263
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,400
However, if we were to connect a capacitor across the output,

264
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,400
we will see that the output voltage is now higher than the input voltage.

265
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
How is that possible?

266
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:31,400
That's because the AC input is measuring the RMS voltage or the root mean squared.

267
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
This is not the peak voltage.

268
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,400
The peak voltage is 1.41 times higher than the RMS voltage.

269
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:45,400
The capacitors are charged up to the peak voltage and then release.

270
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
There will be a small voltage drop because of the diodes.

271
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:54,400
So the output is less than the peak input, but it will still be higher than the RMS input.

272
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:08,400
For example, if we had 12 volts RMS on the input, the peak voltage would be 12 volts multiplied by 1.41, which is 16.9 volts.

273
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
There will be a 0.7 volt drop here and here.

274
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,400
So 16.9 volts subtract 1.4 is 15.5 volts.

275
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
The capacitors are charged up to this voltage.

276
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,400
This is only the approximate answer though.

277
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:31,400
The amount of ripple and the actual voltage drop of the diodes will cause it to be slightly different in reality.

278
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,400
But we can see that the output is higher than the input.

279
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Another common filter is placing two capacitors in parallel with a series inductor between these.

280
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
This is used for circuits with larger loads.

281
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,400
The first capacitor smooths the ripple.

282
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,400
The inductor opposes the change in current and tries to keep it constant.

283
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:59,400
And the second capacitor, which is much smaller, will then smooth out the final remaining ripple.

284
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Additionally, we can also connect a voltage regulator to the output.

285
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:12,400
This is very common and allows some variation to the input, but it will provide a constant output voltage.

286
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,400
This again has capacitors on either side of the regulator to ensure a smooth,

287
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
DC output.

288
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Here we can see a real version, which is connected to a 12 volt AC supply.

289
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
And we see it has an output of around 5 volts DC.

290
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,400
