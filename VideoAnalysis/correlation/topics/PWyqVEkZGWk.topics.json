And you might be\nwondering, set up the motors, what does that even mean? Like, why would I have to set up the motors?\nWell, there are a few reasons why. Because you see, the flight controller, the brain of the\nquadcopter, needs to know which motor to spin up at which time. And it needs to know where that",

So those are the two main things. Now in this video,\nwe're going to cover how to set up the ESC protocol, which is not very hard. We're going to cover motor\norder, or used to be called motor mapping, and motor direction. And that's going to be how it spins.\nAnd then what you need to do if you want to spin props out, which is how I like to have my propellers\nspin. And I'm going to show you how to do all of that. The bad news is it can be kind of a complicated,\nor just not complicated, it can be confusing. And and maybe that's why your quadcopter isn't flying.\nAnd maybe it's not working, and you're frustrated. And I totally get that. The good news is Betaflight\nhas made it much easier.

And they can assemble that they have 1000s of components,\nand they can actually put all of them on the board so that it works and is ready to rock and roll when\nit comes to your door. So that's a pretty cool service. If you're not into PCBs, they also offer rapid\nprototyping services. So you could get something injection molded or 3d printed or sheet metal\nbended or even CNC'd out of various materials. So if that sounds interesting to you, check the link\ndown in the description of this video and tell them that I sent you if you want, but it probably won't\nmake a difference. Okay, now what we have what we're using today is this seven inch FPV drone that I\nbought secondhand. So it's kind of one of those things where like, you don't know exactly how it's\nbuilt or what's been going on. And this could be a situation where the motors aren't working,\nand it really is confusing to you. All right, step one, we need to determine what we're working with.\nSo in this case, we have a four in one ESC board, and it's mounted in the center of our quadcopter.\nThat's very common, like four in one ESCs are very, very common. Now spoiler alert, this time,\nit's actually been flipped over, it's been it's been rotated in a roll orientation, and it's been",
