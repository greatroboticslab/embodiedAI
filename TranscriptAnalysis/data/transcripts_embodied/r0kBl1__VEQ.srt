00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Today's video, we're going to be looking at a new stack from Team Motor.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,460
Now, this is the first official ever F7 flight controller,

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,700
and to be honest, the most feature-packed flight controller they've ever released.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,000
And not only that, it's bringing back memories from the old Omnibus.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,620
Now, first of all, if you don't know this or if you haven't seen my video,

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,580
this is one of the best 6S ESCs I've ever tested, ever used, and done noise testing on.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,260
So right out of the box, you're getting something proper here.

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,120
They also give us a PCB here.

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,620
So some of you are like, well, what the heck is this?

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:31,180
Well, this can be used for a couple things.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,840
It's to protect the flight controller,

12
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:38,540
or even use double-sided tape to hold a video transmitter, a receiver, something of that nature.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,280
Or if you have your battery straps coming in from the top of the frame,

14
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,940
that battery strap doesn't touch the flight controller,

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
because obviously the gyro is in there,

16
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,360
and doesn't move the flight controller and cause unwanted vibration.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,600
So it has many purposes.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,880
The only other company that usually does this is actually Maytec.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,160
So let's put this to the side.

20
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,540
Then we get to the flight controller.

21
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,880
The flight controller is pretty interesting.

22
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,380
And again, this is the first F7.

23
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:01,400
They're using the baby F7, which is the F722 here.

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,100
They have a lot of things going on here, like pit mode.

25
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,900
You can activate and deactivate.

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,960
However, there's no 9-volt regulator, but we're going to get into this in a bit.

27
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,200
And we've got a lot of options here that we have to enable and disable in order to get it to work.

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,740
But it seems pretty proper.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
Obviously, Gummi's inside.

30
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,280
And let's get into this, because I haven't gotten this far just yet.

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,600
I wanted to keep it preserved for you guys.

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
So here we've got two connectors down there, which we're going to come back to.

33
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,900
Here we have four screws, metal screws, very long for the stack.

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,360
So hopefully that'll fit most frames.

35
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,820
We also have our nice, trusty, low ESR capacitor, which is a Rubicon.

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,420
Awesome.

37
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,420
And it is a 35-volt, 470 microfarad.

38
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,420
Really great.

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,420
You're going to need this.

40
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,540
You always need this, especially on 6S ESCs.

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,320
Actually, on everything.

42
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,840
They also give us some extra gummies.

43
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,880
They give us five, to be exact, which is really great.

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,100
There's already four on this one.

45
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:58,040
And they've also given us four PCB wires or race wire, whatever you want to call these, in the packaging, which is really great.

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,600
And let's see what else.

47
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,480
Just spacers, the nuts and everything.

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,460
So that's really nice.

49
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,940
Actually, I didn't know they had this in here.

50
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,760
And even the XT60, pre-made, really great.

51
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,340
Also very, very thick and very, very long.

52
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,040
Recommended to shorten this, like, halfway is good here.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,760
The longer this is, the more noise will be in your system.

54
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,520
And it also gives us two connectors.

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,460
Now, be careful how you connect them, because one says ESC, one says FC.

56
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,140
It's really great.

57
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,800
They've done that.

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,960
And you'll be like, well, why?

59
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,120
They're just going straight across.

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,880
Well, if you go like this, you'll see that they're actually inverted.

61
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,560
So I'll actually zoom in here.

62
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,900
So this is the top side.

63
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,920
And if they weren't inverted, those black wires would be on the same place.

64
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,740
So keep that in mind.

65
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,120
You could blow this whole thing up if you put these backwards.

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,000
So where it says ESC, you plug it into this thing.

67
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,620
Where it says FC, you plug it into the other thing.

68
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,700
That looks like this.

69
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,480
And you're good to go.

70
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,780
So let's take a closer look at the flight controller.

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,580
And the ESC, there's really nothing to say about it.

72
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,540
Then it's really good.

73
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,140
Tested it.

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,160
Have it on a couple of builds.

75
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,540
I even blew a battery and motors.

76
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,540
And the ESC still functions, which says a lot.

77
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,280
And it does have really great, what is it called?

78
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,220
Throttle response, which means no jitters.

79
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,300
Especially on 6S, it needs a very fast microcontroller unit.

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,760
And just an overall great design.

81
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,020
And this actually gets an A plus in my opinion.

82
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,380
Now, this thing also has a 10 volt regulator.

83
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,920
However, it's actually not being utilized, which we'll cover in a bit here.

84
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,180
So this has telemetry.

85
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,240
It's a BLHeli 32.

86
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,420
And everything you want in a 6S ESC.

87
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,560
This is it right here.

88
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,380
So let's put this to the side for now.

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,040
And let's start covering the flight controller.

90
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Because the ESC has a really nice feature, if you might say.

91
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,080
If you want to call it a feature.

92
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,200
And the flight controller here does not utilize that feature.

93
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,280
But I can understand why.

94
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,760
Because of another feature they've added.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,200
All right.

96
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,460
So now we're going to take a look at the flight controller.

97
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,900
See the overall board layout.

98
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
And what we can see is there's some change of heart, maybe.

99
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,140
I think that's the way you put it.

100
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,780
Some changes have been made here.

101
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,180
And you can easily spot those.

102
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,820
So here we have our 16 megabyte of flash memory.

103
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,260
So that's really great for black box since we don't have SD card expansion.

104
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,800
Our MPU 6000 gyro is right here.

105
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,100
And here, I think that we're going to do some sort of either sensor fusion.

106
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,500
Or dual gyro setups.

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,060
Where like an ICM and MPU.

108
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,900
But they've gone ahead and removed that.

109
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,460
But the legs are still available here.

110
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,860
Or the traces for the other gyro.

111
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,080
Here they're probably going to use just a full blown resistor.

112
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,440
Instead of these four right here.

113
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,140
Which is kind of like a multi resistor.

114
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,180
I don't know what the actual real name is for these.

115
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,700
But instead of this one, this one, this one.

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,540
There's another one.

117
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,400
Yeah, these two right here.

118
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,580
They would have just used this.

119
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,200
But I guess they changed their mind here.

120
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,100
What else do we have?

121
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,680
Here we have our switching regulator.

122
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,860
It's just a 5 volt regulator.

123
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,800
And again, there's no 10 volt regulator.

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,480
There is just a 5 volt and a 3.3 volt.

125
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,560
So that pretty much covers this side of the board.

126
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,500
On the back side, nothing special either.

127
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,180
No barometer.

128
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,080
But we do have a transistor.

129
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,340
I think this is the transistor that's in charge of pit mode.

130
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,680
Now this is a real pit mode.

131
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Where it actually disconnects the power to your video transmitter.

132
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,300
And that would be enabled from here.

133
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,960
So you're going to have to do some bridges before you get this thing completely going.

134
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,900
And this is where I'm going to cover in this video.

135
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,160
We have our OSD right here.

136
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,900
Little baby tantalum capacitors.

137
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Which OSD is this one?

138
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,780
This is the 3.3 volt OSD here.

139
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,620
So this is a 3.3 volt.

140
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,400
It's a Chinese one.

141
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,520
And what else do we have?

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,400
Little baby tantalum capacitors.

143
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,040
Our F7.

144
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,940
Some diode here.

145
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,080
The diode's coming in, I think, from the main battery voltage.

146
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,420
Now it's also really nice.

147
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,120
This takes raw battery voltage between, I think, basically up to 6S.

148
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,760
And I think a minimum of 2S.

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,160
Just check the documentation.

150
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,240
The link's down below.

151
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,500
You can go ahead and check this stack up.

152
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,760
So now let's cover how we would go about connecting him.

153
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,520
So the first thing we need to find is the arrow.

154
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,660
And this arrow should be up top and pointing towards the camera.

155
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,900
So if our camera was right here, this would be installed on our quadcopter.

156
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,540
Just like this.

157
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,300
And next thing we have is the video transmitter.

158
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,420
Also the camera.

159
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,480
And the receiver can be placed on any R-pad, basically.

160
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,500
Because it's an F7.

161
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,060
So it won't matter if you have S-Bus, I-Bus, FlySky, FRSky, or Spectrum.

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,100
You can put them on any R-pad.

163
00:05:59,200 --> 00:05:59,660
It'll work.

164
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,000
However, I don't recommend you put it on RX4.

165
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,080
Because RX4 is being utilized for the telemetry here.

166
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,180
Keep that in mind.

167
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,600
Now, here on the left side, we have camera.

168
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,040
So we have our ground, our positive.

169
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,440
So ground would be the black wire for your camera.

170
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,640
The positive is going to be the red.

171
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,600
CC is camera control.

172
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:21,740
So if your camera has OSD, you can actually connect the wire here.

173
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,080
It'll enable you to control the OSD of the camera and change its settings, which is really cool.

174
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,700
And we have the video input.

175
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,680
This would be the yellow wire from your camera.

176
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,560
Keep that in mind.

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,320
However, if you plug it like that, the camera is not going to boot.

178
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,780
Because you're going to have to bridge this right here.

179
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,500
So if you wanted your camera to get 5 volts, which is highly recommended.

180
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,520
And all cameras just basically take 5 volts and up.

181
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,860
But the safe side is just to give them 5 volts.

182
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,040
Would be to bridge this left one with this middle one.

183
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,960
And that would give it 5 volts.

184
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,380
But if you wanted to give it battery voltage for the camera,

185
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,380
then you're going to have to bridge the middle one with the battery voltage.

186
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,940
So keep that in mind.

187
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,840
Now, I never recommend adding or giving straight battery voltage to the camera

188
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,560
because the onboard filtration for the cameras is absolute trash.

189
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,680
So keep that in mind.

190
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,700
And I've seen that happen a couple times.

191
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,820
So it's recommended just to give them from whatever regulator you have.

192
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,440
9, 10, 5 volts.

193
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,600
So 5 volt here is what I would do on mine.

194
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,080
And our camera is done there.

195
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,460
Now, here is the video transmitter part.

196
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:29,360
Now, the video transmitter can also give 5 volt or battery voltage.

197
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,120
Again, most likely going to be going battery voltage.

198
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,680
And the way we would connect this would be the yellow wire would go to the VO,

199
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,300
which means video output,

200
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,900
because the video would come in from the camera to the video input.

201
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,980
Go inside.

202
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:42,820
Go to this chip.

203
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,700
Put the on-screen display on.

204
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,620
And pop it out down to your goggles from your video transmitter.

205
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,120
Now, T3 here would be for smart audio.

206
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,220
And with that or any other protocol that allow you to change the channel

207
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:57,240
and output power through the on-screen display.

208
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
So that's where you want to put that.

209
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,740
And now, R3 would be not usable anymore.

210
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,700
So keep that in mind.

211
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,020
So if one of the pads that have a T and R, for example, now the T3 is used,

212
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,420
we're not going to be able to use the R3 for anything else.

213
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,300
So keep that in mind.

214
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,040
Very important to take note of that.

215
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,300
And here we have our plus and our minus.

216
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,000
Plus is going to be the red wire for your video transmitter.

217
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,520
And minus is going to be the black wire.

218
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,160
Now, if your video transmitter takes battery voltage,

219
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,540
you'd bridge the left one with the middle one.

220
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,940
If it takes 5 volts, you'd bridge the right one with the middle one.

221
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,980
And you're set to go.

222
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,140
If you don't bridge these, these two won't get power.

223
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,040
Keep that in mind.

224
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,380
Also, a little nice tip or trick, if you might not know this.

225
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,580
If you're unable to bridge it, no matter what the hell you did,

226
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,260
then you could just take your red wire, put it to battery right there.

227
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,420
Because that's basically battery right there.

228
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,660
It would be the same thing.

229
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,360
And you can do that and get away with it.

230
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,340
So yeah, if you didn't want to bridge them, you can do that.

231
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,100
If you wanted 5 volt, you could just solder it to this guy and you're good to go.

232
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,460
Same thing goes for that one.

233
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,020
Next, let's cover the receiver.

234
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,740
How would we connect our receiver?

235
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,480
Now, IBUS and Spectrum.

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,040
I mean, sorry.

237
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,680
Yeah, IBUS, Spectrum and FR Sky, whatever protocol you're using,

238
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,740
is going to be connected in this area right here.

239
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,280
The only difference is with Spectrum is you're going to give it possibly 3.3 volts

240
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,740
because those take 3.3 volts.

241
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,380
Anyways, let's cover IBUS and SBUS.

242
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,720
So if you had an IBUS, Flag Sky or an FR Sky receiver,

243
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,340
you'd want to put the SBUS or IBUS signal on the R5 right here.

244
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,000
That's where I would want to put it.

245
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
So you put it right there.

246
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,480
And then you want to put the black wire, which is the ground, right here on the G.

247
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,220
And this would be 5 volts.

248
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,560
So that would be the red wire.

249
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,360
And then now you have a connected receiver.

250
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,580
So you're good in that perspective.

251
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,820
Now, Spectrum, usually 3.3 volts.

252
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,260
I would still put the signal on R5.

253
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,880
I would still give it ground.

254
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,000
But instead of 5 volts, I would give it 3.3 volts for the red wire.

255
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,240
And you're good.

256
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,220
Just that's it.

257
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,780
And this is really cool because it even supports PPM without having to do anything.

258
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,920
So if you're still using a receiver that uses PPM,

259
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,040
you just take it right there and you're good to go.

260
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,600
Now, if we take a closer look here, we also see we have an R3 and a T3 pad.

261
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,180
However, you will not be able to use these two if you're using the T3 up here.

262
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,060
So keep that in mind.

263
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,620
So if you are using smart audio or some kind of a TRAMP protocol,

264
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,340
you can't use these for anything else.

265
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,760
So keep that in mind and don't screw up.

266
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,740
We also have a dedicated RSSI pad.

267
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:26,040
So if your receiver gives some sort of RSSI signal from a dedicated wire,

268
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,020
then you can just install that there and you should have that set up.

269
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,600
And here we see we have R1 and T1.

270
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,580
Now, you'll be able to use this for whatever your heart desires,

271
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,600
which is really great.

272
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,260
And you can use any sensor or anything.

273
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,100
For example, I would actually possibly put TBS Crossfire here

274
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,480
because, you know, that's how it would work.

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,560
It uses a full UR, the R and the T.

276
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,060
I'll probably put the, you know, TBS Crossfire right here

277
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,380
and I'll be good to go.

278
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,440
Now, if we take a look on this side right here,

279
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,440
we see we have E5 and E6.

280
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,100
You know, like what the hell is E5 and E6?

281
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,080
These are two extra motor output signals

282
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,220
that can be remapped to do anything you want,

283
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,080
which is also something really nice that they've done that here.

284
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,260
They didn't have to, but it's also, you know,

285
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,440
it's just a little couple extra pads.

286
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,480
You can do whatever you want with,

287
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,560
not whatever you want with, but you can do quite a lot with.

288
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,580
Here we have an R2 and a T2,

289
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
which is not being used by anything else.

290
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,660
So you'll be able to use these for anything you wanted to,

291
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,480
which is really great.

292
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,560
And we also have a ground 5 volt, SCL and SDA.

293
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,000
These would be for like a magnometer.

294
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,860
Some sensors use these pads so you can connect those there.

295
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,420
And then this is very important.

296
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:37,580
Now, R4 and T4, if you're using ESC telemetry,

297
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,060
it's on RX4 right here.

298
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,620
So you're not gonna be able to use these.

299
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,520
So keep that in mind.

300
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,800
If you have the, you know, the connector with this ESC plugged in

301
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,880
and ESC telemetry working,

302
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,620
these are basically used up.

303
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,700
You can't use these two,

304
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,160
which is something very important to take note of here.

305
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,960
Now, if you take a look at the pads here,

306
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,000
also this connector,

307
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,020
but we're gonna take a look at the pads

308
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,800
because it's the same thing.

309
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,560
For example, if you're not using the same ESC,

310
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,380
you're gonna have to solder to this right here,

311
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,560
unless you wanna play with the wires.

312
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,400
But if you have to solder, it's very simple.

313
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,180
Everything is really well labeled here.

314
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,240
For example, here's the RX4.

315
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,800
This would be for the ESC telemetry.

316
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,000
Then the current wire, motors 1, 2, 3, and 4.

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,740
And then we have positive.

318
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,600
This would be battery voltage.

319
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,660
So up to 6S.

320
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,200
So keep that in mind, not 5 volt.

321
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,660
This would be battery voltage.

322
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,800
And then this would be a ground here.

323
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,840
And here we have another ground 5 volt buzzer and LED.

324
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,920
These are separate here.

325
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,780
These are, if you wanted to connect a buzzer and or LEDs,

326
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,920
this is where you'd connect them right here.

327
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,700
So for example, for connecting a buzzer,

328
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,680
I'd put the buzzer positive on 5 volt

329
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,980
and the negative on buzz minus.

330
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,100
It's very important because the buzzers get initialized

331
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,860
through the ground here.

332
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,280
LED, kind of the same thing,

333
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,040
but I wouldn't use the buzzer ground.

334
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,040
I would give it ground, which is a black wire.

335
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,800
Red wire is the 5 volt.

336
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,280
And then the LED signal here.

337
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,760
This is the signal that's going to change the color on the LED.

338
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,260
So keep that in mind.

339
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,380
Hopefully that made sense.

340
00:12:59,620 --> 00:12:59,760
All right.

341
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,200
So this area here is very important

342
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,820
because this area has to do with your video transmitter

343
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,320
if you gave it power from the video transmitter part.

344
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,640
Because this is where the transistor

345
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,040
that's in charge of your video transmitter is.

346
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,860
Now, whether you can choose the video transmitter always on

347
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,200
or you can choose pit mode,

348
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,280
which means you could assign a switch on your controller

349
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,860
in order to give power to the video transmitter.

350
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,300
So you can do it both ways.

351
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,960
Now, if you're really not experienced,

352
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,500
just bridge the left two together

353
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,340
and you won't have a headache.

354
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,380
Overall layout seems to be pretty good.

355
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,120
I've seen better.

356
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,420
But, you know, I wish they've gotten away,

357
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,420
just, you know, removed these here

358
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,540
from their latest design before going into production.

359
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,000
Because this doesn't feel very professional.

360
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,680
Unlike their ESCs, their ESCs are really great.

361
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,080
Hopefully their flight controller is good.

362
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I still haven't used one of their flight controllers yet,

363
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,140
if I remember correctly.

364
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,640
This might be the first one.

365
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,200
Not sure yet.

366
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,460
I still have a bunch of builds to go fly and test,

367
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
which I haven't still tested.

368
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,700
So, yeah.

369
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,080
Everything here is linked down below.

370
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,920
Let me know what you guys think down in the comment section

371
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,080
if anyone's used any of these.

372
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,180
And I'll see you in the next one.

373
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:16,220
Thank you.
