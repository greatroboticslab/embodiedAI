1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,440
So, I finally did it. After stating in a video from 2017 that I would finish a DIY drone by 2022,

2
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,000
I am happy to say that I was finally able to put together this drone. Which can in fact fly but

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,240
I am still a beginner when it comes to controlling it. Now you probably already noticed that this is

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:39,520
not your standard drone like for example DJI mostly makes them which fly rather slow and controlled

5
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:48,000
so that you can make beautiful recordings. No, this is an FPV or first person view drone meaning

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,680
you can not only see what the drone sees while flying but it also moves way faster through the

7
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,080
air and thus lets you capture some unique video footage with the help of a GoPro on top.

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,680
And the reason why I built this was that months ago I got a beginners FPV drone kit that came with a tiny

9
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,520
drone which works wonderfully but can easily get blown away by the wind. So, I wanted something a

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,920
bit bigger and heavier and I feel like I went overboard here but you will see that later.

11
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,800
Before that though let me show you my journey of building this thing which was not super easy to

12
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,560
do because the drone market just overflows with different hardware, communication protocols and

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,000
software. But luckily after this video you should have a good idea of what is going on and you should

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,560
be able to build something similar. So, let's get started!

15
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,280
This video is sponsored by Keysight who have a huge virtual event coming up called Keysight World Innovate.

16
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,080
It is 4 days long and during that time industry leaders and experts will share their vision of future

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:16,720
technology which involves 5G and 6G, electric and autonomous vehicle advances, quantum technology

18
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,640
and much much more. If that sounds interesting to you then check out the link in the video description.

19
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,800
Let's start off by exploring what parts we need for drone and let's use my completed one as an example.

20
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,360
The first obvious part is of course a frame onto which all other components get mounted on.

21
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Next are the motors with propellers that create the upward thrust while spinning and of course we also

22
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:52,480
need a battery to power it all. Then some kind of receiver that like the name implies receives a signal

23
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,760
from a remote so that the drone knows what direction to follow. And since we are dealing with an FPV drone,

24
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,920
we also need a camera and a VTX system with fitting antenna of which I honestly also never heard of before.

25
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,800
It stands for Video Transmitter and it basically takes the camera video signal and sends it out as

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,520
a 5.8GHz signal that the FPV goggles which we also need can then receive and play back.

27
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,640
And the last things they are missing are the VC board and ESC board.

28
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,480
Now FC stands for Flight Controller and it is basically the heart of the system.

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:39,760
It for example comes with an accelerometer IC which the drone uses to find out how it is positioned in

30
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,640
the air and through the help of an integrated PID control loop it can then tell each motor how fast

31
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,360
to spin so that it can stand upright in the air without crashing. Of course it also manages to receive

32
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,720
controller signal, camera signal, outputs the VTX signal and much much more.

33
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:06,880
The only big thing it cannot do directly is driving the BLDC motors for which we got the ESC board

34
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,680
aka electronic speed controller board that drives the motors at a specific speed depending on how the

35
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,560
flight controller demands it. And those were all in all the basic components required for an FPV drone

36
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:28,000
and I started my component hunt by firstly looking for a frame. The reason is that depending on whether

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,360
you choose a small or big frame all the other components have to be smaller or bigger too.

38
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,480
And honestly speaking I didn't feel like buying a pre-made frame because when 3D printing a frame

39
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:47,680
you can always easily replace parts and by using PETG filament you also get reasonably strong parts

40
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,480
which eventually though can also break. So I searched for suitable models on printables

41
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:02,480
and eventually found this 6 inch one whose design I really liked. I asked his creator whether I can

42
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:09,520
showcase it in the video and he agreed and even helped me a lot during the build so big thanks to him.

43
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,240
And with the model selected I started 3D printing all parts

44
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,680
and while that was going on I was looking for motors on Amazon which the model trader actually advised me

45
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,960
not to use. The reason is that they often come with low quality bearings so he instead recommended this

46
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:37,120
motor in combination with a 4S battery. With the given kV rating using a 4S battery should give me an

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:47,440
average RPM of 37,814 which is above the RPM thrust graph I created in a previous video and thus it should

48
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,040
easily lift 500g meaning 4 of them should be able to do 2kg which I thought was more than enough.

49
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,400
And by the way I would highly recommend checking out the video I just mentioned because it shows you

50
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,240
very well how battery, ESC, motor and propeller interplay with one another.

51
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:16,720
But anyway the datasheet of the motor also stated that even with only 50% thrust it is capable of

52
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:26,800
lifting 563g so I was pretty sure that those should work. Next for the propellers I was advised to get 6 inch

53
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:36,480
ones but once I saw how close they get to the drone maybe turning it into drone goulash I instead went with generic 5 inch ones.

54
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:46,320
For the battery like I said before I went with a 4S one with a capacity of 2.2Ah and most importantly a

55
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:54,000
high C rating which basically says that it can output a high current and thus a high power which is more than

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,600
enough to enjoy the maximum power of all 4 motors. Moving on, next was the receiver and remote part

57
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,040
and for that I wanted to reuse the remote from my beginners drone kit. Luckily it apparently comes

58
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:17,520
with the ELRS communication protocol that can be used for modern drones. As a comparison back in the old

59
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,880
days all your drone remote inputs would alter one data channel at the receiver which is basically a standard

60
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:32,400
servo signal. But since dealing with so many data channels is just confusing, modern remotes and

61
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,800
receivers just talk to the flight controller through a receive and transmit line and thus we reduced for

62
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,320
example 9 data wires to just 2. The bad news is though that there are a ton of different protocols from different

63
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:55,600
manufacturers but like I said ELRS is apparently not only supported by my remote but also new and great

64
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:01,760
and I could easily get a fitting 2.4GHz ELSR receiver for pretty cheap from the internet.

65
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:10,400
So next I also wanted to reuse my old goggles which was also not a problem because all 5.8GHz

66
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,400
transmitter systems should work with them so I simply got one that was currently available.

67
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,640
And the camera was also a suggestion from the model trader which I didn't regret.

68
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Ok last but not least a flight controller and ESC and here I was told that pretty much anything would work

69
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,680
as long as the ESC could handle the motor current, the flight controller comes with a standard size

70
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,720
device and it uses Betaflight which is the software on the flight controller that basically handles everything

71
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:53,760
and that probably most drone owners use. So I decided on this Zeus 60A one because it looked well made

72
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,880
and came with a decent manual. And thus I finally got all the parts for the drone and if you want to

73
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,160
build something similar you can of course find a complete parts list with example seller in the

74
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,040
video description. There you can of course also find the additional parts like screws, standoffs,

75
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,560
zip ties and everything else. And with that being said I started the actual drone build by firstly securing

76
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,800
all the motors to the motor arms and then attaching those to the bottom piece of the frame with more screws.

77
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,280
At this point I was happy to find out that the motor wires were long enough to reach the ESC.

78
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,600
So I tied them to the arms with the help of zip ties before soldering the XT60 battery connector to the ESC

79
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:50,720
along with all the motor wires. Next I soldered the camera wires, receiver wires and VTX wires to the solder pads

80
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:58,400
of the flight controller like its manual told me to do so. And after connecting the ESC and FC with the

81
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:04,000
help of the given wire it was already time for the first power test with my lab bench power supply

82
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,160
which as you can hear and also see was a big success for me since nothing blew up.

83
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,760
And best of all the camera system already worked without configuring anything which was pretty neat.

84
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,800
What I still had to do though was binding the receiver with my controller and that was more or less a

85
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
nightmare because no matter what I tried my remote didn't want it to do that.

86
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:39,360
Eventually I found out that my remote is the FR Sky version which does not support ELRS and thus I had to

87
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,200
get a new one which does support that but it was certainly not new. The story continues though because

88
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,200
the binding with the bind button still didn't function. I actually had to not only flash a

89
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,880
new firmware onto the remote but also a new firmware onto the receiver which was not hard to do but finding

90
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:08,160
that out just took me way too long. And thus the remote and receiver finally bound correctly and it was

91
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,560
time for me to assemble the rest of the frame to find out how I had to modify it so that it can hold my

92
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:23,120
camera, GoPro mount and VTX antenna. The model creator also helped me a bit with that and since he uploaded

93
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,200
the step files of his model I had no problem adjusting a couple of holes and cutouts as well

94
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,760
and printing some parts again. And that means it was finally time to permanently mount the FC

95
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,720
and ESC to the frame, secure the camera with small screws on the front as well as the antenna mount in

96
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,120
the back, add standoffs all around the frame, use zip ties to keep all the wiring under control,

97
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,920
attach the GoPro mount to the upper frame and finally attach that to the rest with the help of more screws.

98
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,600
And just like that the drone was mostly done.

99
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,640
And next I had to connect it to a computer and use the Betaflight configurator software to get all the

100
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:13,680
settings right. To do that I first delayed the quads onto a flat surface to calibrate the accelerometer

101
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,520
and afterwards I configured the receiver system, made sure that the board alignment was correct so that

102
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:28,800
in this software the drone moves exactly like it does in real life. I had to alter two controller channels

103
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,280
so that the quad moves with the controller inputs like you would expect it. I had to add modes to

104
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:42,960
for example arm the quad and enter angle modes which is easier to fly and ultimately I checked the motor

105
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,800
settings and spun up the motors to find out that they in fact all spun in the correct direction.

106
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,680
And if you want more information about all of the Betaflight settings then I would highly recommend

107
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,640
checking out the Joshua Boutwell channel who made a video series about this.

108
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:08,400
But anyway with the configuration complete I added the propellers to the motors while making sure which

109
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:15,360
ones are the clockwise and counter clockwise ones. And after then charging up the battery and securing it

110
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,320
to the frame with velcro strips it was finally time for the first proper test in my hands to see whether

111
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,560
the drone would follow the directions I pointed to with the controller which it did just fine.

112
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:36,880
So I did a proper flying test next which wasn't as bad as I thought it would be but I should get used

113
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:44,080
to disarm the drone to get it to land. And the last test I then did in the garden was with the GoPro on top

114
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:56,560
which during the first run worked surprisingly well but during the second attempt the system oscillated

115
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:03,520
a bit and got out of control. I think this is a good time to mention that I am using the standard PID

116
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:11,600
values for my drone here which do work but are not perfect. So next I wanted to do a bigger test on

117
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,920
an empty field which clearly showed me that I will have to practice quite a lot to get any decent

118
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,640
results with my drone and worst of all as I was getting more comfortable with it it just stopped

119
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:33,840
its motors at the highest point yet and crashed to the ground. Needless to say I had to replace a couple

120
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:42,000
of 3D printed parts and I am not sure why the system abruptly stopped working. Maybe because I was only

121
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:50,160
using half of the original copper wire or maybe because I forgot adding the ESC capacitor. Whatever

122
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:57,120
it was this problem did not occur again after fixing those things and I was actually getting a bit more

123
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:06,000
comfortable the second time on the fields. I got so confident that I finally tried out flying with

124
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,640
the goggles on which made things easier and on top was an incredible experience. And with that being said

125
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:20,800
you should now have a basic idea of how to make your own drone and always keep in mind that you can

126
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:27,040
easily downgrade component parameters to not only save money but also make your drone lighter and

127
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:34,160
less powerful because truth be told my one is a bit too big and powerful for my taste.

128
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,840
But anyway if you enjoyed this video and maybe my other ones then consider supporting me through Patreon.
