[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:13.680] All right here is a mock-up of an H-Bridge motor control. It is an improved version of one that I
[00:00:13.680 → 00:00:22.920] published nearly a decade ago. I'll discuss briefly what the improvements are and while I'm just using
[00:00:22.920 → 00:00:46.860] a set of tactile switches that is a 24 volt I think 3 amp motor on 24 volts and I'm controlling it with a pair of little low-power tactile switches.
[00:00:46.860 → 00:00:56.760] All right here's my schematic for the H-Bridge I demonstrated at the beginning of the video.
[00:00:56.760 → 00:01:07.380] Here's just the two little tactile switches. I have four MOSFETs, four resistors, and two Zener diodes. This
[00:01:07.380 → 00:01:21.200] has been tested to operate as is from 5 to 24 volts. U1 and U3 are P-channel MOSFETs I used at IRF4905.
[00:01:21.200 → 00:01:34.440] U2 and U4 are IRFC44N. These are sensitive gate MOSFETs unlike my original design that used some lower quality
[00:01:34.440 → 00:01:42.240] P-channel transistors that used to get hot. I ran that motor at a couple of amps and I didn't even heat
[00:01:42.240 → 00:01:48.300] sync the transistors. So this is going to be a starting point. By the way the 6.2 volt Zener's
[00:01:48.300 → 00:01:56.400] are to protect the gate circuit of U1 and U3 because I'm using more than 20 volts.
[00:01:57.860 → 00:02:02.460] All right and so this will be the basis of several more circuits that are up and coming.
