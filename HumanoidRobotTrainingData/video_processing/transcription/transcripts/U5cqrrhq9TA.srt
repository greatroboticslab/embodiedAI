1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,560
This heat gun is pure perfection while this LED strip is straight up garbage.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,880
Wait, what? The reason why I am saying this is because when looking at the current consumption

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,540
of those two loads we can see a remarkable difference. First off the heat gun which draws

4
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:31,300
current exactly in phase with our mains voltage and its shape also almost looks like it aka

5
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:39,840
sinusoidal. Lovely. But next we got the terrible LED strip which draws current abruptly and

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,040
only for a short amount of time near the peak of our mains voltage.

7
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,300
Okay so what is the problem here? I mean both devices seem to work perfectly fine.

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,880
Well the problem is that the LED strip with its AC to DC power supply draws a lot of apparent

9
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:05,720
power from the power grid because of the weird current waveform while the real power it actually

10
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,980
requires to do its job of lighting up LEDs is rather small in comparison.

11
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,800
That is a huge problem because nowadays we got tons of AC to DC power supplies in our homes

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,940
and if they would all perform this bad then our power grids will have to face some big

13
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,500
challenges in the future. But it doesn't have to be this way and that is why such power factor

14
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:38,240
correction circuits or PFC for short do exist. And in this video I will show you what they can do,

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,680
how we can make them and why they are super important for our electrical future. Let's get started!

16
00:01:48,800 --> 00:02:00,080
This video is sponsored by Mauser Electronics who not only offer a huge selection of electronics

17
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,120
components but also development boards. And I am not talking about microcontroller boards or similar

18
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:14,400
even though they also have them. No, I am talking about development boards built around the newest ICs

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,880
and technologies which also includes functional PFCs that you will see later. If you are curious for more

20
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:27,600
then head over to Mauser Electronics or check the link in the video description.

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:37,600
Now let's start off with a popular analogy which is the foam to drink ratio. You see the liquid alone

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:45,280
represents our real power aka the power that actually gets used to light things up, heat things up or

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,400
for example charge your phone's battery. But as you can see that is not all in our glass which in total

24
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,280
represents our apparent power and that is the power your energy provider actually has to deal with in its grid

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,280
so that you can get your desired real power. No, we still got the foam which is our reactive power

26
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,840
and truth be told completely useless because it only oscillates between the energy provider and hooked up loads.

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,920
Due to it more current flows through the grid than what we actually need for the real power demand

28
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,600
and as you might know for bigger current flow we need thicker wires so that things do not get terribly

29
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:37,920
inefficient and hot and that of course costs lots of money. So keeping the reactive power close to zero

30
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,760
is our goal here meaning that apparent power should equal the real power. And in the heat gun example we

31
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:52,960
started with we can actually see such a behaviour that real power equals apparent power meaning it is

32
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,800
definitely possible. Which brings us to the question how such reactive power comes to be.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,320
The most popular examples for that are simply a motor and a capacitive power supply that you can

34
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:14,080
sometimes find in LED lights. Both of them create quite a bit of reactive power in comparison to their real power

35
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,640
power and the root of all evil for that is like I teased at the beginning their current flow.

36
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,640
The power supply ones leads in comparison to the mains voltage and the one from the motor lacks in comparison.

37
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,640
The reason for that are of course the electrical properties of the capacitor for the power supply

38
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,160
and the inductance for the motor coils. But feel free to watch my previous videos about those topics here

39
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,120
so that I can keep the rest of this video short and sweet. Because in a nutshell such phase shifts

40
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,480
do create reactive power. And the simple fix here is to add inductance to the capacitance and vice versa

41
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,680
capacitance to the inductance to get rid of the phase shifts and thus reduce the reactive power

42
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:11,440
and get a power factor of almost 1. By the way the power factor is simply the real power divided by the

43
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,400
apparent power and thus 1 means real power equals apparent power which is what we are after.

44
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,760
Now like I said one solution is adding capacitance or inductance to the power grid to decrease the

45
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:33,520
phase shifts and that is actually the first type of a power factor correction circuit and it is called a

46
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,560
passive one. Of course there is also an active one that I already presented to you at the start.

47
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,920
And to understand why we need it let's go back to the current draw of a common power supply I found in my shelf.

48
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,440
As you can see the more DC current I draw from its output the bigger the current pulse on the input

49
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,640
near the peak of the mains voltage gets. And by doing my usual measurements next we can see that this

50
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,760
current draw creates kind of a lot of reactive power which is easily noticeable through the low power factor.

51
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:18,480
But there is no phase shift so how does that work? Well the problem here is that this current waveform

52
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,200
can be depicted as a sum of lots of current waveforms with different frequencies.

53
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,920
Most importantly of course is the 50Hz fundamental frequency which is our mains voltage frequency and

54
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:42,640
it obviously does not feature a phase shift. But then there are also 150Hz, 250Hz, 350Hz and so on parts

55
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:50,800
which are called 3rd, 5th, 7th and so on current harmonics and they do kind of feature a phase shift

56
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:58,160
that creates the reactive power. By using my oscilloscope we can actually see how much they matter in comparison

57
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:05,280
to the fundamental 50Hz frequency and let's just say that they are pretty dominant on the screen here.

58
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,360
So what we can do to fix this problem is basically convert this small current pulse to an even sinusoidal

59
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,680
one. And like I said before a circuit that can do that is an active PFC for which I looked for on Mauser

60
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,880
electronics and I found a promising looking IC that only requires a few external components to function.

61
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:36,720
But before creating a whole PCB for it which requires lots of time I firstly wanted to do some

62
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,640
initial tests with a similar IC for which Mauser luckily offered a development board.

63
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:49,760
After powering its low voltage side with my lab bench power supply I next prepared a proper mains

64
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:56,560
voltage wire for it and this break might be a good opportunity to state that working with all the

65
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,600
mains voltage shown in this video can be dangerous and you should only do that if you are professional.

66
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:11,680
Okay with that out of the way I plugged the circuit into mains voltage and was very happy to find out

67
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:20,800
that nothing exploded. On its output I measured a voltage of around 400VDC which means the circuit works correctly.

68
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:27,520
And before I start explaining here why this high voltage and how it is made and what not,

69
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,560
let's rather keep it practical and crack open the power supply that came with the horrible current draw.

70
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,360
After removing its full bridge rectifier, I simply connected the output of the PFC

71
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,880
to the input of the power supply and by once again plugging in mains voltage nothing blew up and the

72
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,760
power supply seems to work correctly as well. This time though the input current does follow the mains

73
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,720
voltage shape a lot more when drawing more current on the outputs. That not only means that the current

74
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,920
harmonics are mostly gone but also that the reactive power of the system decreased while the power factor

75
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:18,000
increased. Awesome! I think you can see the difference with and without a PFC pretty clearly in this chart here.

76
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
Which now brings us to the question how such an active PFC pulls this off?

77
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,720
Well in a nutshell it does so by increasing the changing mains input voltage into a constant higher

78
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:39,520
DC voltage voltage that the power supply then uses. Because yes, an active PFC is basically just a glorified

79
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:47,520
boost converter. You see the problem of normal AC to DC power supplies is that they only draw current near

80
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:54,000
the voltage peak of the mains voltage because that is when the utilized capacitor's voltage drops beneath

81
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,320
the input voltage and thus can get charged up again. But by supplying a constant boosted voltage this problem

82
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,920
basically disappears. Of course creating such a stable boosted DC voltage from a varying input voltage

83
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:17,200
is not that easy because you need to monitor the input and output voltage as well as the flowing current

84
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,920
current and then turn on or off the boost converter MOSFET switch accordingly so that always the right

85
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:31,520
amount of energy gets transferred to the output. When having a look at our practical example then the MOSFET

86
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:38,560
switching pattern looks something like this with a bigger duty cycle at low input voltages and a smaller

87
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:47,120
duty cycle at higher input voltages which corresponds with the theory. So all in all such active PFC

88
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,880
are pretty awesome. And considering that there are already regulations in place that limit the created current

89
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:02,960
harmonics from appliances they will sooner or later become mandatory. So if you are shopping for a new beefy power supply

90
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,200
maybe next time consider getting one with a built in PFC. With that being said I hope you enjoyed this video
