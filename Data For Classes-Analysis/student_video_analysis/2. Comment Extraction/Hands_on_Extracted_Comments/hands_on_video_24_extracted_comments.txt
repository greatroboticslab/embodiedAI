I want to thank you for making these videos.

on point

Genial¡¡¡¡

Amazing!

Hey sir , you are the best trainer I founded. Thanks. And off course you deserve a lot off coffe. Thanks

What if I wanted to drill dozens of holes, each perpendicular to points on a sphere? Would I need to define a user frame for each hole so that it could know the plunge vector for each hole?

Sorry, I'm confused. You created frame 6, but you jogged in frame 4?

thank you for the video, how to setup  tooluser  frame?

Pls uplod more video you'r teaching method is very good

thanks you for your share. i had followed yet.

Thanks for the good video. But in the end it was put in 4th coordinate system instead of 6.But since the coordinates are similair , it works. Am i right?

Glad you like them!

yes

Thank you!

Glad you like it!

glad it helps

Sorry, no time to answer this question. It is not an easy problem.

Sorry, no time to look into this. If I made a mistake, it is obvious, and you probably know how to correct it.

No idea

The frames 6 and 4 are actually the same. I defined one of these frames before the video is being recorded.

Why do you write this?

Someone else should do that

Unfortunately, I cannot make that video since I am not at RIT anymore and I do not have access to FANUC robots...

Unfortunately, I am not at RIT anymore. I changed my career path.

@aleksandarhaber  pls send to your mobile No  i want to talk you i am from india

@aleksandarhaber Aleksandar, may I please ask you for tips on going into industrial robotics programming? I’d like to know what websites/resources you’d recommend for job searching. I’d also like to know which Fanuc/ABB certification courses you recommend— if any!

@cocacowboy21  FANUC has a certification program I think. However, double-check. I used to work at RIT and RIT has a very good industrial robotics program, where students actually have a chance to work with real industrial robots. Other than that, I do not know. Sorry about that.

Thank you!

The frames 4 and 6 are actually the same. I defined the frame 4 before recording the video.

No it wasn't... the tutorial taught the 6th frame... at the end you selected 4. It was VERY lucky your class used the same object to teach for Frame 4.

I caught that. He said frame 4, but never took it out of frame 6. I believe he just mis-spoke.

@timryder4036  The frames 4 and 6 are actually the same. I defined the frame 4 before recording the video.

@robertczekierda9930   The frames 4 and 6 are actually the same. I defined the frame 4 before recording the video.
