The majority carrier region is where electrons are moving, while the minority carrier region is where holes are moving. The conduction band is where both electrons and holes can move. The valence band is where electrons are bound to atoms and cannot move. The diagram shows the energy levels of each region and the difference between them. The energy levels of the majority carrier and minority carrier regions are the same, but the energy levels of the conduction band and valence band are different. The diagram also shows the energy difference between the conduction band and the valence band, which is 1.1 eV. This means that electrons in the conduction band have a higher energy level than electrons in the valence band."
