00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Hey everybody, Kenneth Russell here. I hope you're doing great today. Today I'm talking about cables,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,520
how to understand cables and their connectors. Check it out.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,360
Well, if you're a musician or working in sound in any way, you're going to come across cables

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:25,680
and all different types of cables. And sometimes it can be kind of daunting if you're just getting

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,900
into it because there's all these different connectors. You don't know what they're called.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,560
So let's talk about the connectors in the first half of this video. And then we're going to talk

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:39,300
about the cable itself in the second half of the video. By the way, a huge shout out to Hosea Cables

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,320
for sending me all these cables. And they're just awesome cables. I've been buying Hosea Cables for

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,540
years. If you're looking to buy an instrument cable for your guitar or microphone or whatever kind of

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:55,540
cable you're looking for, don't look any further than Hosea. They really are awesome cables. They

11
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:00,800
have different levels, good, better, best, and they're all very good actually. So let's talk

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,160
about connectors. The first connector I want to talk about is the quarter inch connector.

13
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:12,080
This would be also called an instrument cable or a guitar cable. Quarter inch, instrument,

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,660
guitar cable. These are all synonymous with each other. So if someone says, hey, hand me that guitar

15
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,240
cable or hand me that instrument cable. This is what they're talking about.

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,860
So the quarter inch cable just has two ends like this usually. And this is the male connector.

17
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:32,000
They're both male connectors. And we'll talk about that in a second. But they basically just one goes

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,540
in your guitar, one goes in your pedal board or amp. There's a bunch of different applications for

19
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,960
quarter inch cables. So this is what the quarter inch connector looks like. Now there is a male end and

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:52,240
the female end to just about any cable really. And this is the male end. And I'll let you decide

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,480
why it's called the male end. I'm not going to go into that, but let me see. Where was the

22
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:03,480
other one I was looking at? Oh, and then this is the female end there. And it's just basically

23
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:10,040
the male end goes into the female end. And so, you know, on your guitar, that's what this is going to be.

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:16,280
This is the female quarter inch connector or the jack. A lot of times people just say jack. If it's

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,960
attached to something, it's usually called a jack. Then you just plug it in like that. So in theory,

26
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,100
I could have the end of this cable could be a female connector and I could keep on connecting them

27
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:32,860
and just making a big long chain. So this is the quarter inch connectors, the male and female

28
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:39,540
quarter inch connectors. The next kind of cable is the XLR cable. And that is this right here.

29
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:48,120
Now, XLR technically is just the designation for the cable end itself. But usually when someone says

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,820
XLR cable, they're meaning give me a microphone cable or an audio cable with these connectors at

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,220
the end of it. So you can see here, this also has two ends to it. This is the female end because it's

32
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,180
got three holes there. And this is the male end. It's got three stems there and they connect together.

33
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,960
And you can make audio cables like this. Microphone cables connect together and loop like that,

34
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,900
which there's no purpose in that other than storing it maybe. But you can connect them,

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,820
daisy chaining them. And then on the back of your speaker or whatever, it's going to have one of these

36
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,500
ends that's going to plug into or your microphone. There's a lot of different uses for this on a mixing

37
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:36,220
desk. Most of the inputs are going to be XLR. If it's a pro mixing desk, sometimes you'll have quarter

38
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:42,180
inch on the mixing desk as well. Usually those are your main connectors. Also, XLR cables can be

39
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:48,280
data cables used for DMX lights. And we'll talk about that in just a minute. Right now, we're going

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,060
to talk about just the connectors themselves. The next connector that is not known as much on the lower

41
00:03:53,060 --> 00:04:00,420
end stuff, but a lot higher end pro audio gear has speak on connectors. And this is a speak on

42
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,120
connector right there. And this is, I think these are both the male ends right here. Now you'll see

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:13,680
sometimes that there'll be a female end. This is what the female end looks like. And they click in

44
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,420
like that. Now the great thing about speak on connectors is they lock into place until you pull

45
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,700
this back and you undo it. So basically they just go in like this, you twist them, it locks into place,

46
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:32,360
and then you've got a very, very secure cable until you pull this back. So these are speak on connectors.

47
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,520
If you can use them for your speakers, these are great because you're not going to have anybody

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,820
tripping over a cable and it unplugs. So if you're a DJ, maybe you're a mobile church setting up in a

49
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,660
school where people are walking around a lot, it's not a permanent situation. If you have the choice for

50
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,240
speak on, they're, they're very, very good. A lot of times too, you'll hear the word new tricks.

51
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,020
Someone will say, Hey, give me a new tricks cable or that new tricks connector. It actually isn't a

52
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,780
new tricks cable or new tricks connector. New tricks is a brand name. So it's kind of like Kleenex.

53
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,960
So, you know, if someone says, give me a Kleenex, they really, they're just saying, give me a tissue,

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,940
but Kleenex is synonymous with that. So sometimes if someone says, give me a new tricks connector,

55
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:23,000
they really mean speak on. And a lot of times you'll have a quarter inch to speak on adapter used as

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,280
well. If your speaker cabinet only has speak on connectors, but you only have quarter inch cables,

57
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,740
the next kind of connector we're going to talk about is the RCA cable. Now this one has a lot

58
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,360
of different applications that you will see, not just in pro audio, but in home audio as well.

59
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,200
And this is what the, the RCA connector looks like there. And you know, you'll see this a lot of times

60
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:52,700
the back of like a stereo system. There's just a lot of applications. The, the consumer world has

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:59,840
really embraced the RCA connector. But it's also has a lot of purposes in pro audio and in sound.

62
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,340
For example, a lot of times if you're doing anything stereo, if you're coming from a computer

63
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:10,920
and you're hooking up into a mixing desk, a lot of times they'll have from your computer to a,

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,940
like one cable coming out of that, which we'll talk about in a second.

65
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:19,540
And then it's making a Y connection to the mixing desk left and right. A lot of times the other end

66
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,860
of these will say, we'll have like a red and a yellow. These are also used in video as well.

67
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,920
They're, they're pretty cool cable because they'll transmit a lot of different types of information,

68
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,900
but this is the, the RCA connector right here. So the connector itself is called RCA.

69
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:42,420
The next connector is a 3.5 millimeter connector or a eighth inch sometimes is what it's called.

70
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,020
It actually 3.5 is, is more accurate, but let me open this up here. You're probably very familiar

71
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,340
with this because this is the kind of connector that's going to be on your phone. So if you're,

72
00:06:53,340 --> 00:07:00,440
you're plugging this in from an iPod or an iPhone into something else, this is going to be the connector.

73
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,720
So that, that little jack that's on everybody's phone, that is a, a 3.5 millimeter jack. Now I'm going to

74
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,920
actually grab my headphones here. This is actually the headphones to my phone right here. And you can

75
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,720
see on this one, there's actually three white lines there. That's because this has a microphone hooked up

76
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,760
into this. There's actually three different signals happening left, right, and then the microphone.

77
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,520
Usually though, in the, the pro audio world, you're going to see this connector right here, which is,

78
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:37,400
it's got two lines here. This is a stereo connector, which means there's a left and a right. So this,

79
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,520
this has a stereo connector. Now this is the same type of thing. You're going to see a male in like

80
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,880
this and a female in. Also, before I move on too far, this is a quarter inch cable with a stereo

81
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,960
connector there, a left and right. So this actually has two cables in here, two signals going through

82
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,280
this cable as well. And we'll talk about that a little bit more in a second. The next cable we're

83
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:07,560
going to talk about is MIDI. This is a MIDI cable here, and it's got two different ends like this

84
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,240
that have five pins. They look similar to an XLR, but they have five pins. This is a data cable. It's

85
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:24,440
going to transmit, uh, ones and zeros from a keyboard or an effects pedal, or there's a lot of applications.

86
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:32,040
This is definitely a pro audio cable here. So a lot of times in the back of, of, uh, of keyboards,

87
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,560
you'll see MIDI. Um, a lot of times keyboards are kind of moving away from MIDI and they're going to USB.

88
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,800
So a lot of your older keyboards are going to see MIDI instead of the USB. If you're hooking it up

89
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,440
like to a computer to record or something like that. So this is a MIDI cable and it produces or

90
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,960
transmits data. So now that we've talked about the different types of connectors in cables, let's talk

91
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,800
about the cable itself. So for example, let me compare a few different cables that I might have.

92
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:08,200
This is a guitar cable and this is a speaker cable. Both of these have quarter inch jacks here,

93
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:14,200
but they're made for two different reasons. Obviously this guitar cable, this generally when someone says

94
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,560
quarter inch cable, they're talking about an instrument cable. They're talking about this. This is for

95
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:27,880
instrument purposes, but this thicker cable here is for speaker purposes. Now here's the thing with this.

96
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,400
Sometimes you can take a instrument cable and hook it up to a speaker and it'll work, but

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:39,560
instrument cables are not made for speakers. Instrument cables are not rated. They're not made for

98
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,280
sending loud to a loud speaker spending, sending the audio to a loud speaker. So even though sometimes if

99
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:52,840
you hook up this cable to a speaker, it'll work, it's not going to be as good as audio and I think

100
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,800
that you might be able to damage your equipment if it's kept on for a long, long time. If you're just

101
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,320
testing something out, it'll be just fine. But if you're carrying a load on this, this cable is

102
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,800
probably going to get kind of hot and I just wouldn't do it. Now the other way around, if you take a

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,400
speaker cable and try to use this for guitar, it's not going to do anything bad and it's not going to do

104
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:18,520
anything good either. It's not going to be able to transfer the signal. It literally just won't go

105
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,520
through. So anyway, sometimes you'll see these two different connectors used for two different

106
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:33,240
purposes. So how do you know if it's a connector or not? Like this one here, this one looks just like

107
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,080
an instrument cable, but it's not. It's a speaker cable. So how do you know on the cable itself,

108
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,280
see if you can read that there. It'll say speaker cable. And this one says speaker gauge,

109
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
speaker cable, 16 gauge. And so on these, on the instrument cable, it's going to say

110
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,760
either instrument or guitar cable. I don't know if you can see that there or not, but it'll say

111
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:03,080
guitar cable on there. So, or instrument cable. So that's how you know. So whenever you, you,

112
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,520
if you have a lot of cables, you might want to just label them. That's what I do. A lot of times,

113
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll just put a piece of tape on the end of it and I'll just put GTR or SPK or something like that.

114
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,480
So I know if that's a speaker cable or if it is in fact a instrument cable. The next kind of connector

115
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:31,400
is XLR. And these three can all be used for speaker. You can use a, a, a speak on XLR or quarter inch

116
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,440
cable. And here's the thing. There's really not much of a difference between these cables. If you're

117
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,680
hooking them up to a speaker, you're pretty much going to get the same audio. Matter of fact,

118
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,960
a speak on cable and a quarter inch cable, these are the same cables with just different connectors

119
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:54,600
at the end. Now the XLR cable is a balanced cable, but it's not really going to make a difference in

120
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,680
the sound that you have. If you have a buzz in your system, perhaps you might want to try to use

121
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,200
an XLR instead of another cable. But generally speaking, XLR, quarter inch, speak on,

122
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,840
they're all going to work really well for speakers, but they're three different connectors.

123
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:15,160
Just depending on the manufacturer, they may want to use only quarter inch or only XLR or only speak on.

124
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:22,040
A lot of, a lot of backs of speaker cabinets have all three of them on it. So just it's the same basic

125
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,960
thing. People ask sometimes, are you going to get a lesser quality audio if you use a adapter,

126
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:35,000
like one of these going from a quarter inch to the speak on? No, you're not. All that the speak on is

127
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,480
doing is just making that really secure connection. Now over time, probably it's going to wear better,

128
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,880
the speak on connector is, than a quarter inch connector, but it's going to give you the same

129
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,720
sound. Same thing with if you're converting anything. If you're, if you're having like,

130
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,160
going from an eighth inch to a quarter inch, it's the same sound. It's just the connector

131
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,000
transmitting the signal. If it's a quality connector, then it's going to have good sound coming to it.

132
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,880
Now let's talk about XLR cables, both data and audio cables. Okay. So if it's a longer XLR audio cable,

133
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,120
usually it's going to be labeled like this one, it says microphone cable. Sometimes you'll see them

134
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,360
where they're labeled, uh, just XLR or they'll just say audio cable. Let's see this one here.

135
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:29,080
This one just says balanced, uh, interconnected. This one is shorter. It says it's a five foot cable.

136
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,480
It's a, it's just says audio. And the reason why that is, is because a five foot cable is not going

137
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,480
to be very good for a microphone because you can't hold it for very long. You can't even stand and sing

138
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,240
with it. So XLR cables are the connectors, but one is data and one is microphone. What does that mean?

139
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,840
These have different homages. Basically they're going to produce different frequencies. And so

140
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,720
they're going to transmit frequencies better for the different applications. So a lot of times you can

141
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:05,800
actually take a XLR microphone cable and plug it into a DMX light, which is going to be a, it's

142
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:13,880
transmitting data, uh, ones and zeros digital signal, and it'll actually transmit it, but it won't do it

143
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:20,600
well, and it's going to have some interference and it's not going to be as reliable as a DMX cable.

144
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Basically the DMX cable is better at transmitting the digital information. So unless you're just in

145
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,160
an absolute pinch, use a data cable to transmit DMX signals and don't use a microphone cable.

146
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:41,800
Here's the thing, data cables, the DMX cable will not go the other way around. You cannot use a DMX cable

147
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,880
for a microphone or any sort of audio. It just simply is incapable of transmitting that information.

148
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,280
It's not made for that. It's a digital cable. It's not an analog cable for those purposes. So you can try

149
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,640
to hook it up. It's just, you're never going to get sound out of it. It does, you can use the, the, the

150
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,520
microphone cable for digital, even though it's not recommended, but it will not go the other way around.

151
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:10,280
So therefore what I do is I always label my DMX cables. I just put a piece of tape on it and I

152
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,320
write DMX on it just so that there's no way in the pinch. You know, the thing is whenever you need a

153
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,880
new cable, you don't always have a lot of time. So you're just like grabbing a cable and you're trying

154
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:25,560
to hook it up. So I always make sure that it's super, super obvious of DMX cables so that I don't

155
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,160
accidentally grab the wrong one. Now, if you ever have any questions with it, it'll say on here, let's see,

156
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:41,160
this one says DMX cable, 24 gauge, 120 ohm. If you look here, let me see if it'll focus on that.

157
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:50,760
So it'll say DMX cable on the cable itself and on a microphone cable. It will either have nothing,

158
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:57,000
which is usually they have it now though, because DMX is so popular or it'll say a microphone cable,

159
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,600
or it might even say audio cable or instrument cable. But usually it says microphone if it is a

160
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,400
microphone cable. So you want to make sure that it does say audio or microphone on the XLR if you're

161
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,920
using it for an audio purpose. So with cables, as you can see, it's actually not super complicated.

162
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:17,240
There's only really a handful of connectors. There's more connectors out there, but these are the ones

163
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,600
that you're going to encounter most. If you're working in sound or you're working in as a musician,

164
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,320
you're going to see these connectors all the time. It's important that as a musician, you're familiar

165
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,880
with these because it's kind of the language that everyone is speaking. This is the information that

166
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:37,000
you're going to need to know as a musician. And so hopefully this was helpful to you. If it was,

167
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,240
please hit the thumbs up button, subscribe to my YouTube channel. If you didn't like this video,

168
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,480
just go ahead and hit the thumbs down button. I won't be offended. I am kind of surprised you stuck

169
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,960
around this long just to hit the thumbs down. But if you did, it's all good. Okay.

170
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,040
I make videos that help make musicians better musicians. So hopefully this helped you.

171
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,320
Anyway, Kinnis Russell out and I'll see you in another video.
