1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,720
Hey, what's happening guys?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:11,600
We're going to start another new series today, and this time it will be on filters.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,540
And today's filter will be the low pass filter.

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,680
So what's a low pass filter?

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
It's very simple.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,560
It's a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than the set point of the

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
filter.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
And how do we find that?

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:41,340
Well, our formula for the cutoff frequency is 1 over 2 pi tau.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,660
Or 1 over 2 pi RC.

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,580
So what's that tell you?

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:01:01,680
That tells you that this is a resistor capacitor filter.

13
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:12,680
We'll be using the RC time constant to determine our filter.

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,780
So the next question is how do we set it up?

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,120
Well, it's pretty simple.

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:30,720
We start with a resistor.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,880
And then we have our V out.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Then we have our capacitor going to ground.

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,980
And here we have V in.

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:58,080
So we bring in our signal here.

21
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,080
It passes through the filter here.

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,080
And comes out like that.

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,180
Pretty simple, right?

24
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:18,180
This particular RC filter is called a first order.

25
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,280
low pass filter filter.

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
How does it work?

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,780
Well, it works like this.

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:33,520
At low frequencies, so the frequencies that will pass, there is plenty of time for our

29
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,320
capacitor to charge up almost to the input voltage.

30
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:47,380
So the frequency we get in is very close to the frequency we get out with a slight phase shift.

31
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:55,040
Now at higher frequencies, because we're oscillating faster, there's not enough time for this capacitor

32
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,980
to charge up to the input frequency or the input voltage.

33
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,120
And what we get out is severely attenuated.

34
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,420
Let's take a look at building one of these practically on a breadboard.

35
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,080
Alright, let's take a look at the setup.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,720
So we have our function generator over here putting out a hundred kilohertz sine wave, ten

37
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,760
volts, peak to peak.

38
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,800
And then we have our low pass filter set up here.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,900
Let me zoom in a bit.

40
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,360
So our signal comes in on this white wire, feeds through our resistance, this is just

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:46,460
a decade resistance box, and at the moment it is set on 1K.

42
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:53,220
The signal then goes into this capacitor, which is a 1 nano.

43
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,360
And at the divider point we're taking our output signal.

44
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,980
So let's go now and take a look on the scope.

45
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,900
Oh, I've got things blinking off here everywhere.

46
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,120
Alright, let me get a good picture here for you guys.

47
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,800
Alright, so here we have our input signal, channel 1.

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,420
This is coming directly off the function generator.

49
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:28,680
And you can see we are at 2 volts per division.

50
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:38,080
Let's see, we're at 9.84 volts peak to peak, 50% duty cycle, blah, blah, blah.

51
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,800
Now, let's bring in channel 2.

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,220
Now if we take a look here, you see channel 2 also at 2 volts per division.

53
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,100
It's just slightly attenuated there and slightly shifted out of phase.

54
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:04,320
But watch what happens as we increase the frequency to our attenuation point, which in this case

55
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,120
is about 160 kilohertz.

56
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
We're at 100 now.

57
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,040
Let's go up to 200.

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Boom.

59
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,380
Now that signal is seriously attenuated by the low pass filter.

60
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,140
And if we go higher, 300, 400, 500.

61
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,560
You see as the frequency increases, less and less is passed of the signal.

62
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Alright, let me zoom back out.

63
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
We're going to go back down to 100.

64
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,960
Let's see if I can get this in the frame.

65
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,640
Now, I'll just turn down here a little bit.

66
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
And focus.

67
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:52,360
So, what we're going to do now is we're going to take off our 1K and we're going to go to

68
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,120
10K.

69
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:10,000
So now we have a 10K and a 1 nano, which remember our formulas, is going to make a serious difference.

70
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,640
So look at that.

71
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,880
There we are at 100 kilohertz.

72
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:22,280
10K at 1 nano almost completely attenuates that signal at 1 kilohertz.

73
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:32,600
And let's go down at 50 kilohertz.

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,820
You can see we're only slightly, oh I'm sorry, that's 10 kilohertz.

75
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,160
We're only slightly attenuated.

76
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,280
20, 30, 40.

77
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,660
Alright, let's go back.

78
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,320
We're at 10 kilohertz now.

79
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:59,160
And this time, instead of changing the resistor, we will change the capacitor.

80
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,160
And as soon as I find out what to do with my capacitors, here we go.

81
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,040
We'll swap out our capacitor.

82
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:20,040
We'll swap out our capacitor.

83
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:24,360
It's in the right spot, no.

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,920
Got to get them right.

85
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Or they don't work.

86
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Shocking, I know.

87
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Okay.

88
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:46,300
So now instead of 1 nano, I think this is like a 22 nano, it has almost completely attenuated

89
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,820
the signal.

90
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:57,980
So if we go down, there we are at 1 kilohertz.

91
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:00,700
The signal is still attenuated.

92
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:04,220
Let's take it down even more.

93
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,660
500 hertz.

94
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,260
I'm sorry, 100 hertz.

95
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:20,060
There's 200.

96
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,740
So you can see the effect changing the capacitance and the resistance has.

97
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,780
So let's go back up here.

98
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,400
And we'll take out our 1k, or 10k rather.

99
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,660
And if we put our 1k back in, boom, look at that.

100
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,980
Almost no attenuation at all.

101
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,740
200 hertz, 300 hertz, 400, 500, 600.

102
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:57,280
Okay, so somewhere around 500, 600, we start getting a slight bit of attenuation.

103
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,120
And that's the way you design a low pass filter.

104
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,580
So that is just about it.

105
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,300
If you keep one thing in mind when you're thinking about filters and RC circuits, and that is

106
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:20,040
a capacitor, whether it's, you know, one of these guys, or one of these guys, or whatever,

107
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,620
is not an on and off device.

108
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,940
A capacitor operates analog.

109
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,120
It operates in between the two extremes of on and off.

110
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,500
So there's that time going on there.

111
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,780
There's time to charge, and there's time to discharge.

112
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,660
And we take advantage of that to creating filters.

113
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,380
All right?

114
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,420
Next time, high pass filters.

115
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
Hope you guys enjoyed this.

116
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,120

I'm out.

120
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Peace.

121
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:02,100
On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree.
