i just have a doibt, can we train a ,machine learning model both with image data and video data same time?Nice work. My brother is also in robotics.

Comment! Still watching your amazing vids even years later!! 😂

W          .

can I use the MG 996R that rotates 180 degrees, or does it have to be 360?

Hello, I checked your page and I would like to understand how you calculated the max load of 1kg for the arm

My first video for this so please SAY WHAT YOU THINK OF MY COMENT

i can't find the library on the library manager of arduino IDE, help pls?

glove circuit diagram link bro

Where can i get

i want the bill of materials

What bearing want؟

can I use sg90s?

buh

like this comment and ill subscribe

Thats a cool robot arm i know theorical physics so i can already imagine what its like to make my own after all Einstein was also a theorical physicist and he said himself that imagination is more important than knowledge.

I see in the instructions that M3x63 screws are used.  Where can I find this screw

Damn ........... Good work ........... Keep It UP

gonna be honest im planning on making a hulk buster suit n yk... i want it to be massive n somewhat like whats in the movie so like i understand how the fingers would work but im having issues with the elbow n shoulder joints, if youve got any tips on where to start id be grateful

Hi, I don’t think maximum degrees of it really matters. I also have questions with servos type. can I use MG995 to replace MG996R? Does it use the same library as MG996R or how do I change it? Thanks!

sad

Enthusiasm is good even on an old video like this one! 😊

worked bro? if still stuck I can help

@nandeesh7886  hello i am stuck can you help me please.

Hello!

How did you rotate the base😊

Heyy. great work! Please did you solder the flex sensor with the jumper wire?

At 20:00 The third line bro is showing his address 💀

What is the total price of the components?...can you please answer

Your voice is to nice ❤❤❤

Thanks for sharing your project. Recently, I am also making a robotic arm of my own. I am very lucky to see your video, which is very detailed and patiently explained, and the sound is very relaxing.

How heavy is this complete assembly?

What are the diameters of the screws used and also the hole diameter of the modification done to the part where the led was fit?

bro i need exactly this kind of thing for my project im studying in IIT i need ur help making this please can u give me ur number or g mail or any other to contact u i kindly request

please help, where do I find the bearings and screws !! you can't just leave out so many details like this man :(

Great job! Have you tried programming a FK or IK for the robot? (Forward and Inverse Kinematic tasks)?

Yeah it's really good but bro PLEASE put more support on joints next time the claw was basically attached to an aluminum straw so if you were any less lucky the whole servo motor could have broken that had me shook every time I saw it move my man

oh wow. I'm late to this party.

Great video! Just discovered your channel, it's amazing. I just wanted to ask if you had some advice on how to learn Arduino programmming lenguage, i can do the basics but i want to improve and be able to understand and write a code like that.

how do you control the arm without the glove?

Bro chill i was just joking

comment

good evening where do I find the materials

Can you provide zip file of HCPCA9685 Library... fasst.. Before 6 jan Reply me if you can..so I can wait

Hi, Can VR Quest realtime communicate to control your Robot remotely?

hi can i know how to pair the bluetooth module. I have final year project and need help

Wow this is absolutely amazing

Where can we find the liBRARY

comment

i am currently working on fruit plucking robotic arm so can yu help me like what kind of camera i can use for getting the distance of the fruit and also how can i convert that coordinates into robotic arm movements

can the robotic arm move ?

I don‘t usually comment on YouTube videos but I just needed to give you a shoutout for this. Awesome fucking job man, thank you so much for sharing this!🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼

Excellent

Very cool

CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME THE DIMENSIONS OF THIS ROBOTIC ARM FOR 3D PRINTING AND ALSO TELL ME HOW MUCH WEIGHT THAT THIS ROBOTIC ARM CAN LIFT

can i make the arm with esp32?

I watched 5 seconds of your video and subscribed

Amazingly simple. Genius presentation and work

this dude is crazy

I think I am going to try and modify this concept to be a backpack with two arms, perhaps an option to detach and roll away so it can be used remotely.

<comment>

Did you get it to work

What screws did you use

Do you think this would work to stack objects?

Awesome man but what platform your using

hi what is the optional for lipo battery? doing my final year project

Sir how can I get the dimensions for the robotic arm?

The screws described in the Thingiverse website does not seem to match with the hole sizes in real life. Please give some insights on the screws used for this robotic arm.

Robot really told a robot that he's not a robot, and the robot believed

Dude, not only you got a new subscriber, but a fan! Thank you so much, I really was struggling with a project and your explanation really helped!

Hey, this is so awesome, just one question,  How and where are you using the potentiometer, and for what purpose? I am confused.

Can I get a block diagram of the components and how they are connected and how they work for better understanding

How can i install the library? I am unable to use the code because of the library!

You are such good man , in every aspect

Make 2 so you can make a remote controlled C R A B

very cool great job!

Thank you so much for posting this. I wimped out and bought a black metal arm kit from amazon for $80 but it came with no instructions to assemble it and no base or code. Luckily I found your video and I had no idea how much more I could do with it. Just ordered my flex censors and they were like $2 a piece. How can a hobby this cool be so cheap to participate in?

woow cool need to learn too about arduino where should i start from

comment

this is amazing. I am in my third year of engineering and I need to write my dissertation this year. This would make for an interesting project.

Eben please share the measurement of all component so that i can take 3 D print out . without knowing the size its not possible to build.

Cost?

This is phenomenal man. Thank you so much for explaining how everything works!! Absolutely loved that.

Bro are using only 5 servo motor and 6th servo motor is replaced by stepper motor am I right or wrong

How to make parts of robot

Is the battery optional

I don't have a 3d printer hiw can i make this

Can I get a wired controller version please, lol, I ain't a fan of wireless tbh

The video was made of huge effort.  Video editing takes time.  I liked the way you represented the video steps.  Thanks for sharing.

Are there any libraries to download?

I suddenly had this idea that I wanted to build a robot arm but didn't have a clue where to start. This video has given me the base knowledge I need to make the next steps. Thanks!

Please reply anyone Please this is my final year project Please help me guy who know detail about this project Please

If anyway here done make this robot please share your coding to me

I doing this for my school project i spend alot money but still now it's can't move please reply sent correct code in your website the coding was error help me please

All codes error hope you send me correct  code and Everthing please this project important for me now please help

Help me i need ur reply please sent all coding because i can't run the coding until today i start doing this project last month until today i can't get solutions

I still working build this project but i can't run the coding all can you help me please

Hey can I turn the robotic arm left and right using hand glove or hand gestures ? Please answer 😊

How much did it cost?

Where did you learn to do this sort of thing?

Comment

This is so awesome!

did you do it?

Bro how much kg filament you use for printing whole Robotic arm not exact in kg but around how much kg required to print whole Robot arm

Could you please add info on the bearings used? Thank you.

me and a friend are trying to make this but the servo test code is not working even though everything is wired correctly

can it scoop ice cream

hey is the link has all the robotic arm parts or there is missing pieces left?

how expensive does this get?

hello sir can u pls send the 3d model of the hand glove i rlly to this content it is very different that others thank you have a great day

The new Black Panther actor 😂

🎉🎉✌🏻️✌🏻️✌🏻️👍👍👍✨️👍✨️

So you literally reply to every single comment?  Could you tell me a little bit about your personal passion with robotics and what drives you to do what you do?

Hello. I have a question about servos. Recently I have made a rover with a 5DOF robot arm. I used standard brushed servos (2x 80kg and 2x 30kg and 1x 13kg). 4 of them work as intended. However, the 30kg one in the claw (DS3230 Pro) keeps overheating. I have already replaced servos in the claw several times, because they burned due to overheating. During operation, the claw servo becomes really hot. Even when not holding anything in the claw, after 10min it becomes hot. I am thinking about replacing it with something better that will enable my rover to hold objects for several minutes, and the servos won't die. But what is better?  1. Brushed servo with full aluminium case. Maybe will dissipate heat better. Cost approx. 22$ 2. Brushless servo with partially aluminium case. Brushless motor, theoretically, will dissipate heat better due to its windings fixed to its case. Cost approx 26$. 3. Very weak brushed servo (just enough to operate the claw). Lower power->lower heat emission->longer time before overheat. Cost under 10$. 4. If all of the above are bad variants, I will make a custom worm gear servo (that won't consume power when static). But then I'll have to redesign and re-print the claw. Cost under 10$.  Which of these, do you think, will solve my problem?  Coreless servos are not considered, as they are even less resistant to overheat than cored or brushless.

This is amazing content. Thank you for contributing this.

Hello sir, Can you provide the 3d print model of the arm used in this video. I've made the electronic part of the robot, but unfortunately the print I got was using a servo motor. My stepper motor is jot fitting with the 3d Model

What is the total cost of this

don't print in full infill or else you will fucked up, shit can't move

Hey, link in the description. Also a full blog tutorials including links to the .STL files of the robotic arm parts. Good luck!

@EbenKouao  Thanks for replying and btw does connecting flex sensor with the arduino need soldering iron?

@EbenKouao  Hey how many accelerometer and flex sensor are needed fot this project? BTW this project is awesome!!!!!

Hey! I still try to (was back with least back with 100 subs… good problem to have)   Sure, got a passion for Robotics (mainly all engineering spaces). Currently I’m working on a last mile delivery robot with detachable accessories. Making it multi functional, attach a Arm or a delivery compartment to the robot base etc. (more on the smartbuilds Insta)   What drives me? Pushing what human mind can do: The ability to manipulate electrons in a specific way to make a motor induce movement to mimic human gesture in order to complete tasks is the closest thing to magic imo. This knowledge helps solves real world problems that way.  By day, I’m a blockchain developer.   Lots of engineering content coming soon to the channel. Stay tuned! 🔔

Cool video bro

can i get the files so that i can make one ? for educational purpose this is my project in my school

Don't try this project. I literally trusted this video blindly and almost ended up in mess. The circuit diagrams provided has some mistakes and pairing two bluetooth modules together is a hell of task. Also the code provided has a lot of error. In my case, I had my father to sort all this out and he saved me in an extent. Don't try this for science fair or project work. Those who comment without trying this and praise him are second generation humans who work like the flex sensors, I bought "" Useless/invalid""

im so ready to give this a try

Hello, the work is nice, did I cant see the IK did you use it?

Just wondering what screws are you using?

Can I use a stepper motor at the elbow joint to lift load?

One of the coolest robotic arms I’ve ever seen!!  Just wondering if you’ve made any progress on Mark 2??

please?

how did you use this driver for this servo (the servo current at load is 2.5 A and the current per channel for the driver is 25mA) i tried it it doesn't work :(

Could you make a more detailed video showing every step of the assembly and every step of the circuitry as soon as possible?

Awesome

Hi Bro, why is your arm robot still a little bit delay after received the control signal? Could you have solution for this?

Bro the stepper motor is not given in the description it would be nice if you add it

Nice job guys

arm kit detail

Bro how to connect two blutooth modual  eachother

Hi  I'm jayan

is it engineering and technology

bro please send me this video program insert method

This project isn’t an easy project but a rewarding one that teaches you a list of fundamentals from connecting motors to the likes of paring a Bluetooth module as you mentioned you achieved.  I don’t think it’s nice calling people that. Especially as others have built their own models and variations.  The project is fully open source, as you mentioned you were able to sort it out too.  It would great if you can contribute your fixes/ corrections to the GitHub open source repo so others can also learn from as opposed to mentioning errors without any context to what you’re referring too. This would be appreciated. Thanks.

@EbenKouao  Moral of Github project : Give money get finished...

RAVIRAM PLEASE HELP, TELL ME WHAT U DID TO MAKE IT WORK, please man u would save my life i am prepared to pay you

Inverse kinematics

Mark 2 dropping ~ 1 month. This is going to be full open source. Have a look at @smartbuilds on insta for dev updates. New features, integrates with droiid Robot and stronger motors/ torque now using the NEMA stepper motors, and more!   We’ll be experimenting with AI ;)

@EbenKouao how’s it going??

Did you figure it out

@deemaalsahely1762  it didn't work with this driver we used 12 V,10 A power supply connected to a printed pcb has a mounted fuse for each servo with max current of 2.5 A to prevent damage to the servo

@kareemmohamed4341 did the whole project work?

The "wrist" servo is not alligned. Use a Multiplex servo tester and set it to "1500".  I already have 1 robot arm, but I'm currently buying parts (stepper motors, drivers etc.) to build my own.

Can I use only stepper motors instead of servos?

Needed help in making this project

What apps did you use on your phone to control the Robot Arm to connect with the Bluetooth ?

hi Eben i come from China. I learned your code. but i can't understand some function. Can i talk to you ？

Hello sir could you please tell what code languages need to learn to bulit robotics like this? Thank you sir.

where do you get the hcpca9685 libraries because its not showing up on my Arduino ide

Perfect opportunity to call it Dum-E

koment

Hi! how heavy is this system and how much can it lift weight wise? whats the tolerance

Maybe you can program it to this  stuff

WOWWWWW

amazing one,so helpful and so underrated my friend i hope the better for u and keep going on

can the accelometer be used even for the elbow joint and arm?

cant wait for mark 2.00

I’m making this for my school science fair 👍🏼 (8th grade)

Can I use MG955 for this project? I just have them at home and I don't want to order MG966 if it's not necessary

Comment

is there a list for Bearings, screws, and Ball Bearings?

did you use PLA for 3D printing?

and i have reproduced most of your project.but i can't understand the meaning of some function code of mpu 6050

ardunio c++

Did you figure it out

Yep! , you’ll need to programmatically map it to the desired motor

Good luck!

Yep, although looking into Resin prints in the future

What executed did you use? Can I use a random executer?

Would you sell these robotic arms if need be . I'm interested in buying your technology

I am a professional developer who has never dealt with such things.  I don't know anything about electronics and 3d printer.  I see a lot of little gadgets on the Internet that are very attractive.  However, it is not at all clear to me whether it will be difficult, and whether it is possible, to make a more powerful and most importantly practical thing by a professional software  developer?  Cherries grow in my yard.  Is it possible to make a device that would assemble it for such a character as me?  Or does it all remain at such a level as to raise a tape and put it nearby and nothing more powerful?  Thank you in advance. Sorry for the stupid question and thank you in advance.

Can anyone recommend a robotic arm to start with. Budget around 100-200

This is Greatness our six year old sun/son love these things. He wants to make them himself. Very inspirational and thanks for sharing bro!!✨👌🏾🌍💪🏾

finally a machine video that dosent have 1000 pepole spamming terminator

Nice. Gonna try to make with dad. But with our own code.

Hey Eben I just made the arm and the glove but nothing seems to work. Any suggestions?

Great work. I  don't have a 3d printer now so my robotic arm will not look anything close to this but one day I will make it

Great work. Impressive!

If you did more videos I am sure your views would be through the roof. That is srsly cool stuff.

I downloaded the library and added it to the code but it is still saying "hcpca9685 not found" please help

Any tips for someone looking to get into robotics as a hobby ? Great Channel

whats the entire cost of parts

Man this is the best I have seen. Very impressive but I have a question What program do you use for programing the motors and movements?

hello, do you think that a 2000 mhA battery will make the servomotors work, also 4.8v? Cheers

Hi Eben, where are you find the glove?

This is really impressive

Can this project done by 4 dof

Comment reply comment

Hey Om, Great that you're working on this project!  I wod suggest breaking down the "nothing" into smaller tasks / wins. (Makes it easier to debug)  Are you able to get the motors spinning? If so, are you able two Bluetooth modules communicating with each other? If so, are you able to get one Bluetooth module to send data to move the motors?  Hopefully breaking these down into smaller tasks would help making the debugging easier.  Good luck!

@EbenKouao  I just checked everything, and I can't get the Bluetooth module to send data to the motors.

Arduino IDE / C++

Did you ever build it? Would love to know if it went well or bad thanks!

Very interesting. Bright fellow. Super deserving of my rare subscription  ... 🇬🇧

Thank you for this video ☺️

I am from India your this this video is helpful for me🥴

hey Elben love the video I just got one question are you able to send me the file of the part that you modified please?  cheers, blib

Hello Eben, finally I found what I wanted. You are the best Arduino YouTube tutor ever!! Thanks a lot.

Comment :P

Comment

I couldn't resist ... comment 🤣

Sir please make MARK 2 as I want this for my project 🙏

Great work! Keep making these great videos!!

When I run the file HCPCA9685.h: for the robotic arm, No such file or directory error showing up what do I do?

You need to put fingers on it

Repliied :)

@EbenKouao  Haha, thanks for this amazing video!

Great work bro I'm going to start building this one

Sibscrined fak why in the world i just found this

I just found you and you're so underrated, I gotta know how did you get started doing all this? Your editing and engineering skills are impeccable

Great video! Very interested in building similar projects but I'm not good at programming. Which language should I master to program micro controllers like Arduino?

This is great! I am not making a robotic arm but something similar. But I can’t seem to figure out how to copy my arm movements from 2 IMUs to servos. The translation movement not rotation.

Definitely making it!!

Can you give me the 3d parts dimensions and blue print please

GREAT JOB!!! THANKS

PLEASE HELP...where do the capacitors go. They are not in the diagram. Thank you

Where did you put the capacitors?

Hello I am trying to build this as well, do you know what screws and bearings are needed?

I was legit looking for this exact video thanks :)

I need help , in arm code there i a wakeup function , whicj initially wake the robot , but if i run upload the code commented wakeup() them why my but not doing anything even not responding to any input commands . I can see that the initial parking position is provided but it didn't work, robot just do nothing.

Really appreciate you are doing this much hard work BTW Are you making version 2  Some ideas I would like :- Voice control , dance thanks

@Eben Kouao In the performance part, why is the lipo battery and 5v battery pack not connected to the circuit?

You can add smooth library for more natural move on servos

I am a beginner in machine learning as well as robot arm and its programming, so what I am asking you is can you help me where and how to start from scratch for robot arm programming? I am also very interested more of programming the robot arm and other servos systems using music so I am here seeking your help.

Damn this is crazy cool

subcribed and notification on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! much love from kenya. I love how slowly and detailed you explain these

Thank you my brother for sharing your wisdom with us. You've inspired me to try this project.

Did you build it would live to hear if it went well or bad would be much appreciated!!!!

are you currently building this

@markodonnell8625  i haven’t done it yet but im planning to

@sebastiansosa2257  I just started on it

@markodonnell8625  have you got all the materials and if so what was the final cost

@sebastiansosa2257  assuming you have a 3D printer, it’s like $150, which is totally worth it. You could also find ways to make it cheaper

@sebastiansosa2257  I just have no clue where the capacitors go

@markodonnell8625 I do have a 3d printer and have you checked the article?

@sebastiansosa2257  yes but there aren’t capacitors on the GitHub diagram

@sebastiansosa2257  Yes, and the diagram doesn't show where they go

are you currently working on this?

Hi Paglet, got a Mark II coming later this year. Going to be also compatible with the Droii Robot. Stay tuned!

@EbenKouao  Hi Eben, any updates on the mark II? thank you!

Thanks Abdallah!

Which one is the master and which is the slave?

How do you run the code after pairing Bluetooth? Which arduino would you run the code to? What code can I use to run it after everything is built, you don’t have the final code that you used to run.

Can you please tell me the method you used to configure the master and slave bluetooth modules I tried so many methods but no vain

can you send code please I need it

Make this robot phone control

im thinking of printing the model slightly smaller so that the model can be a little lighter so that the motors can move a lot more easier, but that might entail problems like servo size etc. does it sound like a good idea???

Can you make a crochet making machine out of robotic arm?

I can’t find the original article, does anyone know where it is?

no more robots with servos please :)

Hi  Eben  Kouao  great  video  thank  you  for  sharing.      I  will b e  glad  if  you  could  help me  with  an answer:   I  do  have  a  large  industrial  robotic  arm  that  does  not  work.   Do  you  think  I  could replace  the  software  of  the  large  robotic  arm  with    the  software  and  control  hardware    you  ennumerate  in your  above  video?

Could u help?

hi Eben, my son wants to control this arm with mobile, and repeat the step to do work of pick and drop, can u help me with the code ??????????????????????

since nobody has tried this, I'm just gonna say out loud that my actual comment is COMMENT

can i do this with out 3d printing

okay, this guy is a genius!

very inspiring

i ask it is better use rotary encoder or linear Potentiometer or this accelerometer to control robot arm according to low budget ?

Making the robot solve the captcha... classic. That alone is enough to get me to instantly subscribe after I finish writing this comment.

sir i want the robotic arm movements for contineous working, can u hlep on this, code and how to custom programne it from out side to work according to the need

which pins do i put each servo on?

We're you able to fix this thinking about building would you recommend?

@Eben Kouao  can you help please

Did you figure this out???

Does sound like a good idea. Possibly a smaller servo would carry less torque / hold objects. Worth a try though.

That would be next level dexterity! ... currently best can do is move objects remotely. I would revisit this project though - see what we could improve.

Link in the description or visit smartbuilds io

I would say that industrial robots would be a lot more sophisticated and stronger motors than the DIY Robot Arm. You could replace the microprocessor and salvage the motor and robotic joints to make a newer version. Sound cool!

@EbenKouao  tkank  you  for  your  message  yes  I  do  agree  my  robotic  arm  is  a  german machine  that  was  working  under  Windows  98.  Do  you  think  the    maker  company  would  provide  upgrades  of  the  operating  system  from  older  windows  to modern ?

:)

:)

Question. What software or website did you use to create your Arduino circuit schematic?

Sir, can you make a video about the Arduino Bluetooth Robotic-arm tank and also give me the circuit diagram and the code for the Arduino Bluetooth Robotic-arm tank?

Sir, what courses do you learn to get into the robotics field? Sir, tell me, are you a mechanical engineer or electrical engineer, or mechatronics engineer? Sir, I want to become a robotics engineer, what do I study to get into robotic engineering?

The base is wobbling over the stepper gear. Doesn't this raise any problems?

How do I learn this programing from the basics  could please suggest me the route to robotics all the ardino stuff and its programing with my requirement

Hello , good job my friend , i was wondering if you can give me the measurements for the base and the arms , and the whole robot?

hey, i love this video and the project but i still cant understand how to connect the two bluetooth devices with eachother as master and slave, do you have anything to make it clearer?

That’s freakin pretty damn impressive and awesome. Question is it possible or can you do a video by using this method by build the a sentry airsoft gun, kinda like Thor Ragnarko where valkyrie was rescue Thor scene and I know not as a big but in table side like? If so that will be freakin awesome too

Hello, I have a 5-axis robotic arm, an arduino mega 2560 board, a bluetooth module and a gyro module(gy-521). I would like the handsets to constitute a single block of code that will allow me to control the arm from my smartphone. I am asking for your help with programming. Thanks

can it write some words?

I really want to make one of these

Fantastic! Thanks!

for a flex sensor the 10k resistor used is variable resistor or fixed resistor?

Randomly found this channel....and suscribed 😂 Great content keep going...😀😀

Hello I want to control the main axis of this arm with a potentiometer number, not with a hand movement There are two servo numbers at the bottom, one should be 180 and the other negative 180 But I did not see it in the uploaded code Can you help me how to control two servers with pca9685 driver ??? I want a code too But this code is not for 16 channel drive low1.write (posL); low2.write (180-posL); please help me

LOVE THIS PROJECT LOVE YOUR CHANNEL BRO KEEP UP THE GUD WORK SUBSCRIBED, LIKED, SHARED LOVED IT

Do you just need 1 flex sensor or do you need 2-3?

Ive been wanting to build a robot for the science fair next year when i go into 9th grade, to make a huge epic impression. i thought it would be cool to build one that was motion controlled, but didnt know how. this. this is the video to jumpstart my dreams. but i have one question. how much does all of this cost in total? im kinda scared for this

I am building this for my Projects and Engineering Class and I have a few questions and comments. When you use the rechargeable 5V Battery to power the arudino what is the amount of current running through there, bc I believe that my battery pack is tripped by the current and shut down because of that. Is there something you can recommend? Or what is the brand of the 5V Batttery pack you use for the arduino board? Also you have several parts missing within your list of necessary components for the robotic arm such as screws, the metal ring you use for support on the middle beam and ball bearings.

hey can you please do this using a myo armband and arduino.... please help me out with this

Fritzing

Hello did you figure out the bluetooth part

Thank you Seema!

@EbenKouao  keep explaining your projects and just keep the same quality of videos 😀 It won't take more time to hit a million subscribers 😀😀😀

2/3 would increase the amount of sensors mapped to  the Robotic Arm. But you could use 1.

Awesome, The main Costs would be the Motors./Flex Sensors You can get more details in the description, it may vary based on where you live.

How much did the servo motor cost you?

Dude, this video helps me a lot! Keep the work going man!

i cant find the arm code on the website ?

Imagine adding 4 of them at your back and you can littterally become a superhero

Good

Sir i would say that your videos are amazing but because of your thumbnails your videos views are decreasing so please concentrate on that....

Hi there is there any way I can buy all of the parts as a kit this would really help. Thx

Great Video!!  Does the base fully rotate (360 degrees)?

this channel deserves so many more subs. love you videos man can’t wait for more

BRUH I LOVE MARK CAN I MAKE ONEEEE

hey.... how to contact you..?  i had some doubts on this project..can you help me plz.....

This is brilliant. But is this consider an IoT product?

Thank you so much, last year I printed this and used it for my school project last year, but I modified it and used, joysticks instead of the hand glove, I’m watching this again to try to improve it

Great stuff I’m building a project for at work, this really opened my mind.

Hi Eben, I'm about to start this project but have two questions. What was the item at 12:37 on the back, was it a gear or something? Also, are there any exact instructions on how to assemble the robotic arm aswell as the required screws on the article i cant seem to find any.

I am planning to make this robotic arm for my project. I have visited smart built for code of this project but the page is unavailable and I couldn't find any codes, can you please suggest me how can i get the codes. Can you please mail me the codes or share link?

You ma boy just got an extra subscriber. Great content, have allot to watch.

Awesome . Just awesome Eben !!!! BEST robotic arm project I've ever seen ( for home builds) . excited to see what the 2nd version does/looks like. !!! I just realized something.. the Arm hands. the fingers and stuff.. couldn't that be made out of a "flex" type filament? or should be remain "stiff" ??

How can you lengthen the main arm part of it to cover a large chalkboard?

really good

That’s a really good advice

Currently the Arm isn't connected via Internet comms. But that's a good idea for a revision :).

@EbenKouao  Thank you, looking forward to see more amazing products from you :)

Awesome!

Hi there .... did you make it using Bluetooth also ?

You ever build it?

Hi Abdullah, you can find all links to 3D files and code on my Github. In description. Cheers

Are there any dimensions for the 3D printing parts?

is there a way to power all of the arduinos without the need to rely on a battery? or is there any sort of specific power supply that can be used to keep it powered from an outlet or something that will keep it consistantly on?

I’m building one of theses for my father, he has lost the strength in his fingers and can’t pick up a fork to feed himself or hold a cup to have a cup of tea. Giving him the glove will give him his independence back. This has wonderful possibilities

Okokokokokok

Is it possible to lose/lessen the delay with the arm movements?

Do you have the solid work designs or 3D printer designs for the manipulator or hand controller?

Hi, I was just wondering while I was trying to upload the code for the robotic arm it kept saying "H68CPCA95.h: no such file or directory". Why is that? I completely followed the steps too.

This is awesome. Just discovered your channel and I look forward to seeing what you work on! My son is really into the idea of making robots, so hopefully we can get some inspiration from you!

This is the best channel to explain each steps to do. This is exactly what i want to create the robot arms by using 3D printer and arduino products. Thanks.

Cool

great video! but why are you using a servo driver. Wouldn´t it be possible also without

I'm planning on making a robotic arm for agricultural implementation as my school project. Please can you assist in anyway?

I havent even watched more than 10 minutes and i can already tell you enjoy these projects. Like you have everything in the description and thats great, so thank you for making it as easy as possible to follow along

👍

Great video! Thanks

Hello bro, love from india!!!Can you develop a robotic arm which can pickup a soft material like fabric by using electro static adhesive technique.

Hanzhen harmonic drive gear,  robot arm gear ,  over 30 years experience,

I like your project. I am wondering if I do a project similar to your one. Could you help me. I can pay you through Paypal

can you make diy easy inmoov robot hand please(wireless) controller

I am doing a science project and I want it to have a robot so this is perfect and I will give you credit😁😁😁😁😁This video was AWESOME!!!

Wow, keep me posted

Sure, you can remove the code delays. You may also look into other communications too like RF as a alternative. Cheers

@EbenKouao  right, thanks mate 🍻

Hi Alexander, you can find all 3 parts to the file including the manipulator/ claw in the description below... also more details on the glove in the git repo

Hi Ali, you'll need to import the Motor Driver Library to the Arduino code. You can find the zip library to import in the blog equivalent in the description below. Good Luck!

​ @EbenKouao  ​  Thanks man code just worked, all i need now is to get the parts printed. I Will let you know if it works! Thanks! :)

Did it work?

Many thanks Todd!

Thanks! More projects on the Way!

Hope this helps :)

Did you ever build it how did it go? I would like to hear if it went bad and also if it went well. It would be appreciated!

Wow... Your videos are outstanding!! But I found something challenging. My robotic arm is not heavy because I'm using SG90's servo motor. I don't think your code would work for the sg90's beneath the robotic arm because you used a stepper motor and  also the steptepper motor is included on the code. Please can you send me the right code for complete 6 sg90 servo as you previously talked about in your first prototype. Needed it for my high school project. Thank for the time, seeking for your responses

Can I use acrylic sheet I find online? It has 4 servo

Sir can you please provide whole project circuit diagram with bluetooth circuit also plz plz

Supa! What about using wifi to increase control range and add camera and some lights on that claw

how come the robot arm and glove thingy arent included in the part list

hi i want to do this project but I just learn python and i don't think it's python yo used for yours so what should I do? I'm a little time constrained so I can't start learning a new language. i

but great video

boow of waah

british

Hello your website is died , i can't visit it

Hey! Amazing video kept it up. I tried to go to the website of where the code is in the description but when I clicked on the link it said “There has been a critical error on this website.” What do I do now?

nice video. do u also have the list of what type of screws use?

Would  you  do  a video  with it with a rmocontrol

Btw can you tell me why are these breadboard used for?

You got a sub broo

This video is amazing 🙏🏼 thank you for sharing this knowledge in such a clear and concise manner. Your work is appreciated and supported.

Awesome videos

Can you record the movement’s of the robot arm ?

You deserve far more attention! Keep up the great work :D

How much is it if i buy material it outside?

Pls, I need your reply?

You're one step ahead of me ;) . New Project dropping soon takes on this approach. Control a Robot from anywhere (via Twitch) Stay Tuned!

You can find more info on the part list in the description below. New Project dropping soon. Stay tuned!

m3 screws. You can find more details on the screws used in the Description (ThingyVerse). Good luck!

sounds like an idea ;)

Great for protoyping, quick electrical connections.

Much Appreciated Fahad!

@EbenKouao  Pls I need your reply? Check my comment🙏🙏🙏

Yes, you can track the position of the servo and repeat the values as a function

Hi, I looked at your website to download the robotic arm code and it says the page is not found. What should I do?

Thank you so much man

Bro how

Bro i need your help  It's show an error "HCPCA9685.h: No such file or directory" What should i do

Comment

hey i am building   my own robot eye and i want it to move are these servo motor good

Hello, can you please make this project public in tinkercad?

Hi Eben, I love your videos. Can I check on what books did you use to read and learn about arduino and raspberry pi? I would like to learn more as well. Would love to see the robot do some object detection!   I'm currently learning to use arduino and will try to pick up on raspberry pi as well. thanks for the videos!  Shoutout from Singapore! Stay awesome.

this is great thanks for the list of parts

Very awesome and easy to understand - Thanks!

Great job man. Keep going👊🏿👊🏿👊🏿

😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 coooooooooooool super coooooooool I have to build one

so dope! Would love to try it

You're amazing. Thank you for these videos. You've inspired me to start creating. Sincerely. Wow

This is good stuff!!!🔥🔥🔥 Quick question, what software did you use to detect the change in the flex sensor and accelerometer?

Hey this is amazing.I am building a robotic arm ri8 now and have some queries...can I get your mail/social media?

Do you have any suggestions for raspberry pi? Currently using that.

I have a 3D printer, the Ender 3, and a Long Mill CNC router. What I have found is they share the same code, just two different programs to generate GCODE. The nice thing is the Long Mill will cut Aluminum as well as wood. I made these postage stamp holders I designed for the ender 3. I can also make them on the CNC router in about 20 minutes versus 5 hours on the Ender 3. The price for a Long Mill is $1,500 ($2,000) out the door. The disadvantage of the Long Mill is you can only cut one side at a time. Which isn't bad for 90% of the things you are cutting. If you want to see my design and download the code go to myminifactory dot com and search for "Postage Stamp Holder" with no quotes. If you scroll down the page you can see the ones I made out of wood.

This will be my third comment because just the idea of me doing something like this because of how great the tutorial is. The idea of me controlling something so amazing. I'm so excited to try this.

I want to make big version and put it on wheels. Irl real steel.

hi

Arduino IDE

@EbenKouao  wow thanks! Is there a link I could use to learn how to use it or do you have a tutorial for that already?

Link, code, schematics and all in the descriptions. Good Luck!

Ever build it would like to hear if it went bad or good would be much appreciated!

@navysnow5618  unfortunately not YET. I’ve been lacking the funds but maybe i. The bear future

@Rveruq V Dohv  I found a better one that a lot of people made on thingverse I typed in robot arm and filter was most makes and it's the mk2 orange one. It is much cheaper to make than this one and has lots of people who added to it and things like that. I'm going to be making it after I build my pc in the near future.

The fact that you used tinkercad makes me respect you so freaking much

Would this and other videos this guy does be classed as electrical engineering? Or robotics?

comment

Nice I also built a robotic arm😃😂

We can use Nrf2401l? radio controller?

Good

Does anyone know what a total cost for this would be?

Comment

Such an impressive and interesting project. I’m a pre-graduate electrical-computer engineer and you really got me hyped to try something like this at the upcoming summer. If I have any kind of questions or problems could I contact you in any way? Again, amazing content!

Is there a way to map the value of the flex sensor to the servo motor position, rather than having the servo position just moving forward, backward, or not at all? Are you able to send the mapped value of the flex sensor via the HC-05 or are you limited to just a single character (ex. f or F)?

It's video so delightful! Thank you for your efforts. Everything is so clear.

comment

COOL

love the dunce cap from ironman

Thank you! I was trying to find a way to get into making robots and I think this is it!

you sound like phoenix from valorant

I came here back when you made the magic mirror and now I seen you made this very talented my guy, I’ve been really enjoying your content. Just out of interest where have you learned how to do all the stuff you do. Right now I’m studying computer engineering and I find college projects aren’t the most creative so it makes me wonder where people learn how to make these interesting projects

Love this project man! I'm a beginner myself but this is truely inspiring ! Can't wait for mkii! Also... "comment" :P

Excellent work.This code is not found--arduino_robotic_arm_code

Can you explain the gripper assembling part of 3d printed parts..?

Yess broo the Dp!

Mine was hydraulic powered

Full article in the description (Goes in detail) with links to the code :)

Repliied

Cheers, and that's sounds like an awesome course! Sure, Instagram link in description.

Hi Ethan, Good question. Possible with a bit of code: One way to do is to get the analog value readings from the flex sensor and map proportional to the movement of the motor. The only thing here is that it may be too accurate, so any spikes would need to be smooth out... possible to add a capacitor to smooth out the flex sensor values.  Let me know if you try this approach. As this would be the next evolution to improving the robotic arm. Cheers

Hi Kyle, much appreciated! Mostly, mixing project and adding new elements to it. More Bigger project on the way. Stay tuned!!

Repliied :)

Hi Patnaik, the repo link has been updated. Also the full documentation can be found on my site: smartbuilds. Good luck

You can find more details on smartbuilds (link in description)

Can you give us a tutorial one how the 3D design was made

bro u are so awsm ...can u make jarvis keyboard one like in iron man movie when tony says    :  are u there jarvis

comment

Hi again, I am getting down to the electronics and wondered if there is an alternative to the 11.1v LiPO battery. it seems to need a specific charger so could i use a 9v battery instead to save money? Thanks

the day I found pure gold... Epic bro, epic

i Got a pi related question and i think you may be able to help. Im trying to make a video looper with 2 monitors. I have a  PI4 b and was wondering if i could extend an image accross both displays, sort of like using hdmi 1 for half the image and  hdmi 2 showing the other half. Im not sure if this could be done in the setting of the looper or if id need to try OMXplayer or lastly a MST hub to split the image. I know a piwall setup my be my last option ,just trying to avoid buying 2 extra  Pi 4s for the job. Its 2  monitors  stacked ontop of each other to make one long narrow monitor. Any help will be much appreciated

What 3D printing app did you use

Hey man, great video! I had a question about the robotic glove electronics assembly. In your diagram I just see the parts you listed, the resistors, nano, and so on...but on your video I can see a few capacitors. What capacitors did you use, and do you have an updated tinkercad/multisim layout of the breadboard? Thanks for your time!

Keep up the good work man! Just bought my first arduino mega kit

Nice presentation, but more a music/promo video than a video that shows how it was done. Could work in some lounge setting though.

Half way through this great lockdown project for an old man. Finished the 3d printing and assembled the arm. Now I have learn about the software.Thank you for a well presented project and that stretches me - but not too much!! Best of luck.

How can I contact you?

Heyy amazing work. I recreated this. Only without a stepper motor and with only 1 flex sensor and your codes. It does not work. How do I have to change the code to make it work? Am a beginner. Please help

So glad I've found your channel. Thanks so much, keep it up man!!!

Love this project. Love all your videos

"Comment"

this is random but do you have the 3d printer files for the arm?

Awesome work 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Hi Eben. Congrats, I love your work. Please tell me, how much you spend to do something like this? Thank you.

Dude such a chilled cool tech video. U need to get more content out more regularly. Good shit 👍

You can have a look at the 3D print on ThingyVerse which would go into more detail on the screw, assembly instructions etc. (But open to looking into that :))

@EbenKouao  thank you so much my friend😊

Alexa powered Keyboard (with Pi inside it) - with a Wakeword of "Hey, Jarvis". Sounds interesting ;)

@EbenKouao  pls make it for me pls pls

Repliieed

Hi Trevor, you could also use a RC battery, they typically come with a charger .... hope this helps

TinkerCad

Thank you so much good video

Hi Matt, I used a 100nF capacitors to smooth out the signal. You can find more details on this in the article (in the description) Frizington diagrams and stl files. Good luck!

@EbenKouao  Pls I need your reply? Check my comment🙏🙏🙏

Cheers Ben, got an interesting one dropping soon stay tuned ;)

Hi Aaron, you can find the full article, diagram and code in the description below

Thanks Trevor, glad you found this project interesting. More projects on the way!

HOW LONG DID IT TAKE U 2 FINISH??

did you manage to do it? I am doing it and I have some questions

Didn't finish the glove bit but got distracted and tried to control it remotely using pots instead. . t have recently got back to it with a simpler 4 DOF robot using servos only. I will still keep playing as I learn a lot on the way. Keeps me young. P  s I think the software needs debugging as I could not get it to work.

Could you provide more info on what specifically i.e the code error?  You can find sample code for the flex sensor on the git repo too. Hope this helps.

Sure, links in the description to get the Thingverse stl files

The Motors where the most expensive Part.  $150 max on parts excluding the 3D printer.. but the best part is it can be easily upgraded. Good luck!

​@Eben Kouao hey, I just calculated the cost based on the links on your website. I got around 300usd why is it so high for me are you including glove 2 thanks!!!

You are awesome bro, i like it 😍

Great video learning alot from u🙏🏾

Man you do the coolest projects ever. Love this channel

Absolutley stunning, quick question : would it be possible to control the robot arm using a vr Handtracker( for example the camera Michael reeves used for his srugeon robotor), id love to see many more interesting projects from you

can you bild like a full hand? So you can controll a full hand, this would be so fookin cool

like sub bell and comment easy dude i like you

comment

Dude you're so underrated! You totally deserve more subscribers!

Nice to see an offspring of my gripper in the wild.

Make this arm autonomous using raspberry pi  and camera.

Make a personal assistant like Jarvis in iron man

Comment

What a great tutorial man, thank you so much!!!

Comment: Ammmmazing!

Comment

Hey I love this and it’s amazing have you considered using potentiometers to track your absolute position of rotation for control?

This is guy is an absolute genius

Build a tank that shoots nerf bullets, that sounds so fun!

How did you gain the knowledge to become an inventor and make stuff like this?

Found you from reddit. Awesome content, subscribed!

Yeah you can

Sky's the limit ;) ... better sensors would be a worth looking into

Ah man! Your channel is great, Subscribed. Do you plan on making more videos/projects?

@EbenKouao  Well I hope to, right now my day job and other stuff eating up my time budget. Last years I spend a lot of infrastructure work so not much progress on the robot front.

Like this Idea!  Why not put this on a rover too.(visiting this idea) ;)

Oo, not bad

Really ,make a personal assistant like alexa or Google home

Replieed!

Cheers, PBnnJ, Good idea...not for this project but building off this is definitely something to be used for a future project

Bro!

Haha, not bad!

Working on Arduino Project, gain a understanding...see how you can bring that ideas into another project. Rinse, repeat ;)

@EbenKouao  Oh okay thank you for the response I found it to be very helpful

Awesome!

Welcome back, m8! Nice project! I ll try to implement it, after I will finish testing the Bitdefender Box 2.

Defenetly underrated talent. You will make it big.

hey man quick math quesition and also this is awesome dude, this is better than the last 3-d printed arm i saw and it's functionally better, also you went through everything and showed it working1 thank you!!!! but quick math question, you say it can lift 2kg max but for the MGR when i google it, the Maximum Stall Torque is 11 kg/cm @ (6V) aren't we like spacing out our torque or whatever so it can't actually pick up that much? I figured like 400 grams to a KG but 2? maybe some of my other robots are stronger than i thought... 0.0 idk if i missed it but can you explain that please? Also YOU'RE AWESOME!

Keep up the great content !

Excellent project

I sat next to him in class

Amazing video!! Looking forward to more! :)

Hey can we make the arm with wood instead of the 3D printed material?

Don't miss 18:44

Only legends have been around since 13:37

🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Nice build...i am going to get this 3D printer working again.

"or you skipped to the end" that one got me lol... Great job man, definitely saving this particular one for my build

Nice video. Thanks for sharing.

great work, much insightful and very educative

Popularity bump👍

Whats the torque on the motors, and what is max weight it can lift?

Awesome, as always.

Waited sooooo long..... Finally! This is cooler than before..... Before you didn't 3d print the parts........ You are so cool man!

I LOVE THIS

Much appreciated Ion, more projects on the way!

Hi Greg, much appreciated, and thanks for the shout! You're right, this holds a comfortable weight of 600g. (Although It could theoretically hold up to 900g+)  Yeah, I wish. The 2kg isn't correct, this was based on an earlier motor specs.  I assume this was written in the article, I've corrected this now. Cheers!

@EbenKouao  honestly i'm not sure i've been on here, other videos of yours, and your website so idk. but okay 600g ahh makes sense that's still pretty awesome most of the arms you can buy for 700 or 800$ have about the same payload! this is friggin cool man! If you need stuff 3-d printed let me know! Altho i bet you have some of them too hah!

Cheers Greg, never a bad idea for extra prints. Thanks and stay tuned for future projects!

Cheers!

Loool, Chemistry GANG

Yep, that would look pretty nice... would need a bit of work though!

Hahaha

Ayy!

Hi MrBe,  the Servo used (MG996R) is rated for 12kg/cm. Max weight so far is ~600g (safely)  But can be increased with a stronger motor

Appreciated Hafiz, more on the way!

@EbenKouao It is me hafiz arif. I have a channel now..... It is because of you i made it. You gave me hope and courage to do it.... Well it is still new so I am not that good..... Thanks for the comment shout out! : )

don't reply to this comment.

Wow that is so cool you're quite talented

Man.... That's extremely awesommmmmee!!!!💜💥💥🔥 That's not fare at all you should have 1M subs.

One of the most underrated channels! Keep up the good work

Algo

Im new to your channel and just started getting into arduino tech. Everything is new to me but I would like to know more about the fundamentals. How did you get involved in this tech and what helped you understand the inner working of this versatile technology.  Thanks ol cheeky fella

Great project, what's the best book to get started with Arduino?

His voice is so relaxing 😌

18:45 need this tutorial next

Shiny!

Hey  man, been following your channel for a while now and love the content but just wondering where is a good foundation to start if I want to learn to code and make these projects like you, if it helps I study a level physics and maths.  Love your content

Welcome back Will.i.am ! I love your vids, I hope you and your channel keep growing.

Love your videos, we want more!!!!!

Love this! Can’t wait to attempt.

Okay

Cheers, more projects on the way!

He’s got 50k subs that’s not underrated

@PillowMonkeyVR  You do realize this comment was 3 years ago (It's a bit late to reply to him). 😂

@amerqanadilo5648  yeah hadn’t realised that my bad but tbh lots of people do this

;)

Hey Jesse,  I studied Computer Engineering... but it was most of my fundaments that really came from playing around with projects starting with getting an Arduino LED to blink and going on from there. Personally, trying to get the project to work forces you to get your fundamentals right.  Cheers, and Good luck on learning with an Arduino

Hi Lorenzo, There are a few, but I'll recommend having a look at the official arduino/inscrutables  / hackster blogs for example projects to make and build on top off.  This way you could have hands on approach building projects.

:)

Not bad looking either.

@EbenKouao  can I just say I thought the music was just slightly too loud though? Really great production otherwise.

He speaks soooo slow

Hi 🙋🏻‍♂️ is it posible to record movements and re play later ?

@EbenKouao  Pls I need your reply? Check my comment!!🙏🙏🙏

@EbenKouao  Bro, Mine is not working!! Why?

@EbenKouao  Does the flex sensor needs to be calculate then we correct it from your given tx code?

@EbenKouao   I just wanna know if this robot arm can only be controlled by the Robot Glove ?

@danielyakubu6828  You can control it with anything! You can think of the Robot Glove as the remote and the Arm the receiver.  The remote can be anything, a keyboard, software, AI ... we'll looking into some of these for Mark II ;)

​ @MAMorelli 🤨🏳️‍🌈?

Hey Sami, That's solid! Tbh, the best way that helped me is making mini-projects, building, and mixing projects to make newer projects. You'll be pushed/motivated to learn code if you want the project working. Probs, get an Arduino to blink an LED and go from there. (Also there's a lot of community support when learning)  Good luck!

@EbenKouao  thanks man, will deffo get started

Lool, more bigger projects on the way. Stay tuned! ;)

This is pretty neat

You're back! :D  Edit: Man. When this pandemic is over and I get access to my makerspace this is def. on the todo list!

Cheers, will look into improving this some time in the future... could be interesting!
