1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Music

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No! God, please no! No!

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It needs to attach a GPS to it. Like I'll find my drone.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Found it!

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That was far as fun.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That was far, right?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's why I was like, I can't hear it. Where is it?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I heard it that way.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It started going RX lost, which means that I'm about to fall out of the sky.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey guys, this is SupaFPV here, and today's video is all about this little gadget right here.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This little lifesaver.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And it is a GPS.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Essentially, it will do two things.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Show you where your drone is in relation to your start point.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And it can also have the function to bring back to your original location by flipping a switch on your controller.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So if you're interested, stick around.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And just before we start the video, consider subscribing if you want more content like this.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And if you guys have any other video ideas, please do comment down below and I'll try to work hard to make one of those ideas.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Or a few of those ideas or all of them.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this is the BN220 dual GPS GLONASS module by Bishin.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And who is this meant for?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is meant for those people who are flying relatively mid to long range.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Long range for sure.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You definitely want one of these things or something more expensive like a nicer one like the BN880.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:57,000
But for those of us like me who fly a relatively mid to half long range ish, definitely in areas like you saw in my video in the clip in the beginning where I was flying above the treetops and on top of a lake.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And everything kind of looked the same.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Even the landing areas look the same.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And all the trees look the same.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And the ridge line looked the same.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And I was just like, where am I?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What the crap is going on?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
A little history on that video.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was flying at the lake in Austin and I flew kind of far over the lake.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And then I was trying to come back and none of us in my group of seven could hear the drone to ascertain where on earth it was.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Was it to the right of us?

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Was it to the left of us?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We had no clue.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I eventually just landed in the middle of a field and split into two parties and we just went out and searched for it.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And again, as my friend said, you should you should put a GPS on it, like find my phone kind of thing.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And that's exactly what this does.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So if you're interested, again, stick around and I'll show you how to put together this onto your drone and set it all up.

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And again, this is meant for those people who fly relatively mid to long range.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And it's really nice to have definitely not a need to have if you're flying mid range, but definitely must have if you're flying long range.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Not necessarily if you're flying mid range, but if you're flying long range, you definitely want one of these or another variant of this if you want.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So the reason I chose the 220 over the 80 is because I don't need the additional functions of the 80 in the 220 will do just fine for my purposes.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So to give you a little size perspective and a little physical dimension perspective, this is it right next to a quarter.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's pretty dang small and you can probably squeeze this into any part of your drone, preferably on top of your drone.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We'll talk about that in a little bit.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So what exactly comes inside the box or a slash or bag of the the the GPS module?

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It comes with two cables, one with connectors like four separate connectors, and then one with an actual like solid connector with all the four wires connected into one one one pole.

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And it also comes with three M sticky double sided adhesive pad so you can put it on top of your drone or wherever you want on your drone.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's all you really need in the bag.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But I would have liked some sort of a manual to know which wires do which.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But I will explain that to you guys when we start putting it onto my drone.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
So how much does this GPS module go for this is the BN 220.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So the mid range one of the ones that the BUSH makes on Amazon currently it is 1489.

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
As of the time I'm making this video, I have it open up on my phone right now.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's 1489.

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It can go up.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've seen it go up to like 16 bucks on Banggood.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think you can get these for like 10 to 12 dollars if you want to wait the time to get it shipped to the United States or wherever you're living.

64
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And then the BN 880 I believe is like 17 to 18 bucks if you want the additional functionalities that come with that.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
And I would recommend that for like a long long range drone setup.

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So let's hop on over to the workbench and actually put this together.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And let me introduce you to what each of the wires do and where you should put it on your your drone and which pads you should put it on and everything.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Alrighty. Now that I'm on my workbench, the audio might not sound as clear because the mic is a little distant from me.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But I'm going to try my best to talk as loud as I can so the mic can pick up everything and you guys can get all the information that you need.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So, um, here we are with my five inch drone.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You guys have seen this before.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And let's talk about placement of the GPS.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Alright, so the GPS people like to put it all over the quad.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Um, and where I'm going to be putting it is right here, but with the GPS actually facing up.

75
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So on top of my actual quad, the bat, my batteries are usually about this big.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So, uh, I'm going to try to run a wire through that little hole around there and then mount it over here.

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But I've seen people do, uh, putting it on top of their GoPro mount.

78
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Uh, and I've seen people making 3D printed, uh, pieces so that they can mount the GPS to the back.

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And I've also seen people putting it on their arms.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Um, I think the arms should be the last option because, um, if the propeller decides to just bend a little bit in a crash and you pick it up.

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Or like you, uh, you turtle mode your, uh, your, your quad and then, um, fly back.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It could damage the GPS or cut the wiring and cause a short circuit.

83
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I would recommend not doing that.

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Uh, in my situation, I think it's best that I put it here because everything's really crammed inside the, uh, quad.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And you don't, you do not want it to the antenna to be, um, the antenna of the GPS to be, uh, uh, interfered, uh, by the carbon of the quad.

86
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So you don't really want to cram it inside because that'll, uh, that'll interfere with the signal coming from the satellites to the sensor right here.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Uh, so, uh, for my situation, again, I'm going to put it right there, try to run the wires through the, the top plate and, uh, hook it on into the quad.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Uh, but again, you could, uh, be fancy and 3d mount something, uh, or 3d print something over here, uh, or under here.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Uh, as long as then the satellites have like a no obstruction signal that can be, uh, reached to the, to the front of it.

90
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Again, people have done over on top of, on top of their GoPro mounts.

91
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
People have had like loose wires, so then they could put the battery on and then put the GPS on top, which I would not suggest

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
because in case of, uh, like the battery ripping out, you are in for a bad time.

93
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Uh, so that's that.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Uh, so again, I'm going to put it, be putting it right here.

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uh, I'm going to take off the entire, uh, uh, all my, uh, screws and then I'll be back, uh, with the zoomed in perspective.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So we can see what exactly we're doing on the flight controller.

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So we have everything all opened up, uh, and ready to go.

98
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
First off, I want to apologize for the focus.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I actually have it on manual focus and I believe it's in focus, but, uh, cause the, the auto focus kept, uh, screwing up on me.

100
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
And, uh, the table is kind of wobbly.

101
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So everything's kind of, kind of weird.

102
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Um, so I do want to apologize for, for any like quality issues.

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Uh, so, uh, we, uh, let's talk about the wires real quick.

104
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
We have a red wire.

105
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Uh, we have a green wire and then we have a white wire and a black wire.

106
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's talk about the red wire.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The red wire is your five volt power.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So you want to wire this to a five volt pad on your flight controller.

109
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have the white wire, which is your TX pad.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And, uh, in, you know, it's not going to go to a TX pad.

111
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's going to go to a TX pad.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's going to go to a RX pad.

113
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So the TX wire, which is a white wire goes to an RX pad.

114
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So then you have your black wire, which is the ground.

115
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it goes to a ground pad.

116
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And then you have your green wire, which is the RX wire and it goes to the TX pad.

117
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So let's talk about that again.

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
We have the red wire, which goes to the five volt white wire that goes to the RX pad because it is the TX wire.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The black wire goes to ground and the green wire goes to a TX pad because it's the RX wire.

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Uh, this wire is really long.

121
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
So I'm probably going to shorten it out, uh, for ease of, um, application.

122
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
And so I won't have any extra wire sticking out or anything.

123
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Um, so yeah, uh, let's talk about which pads I'm going to use and then we can get onto soldering.

124
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So this right here is a diagram of my flight controller as it is right now, as you can see all the, all the, uh,

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
ESC related stuff is right here and that's over there.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So we know we're in the proper orientation.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I have, uh, an open UART, uh, for TX5, RX5.

128
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
And I also have an open UART over here for TX2 and RX2.

129
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So I'm going to be using these TX2 and RX2 pads over here.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Uh, and I am currently using the five volt as you can see, uh, for something else.

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I'm going to use the five volt from down here and the ground from down here.

132
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Just so these two are close together.

133
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Rule of thumb.

134
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You always want an open UART when you, when you do this, you don't want to use a UART that's already full.

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
My, uh, my full UARTs are, uh, the Bluetooth UART.

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Cause I do have a Bluetooth on the F722S, uh, uh, flight controller.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Um, UART1 is for SBUS.

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Uh, I have UART3 taken up and UART5 is available.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And UART6 is for ESC telemetry.

140
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Uh, I'm going to be using UART3 or sorry, I'm going to be using UART2 since that is the one that's, uh, open for me and I have nothing, uh, on there.

141
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So these, this TX2 pad is right here, RX2 pad over here.

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And I'm going to using the ground pad, which is right here.

143
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And the five volt pad, which is right here.

144
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Um, again, I apologize if things are out of focus.

145
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Uh, hopefully it will, I can probably put it back in focus, uh, once we actually start soldering.

146
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So again, just to reiterate the wire diagram, I'm sorry if I'm repeating this too often, but it is very important that you wire it the right way, the correct way.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So again, this TX2 pad I'm using over here is going to be going to the green wire because the green wire is, uh, an RX wire.

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So the RX goes to the TX pad.

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Um, and then the next pad over here is the RX2 wire for UART2.

150
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Um, that I'm going to be putting the white wire there because the RX pad, uh, has the TX wire, which is the white wire.

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Uh, and then the red wire goes to five volt and the black wire goes to ground, just like for pretty much everything, uh, you've ever soldered onto a flight controller.

152
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The red is always five volt. Well, not always, but usually it is. And in this case it is, um, the red is five volt and the black is ground.

153
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So I'm going to cut everything up and, uh, get to soldering. Um, and I'll do a quick montage of that and I'll see you after it's done.

154
00:11:47,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So there you have it. I have soldered everything into place. Again, I soldered the green wire to the TX pad, white wire to the RX pad, uh, black wire to the ground.

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Uh, and red to the five volt. So, uh, I am done essentially, uh, with the actual hardware related stuff.

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Now let's hop on into beta flight and, uh, show you how to set everything up.

157
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So we are in beta flight now, ready to do everything that we have to do on here.

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
My quad is connected on com five and we are ready to go.

159
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Uh, I'm ready to go.

160
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm ready to go.

161
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm ready to go.

162
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm ready to go.

163
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm ready to go.

164
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm ready to go.

165
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm ready to go.

166
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm ready to go.

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm ready to go.

168
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm ready to go.

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Uh, I did go through, uh, about half of it.

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Uh, and I tried recording it before.

171
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Um, and I forgot to record the audio.

172
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So I'm doing this all over again.

173
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's why if you see certain tabs already, uh, clicked on, uh, it's because of that.

174
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So, uh, let's go on into com five connect and we have our quad here, all connected and ready.

175
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Um, the GPS logo is not showing up because I don't have a battery connected.

176
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you don't connect your body, you're going to be able to connect.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So, uh, let's go on into the next one.

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So, uh, let's go on into the next one.

179
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So, uh, let's go on into the next one.

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So, uh, let's go on into the next one.

181
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You'll be able to do that with your battery.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
One, two, three, three, four, three, four.

183
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you're connected, you're connected.

184
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If you don't connect your battery, it won't show up.

185
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Uh, so let's go on to ports because this is the first thing you have to do.

186
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Um, I have mine connected to UART 2.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
As you saw, I connected it to TX2 and RX2.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That is correct.

189
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Correct.

190
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Uh, so we go down here to sensor input.

191
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We go from disable to GPS and then we change it from auto to fifty seven thousand six hundred.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Cause that's the one that dislikes.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So what we do after that is click save and reboot and you'll hear a go.

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,620
There it is.

195
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,620
And now we go back and click connect.

196
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,380
Now let's go on to the configuration tab.

197
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,000
This is the next tab that we have to go to.

198
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,660
You see my craft name is SuperFPV.

199
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,600
We go down here and we click the GPS toggle on.

200
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,140
All right.

201
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,020
I had it on before.

202
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,720
So I just toggled it back on because I wanted to show you it getting toggled.

203
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,960
So GPS toggle is on.

204
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,120
And we change it from NMEAA, which is most likely where it's going to be on for you guys on Betaflight 4.2.3.

205
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,800
You change it to U-blocks and auto config turned on if you have it turned off.

206
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,300
And then ground assistance type to auto detect.

207
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,720
I remember when I did it, it was at none.

208
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,760
And then I had to change it to auto detect.

209
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,080
So then we go there, do all that, and then click save and reboot.

210
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,160
So this next part, you're going to have to plug in your battery to your quad.

211
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,120
And you want to turn on your controller.

212
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:39,940
Once you have your controller turned on and your battery connected, you also want to set up a switch for the GPS rescue function on your Tyrannus or whatever radio you have.

213
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,680
You want to set up the switch inside the radio first.

214
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:49,900
I can make a separate video on that later on when we talk about setting a beta flight for the introduction to FPV series that I have going on.

215
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:59,000
But if you do not know how to do that, I'll link a video in the description for you guys to see how to do that.

216
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,600
And then once you're done with that, come back over here and continue.

217
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,520
So for those of you guys already done with that step, let's go into this step.

218
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,500
So you go on to your GPS rescue, click add range.

219
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:21,540
And usually you have to set it to auto for the flight controller to detect which specific switch that you're toggling on and off.

220
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,260
So for mine was mine was auxiliary six on my Tyrannus QX7.

221
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,260
And I want this is the on position.

222
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,000
So that means it's it'll be toggled.

223
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,820
And then you toggle on and off to get the precise location.

224
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:48,040
So once you have your switch set up for GPS rescue, you want to click save and then move on to the next step.

225
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,040
The next step is going into your fail save.

226
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:57,060
If you do not have this fail safe option, you want to click enable expert mode and then go on from there.

227
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,600
You want to stage one and then just click GPS rescue.

228
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,300
These are the values that I use because it just seems appropriate.

229
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:15,060
Before I had it at land, which would mean once fail safe is activated, it would just straight up drop out of the sky.

230
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:24,800
Not drop like this, but it would level out and then land or like drop out of the sky in like a more gentle yet pretty quick motion.

231
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:32,060
Now that we have a GPS, we can activate GPS rescue automatically through fail safe.

232
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,820
It'll it'll start to fly back towards us so we can regain signal whenever the signal is lost and fail safe activates.

233
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,780
So that's pretty nice to have.

234
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,140
You don't have to do this, but I would recommend you do if since now you have a GPS.

235
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,740
So click save and reboot after that and then connect back into our next step, which is setting up your OSD.

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
And this is how my OSD looks.

237
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,720
I know there's a lot of information, but these are all pertinent to getting your information from your GPS onto your screen.

238
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,460
So all the necessary GPS related information is down here.

239
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:15,220
You have your GPS latitude and longitude, which is the the coordinates as to where your quad is at the time.

240
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:23,980
Your GPS stats shows the amount of satellites fixated onto your GPS, your specific GPS, whether it be zero or like 20.

241
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,260
So the higher the number, the stronger the signal and the stronger the connection.

242
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,600
GPS speed.

243
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,220
This is the speed that your quad is flying at.

244
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,120
It's kind of cool to see.

245
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,060
I would probably not keep this on at all times unless you have a quad that can go over 100 miles per hour at that.

246
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,220
And you need to monitor the speed that you're going at because over 100 miles per hour is illegal in the United States for your quad to be going.

247
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:51,900
I think without a ham license or whatever licenses that you need or part 107 or whatever it's called.

248
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,060
So that's the GPS speed.

249
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,140
And then home direction is very important because this is the main reason you bought a GPS to put on your quad.

250
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,200
It's so you know which direction is home.

251
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,240
This little arrow you see right here, that's the home direction.

252
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,580
It'll start moving towards your your home.

253
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,160
And then home distance is how far you are from home.

254
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,320
All of this information is relative except for the GPS latitude and longitude.

255
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:13,780
That's not.

256
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,160
That's actually like positional accuracy to where where you are.

257
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,960
But all of this everything else is relative to the moment you activate or arm your quad.

258
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,880
You got to remember that.

259
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,040
So every time you arm your quad your home direction changes or your your home location changes.

260
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,280
So if you pick it up move it like 10 feet to your right that's your new home and then arm it that's your new home direction.

261
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,160
And the distance changes depending on that.

262
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,500
So I had this right here is the GPS speed.

263
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,980
As you can see it's highlighting for me GPS speed.

264
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,300
This is the home direction.

265
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,920
This is the home distance as you can see is 432 meters away from home apparently.

266
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,940
And my name is Joe Pilot.

267
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,420
It's not.

268
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,760
It's actually supposed to be Super FPV.

269
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,640
And this is the satellite link.

270
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,480
And this is longitude and latitude.

271
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,320
This is how I have mine set up.

272
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,880
You guys can set it up whichever way you want.

273
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
And that's completely up to you.

274
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,260
And after that you're done.

275
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,500
And you click save.

276
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:14,520
Finally I want to go through the CLI tab and show you an introduction to a few of the commands that you might want to change.

277
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:15,980
There are a lot of commands.

278
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,920
And let me show you real quick what all the commands are by typing get gps underscore rescue.

279
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,940
And you have all these commands that show up.

280
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,380
And I only really care about three of these commands.

281
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:36,920
And that is gps rescue initial altitude, gps rescue minimum satellites, and gps rescue minimum distance to home.

282
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,960
Everything else I don't quite care about.

283
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,640
I am fine with default values.

284
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,040
You guys can go in and change them up if you would like.

285
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:54,100
Simply by typing set space and then whatever value it is and equals to whatever value you want as long as it's between the allowed range.

286
00:19:54,100 --> 00:20:05,920
For the three that I mentioned, gps rescue initial altitude, this is the altitude that it will fly up to when you activate the gps rescue switch.

287
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:10,920
So for me it's 70 meters up in the air, which is plenty high enough for my area.

288
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,140
You guys can go all the way up to 100 if you want.

289
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:18,320
And then lastly, the last two would be gps rescue minimum satellites.

290
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:28,280
This is the minimum satellites that you can have before you're actually allowed to click the gps rescue switch and have everything working properly.

291
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,580
So yeah, the default value is 8.

292
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:37,460
I changed it to 5 because 8 seems like a decently too much amount.

293
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:50,820
And I want to be able to activate it whenever I want to activate it versus like if you have like since the default value was 8, if I had like 7 satellites, I wouldn't be able to rescue my drone.

294
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,760
So I wanted the lowest possible one.

295
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,380
It doesn't matter.

296
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:00,300
It's up to you guys if you want a stronger signal or a weaker signal when you activate gps rescue.

297
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,220
And then gps rescue minimum distance to home.

298
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:15,320
This is the minimum distance that you're allowed to fly before you are allowed or no, the minimum distance that you need to fly before you're allowed to flip the switch and actually activate gps rescue.

299
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,280
For me, I put it at the bare minimum, which is 50 just in case I'm flying in a very difficult area.

300
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,040
And even if I go 50 meters away from home, I have no idea where I am.

301
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,800
Like it's all broccoli once you're up there, you know, all the trees kind of just look like broccoli at that point.

302
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,240
So for me, I minimum distance to home, I did 50.

303
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,920
And that's about it.

304
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:42,760
Once you do all the value changes, be sure to type in save, enter, and then it'll save and restart your quad and everything.

305
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,200
All right.

306
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,100
So once you're done with all those steps, the final piece of the puzzle is to just take the drone outside and have like a free open space.

307
00:21:51,100 --> 00:22:02,360
Like don't have any sort of like barrier between the GPS and the sky and then let it sit for about five minutes with the battery plugged in and it should automatically detect the satellites.

308
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:09,560
It takes a while for the first time you activate your GPS or like the first flight or the first area you're in.

309
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:17,320
It takes like about five minutes for it to find all the satellites and actually initiate your location and everything.

310
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:27,960
So I'd say like if you let's say you're in Texas and then you fly over to Atlanta and you're there, the GPS won't automatically like lock on or anything.

311
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:40,620
It will take a little while for you're going to have to do that whole initiation step where you sit outside for about five minutes with the battery plugged in and let it try and find the satellites and everything.

312
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,200
So if you don't see like if you're on your beta flight, it says like GPS fix false.

313
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,440
Don't be alarmed.

314
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,700
It's probably because you haven't let it sit enough for enough time.

315
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,840
So that that's probably the issue.

316
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,280
And that's it for that.

317
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:04,480
And next I'm gonna I'm gonna go out in the field and actually show you how everything works really quickly and then we'll end up the video.

318
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,100
Alrighty.

319
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,960
In this clip, you can see my entire OSD.

320
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,380
Everything that you're seeing you're seeing is what I saw when I was flying for the first time with the GPS on.

321
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
As you can see, I have 11 satellites connected.

322
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,460
Now it's 10 or 9, 8.

323
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,880
It just keeps fluctuating on the bottom right.

324
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:26,540
And then I have an arrow pointing to home on the bottom left with distance to home on the bottom left as well.

325
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,700
And the speed that I'm flying at and the top.

326
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:34,080
You can also see the longitude and latitude numbers.

327
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,520
So, I mean, that's pretty much it for the GPS.

328
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:45,740
Now, if I was to fly a certain distance, like, you know, quite far away and then click my GPS rescue button, it would automatically level out.

329
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,240
Toggle my GPS.

330
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:56,840
Like you would actually toggle the GPS rescue mode and start flying towards me after it reaches that altitude that I that I set in the CLI tab.

331
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,600
So, that's pretty much it.

332
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,000
Thank you so much for watching.
