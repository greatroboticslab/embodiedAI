So of course that just can't be\nright. You can see boxes everywhere in home theater with ports which are way small than that\nwith subs which are comparable to this one here. So first off I'm going to be looking at problems\nwith ports which are too small. Now in order for two things to be just as loud they need to move\nthe same amount of air. So for a 5 centimeter port and a 20 centimeter wide port, air needs to be moving\n16 times faster through the 5 centimeter port than the 20 centimeter port. That's why this one here is\nso large because it's trying to avoid air rushing through the port so quickly and creating turbulence.",

      "coverage_text": "So turbulence is created when air is moving out of the port very quickly and it meets this kind of\nbarrier where it goes from fast throwing all coherent into just an open space and it all goes to hell.\nThere's air moving everywhere, turbulence forms which is the leading cause of chuffing which is a common\nthing with ported boxes and here you can see that with the large port because the air is moving more\nslowly through it there's a lot less turbulence and thus there's a lot less chuffing. You can of course\nflare it and you can see here with the large port that there's no more turbulence at all but with a\nsmall port there's still a bit of turbulence. Now you can if you make the port super big you can get away\nwith getting no turbulence through a small port but then you may as well go with a large port in the\nfirst case. Although you do get a bit more box space efficient if you do a small port with huge\nflares on either end. I see it in some compact bookshelf speakers such as KEF has a silicone port,\nlike a flexible port which has a big flare on the front and the rear. As for the characteristics of a\nsmall port dynamics can suffer meaning that kicks aren't quite as tight and it leads to a muddy sound.",

      "coverage_text": "So that's often why a small port or a port which is too small is actually good for home theater sub.\nRumbles don't need to be particularly accurate they're more or less just noise so any infrasonics you can\nactually use a small port and flare it at either end just to save a bit of box volume because by the\ntime you try to make a relatively small unit try to tune it to 20 hertz the port would need to be so\nwide it's absolutely enormous its length is two meters plus in some cases. So if you make it smaller\nyou can fit it all within the box nicely without having to sacrifice any sound quality due to it being\ntuned low. And now I'm going to talk about problems with ports which are too big. With a correct size\nport when you stop setting power to the voice coil it should stop making sound. This is a common reason\nwhy people prefer sealed to ported because ported can lose definition the port can be wanting to do its\nown thing and this is a bit of an example of that. So when you stop sending power to the voice coil sound\nshould stop immediately and with with properly damped ports you'll see that as soon as the signal\nstops the wave should stop. But a problem with large ports is that the damping is less so even after the\nsignal stops going to the driver a bit of air can keep moving in and out of the port like when you blow\nover a bottle and you hear a go hmmm. So what this leads to is the sound coming from the speaker is less\ntight less accurate and has a bit of a kind of boomy nature to it. It wants to peak more around the port\nand yeah that's not very good for sound quality but it is good for SPL because you want a big\nhigh resonance so going with a big port for SPL is often a good thing. So what is the best size for a\nport? If I've talked about what's bad about small what's bad about large what's the best compromise?\nAnd I do actually have an answer. I've seen this in many different places and it all seems to line\nup the same thing. The best way to design a ported box is to go with 16 square inches per cubic foot\nwhich ends up being 100 square centimeters per 28 liters or 3.6 square centimeters per liter of box\nvolume. So these are all port surface area to box volume ratios. For a 10 cubic foot box you want 160\nsquare inches which is like a big 16 by 10 inch port or maybe a 32 by 5 inch port something like that\nand of course you can do the calculations for the metric yourself if you want to do them. These are all\nfor square or rectangular ports. If you're doing a round port you can actually make the box bigger than\none cubic foot per 16 square inches. You can make ports smaller if they're more aerodynamic. So if you've\ngot a flared port you can make the port slightly smaller. If you've got an aero port you can make it smaller.",

      "coverage_text": "Also if you do have a round port compared to a rectangular or square port you can make it smaller.\nAnd if you have an un-aerodynamic port such as a rectangular port that has a corner in it which\ndoesn't have any sort of curving in the corner then you can make it slightly bigger than 16 square\ninches per cubic foot maybe 20 square inches per cubic foot as the restriction of airflow damps it\njust a bit more so it doesn't ring. A couple of examples of where I found this ratio before I\ntested it in a box myself and found out that it does work pretty damn well is here on digital design\nsite. You can see their one cubic foot box has more 15 square inches of vent but two is 32, three is 48\nand they all divide to go to 16 square inches of port area per cubic foot. This is quoted on the website.\nAnother example I'd look at is on Sundown's website where I found the NSV4 10 inch driver.",

If you enjoyed this video and learned anything from it\nuh feel free to like and subscribe and also just wondering what's your opinion. Now I've seen other\nsizes in other videos for example comparing port surface area with driver surface area for example\nShowtime SPL Ed Leicester. He mentions that he tunes his ports per driver surface area for SPL. So yeah that's\nan example where in SPL it's often a good idea to tune the port surface area to the driver surface area\nrather than the box volume. But once again feel free to leave your own opinion in the comments below.\nI look forward to seeing how other people do it and I might even test some of them if they sound good.",
