These holes are evenly spaced and are approximately 2.5mm in size. The holes are arranged in a grid pattern across the board, with a total of 20 holes in total. The holes are not filled with any material, and are left empty.\n\nThe board is placed on a black background, which provides a stark contrast to the copper color of the board. The background is not visible, but it is likely a dark or black color, which complements the copper color of the board.\n\nThe image does not contain any text or other objects. The focus is solely on the circuit board and its features. The image does not provide any information about the board's purpose or function. It is simply a visual representation of a bare circuit board."
