They're about the same price. So I initially bought this one, and this is like your basic, just plugs into a UART, well, a TX and an RX pad of the same UART, and then your power and ground.\nAnd that's it. It has no telemetry or anything like that to it. It is just your basic GPS system.\nBut the 880 GPS, this one actually has, you can see how much thicker that one is in comparison. It's bigger and thicker. This one actually offers telemetry, has telemetry built into it.\nAnd you actually plug it into your SCA or, no, SDA or SCL pads. Your RX and TX of the same UART, and your ground and power. So it's got more cords. It plugs into a UART just like this one, but it also plugs into the SCL and SDA on your board.\nSo what does this mean for you if you're trying to find GPS to fly?\nSo what a lot of people are getting into when it comes to GPS is a sub-250, and that's because of the FAA regulations and stuff that are coming down with 250 grams and trying to keep everything under 250 grams.",
