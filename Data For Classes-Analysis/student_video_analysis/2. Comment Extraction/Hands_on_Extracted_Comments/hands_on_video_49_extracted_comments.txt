Brother i use tmc 2209 drivers what should i change in code

nice job .... Can you tell me what engine power did you use double nema 23?

This is exactly what I would like to learn how to do, but have very little base knowledge. Where do you recommend getting started? Great project!

can your bot rotate the wrist automatically to pick up a banana is different orientations?  seems like a super difficult problem to solve.

Hello can you please give your mail id if possible as I have few doubt to ask as I'm working on a ROS project.

Can you show the arduino configuration like the wires where you plug it in. Is this available in python

i sent you a email, check it out!

Could you show me the 3D models and the technical design of this robot please ???

Hanzhen harmonic drive gear ,  robot arm gear ,  mechanical joint gear ,   over 30 years experience

Great Job! I am studying Mechatronic engineering and want to learn how to make this type of projects but don't know what I have to learn object recognition and how to combine this knowledge with robotics 😓😓

Hello Jesse !  I hope that you are doing fine .  First of all I want to thank you for the knowledge and fun you've shared with us .  I'm so interested about this project and iam willing to realize it . I just want to change 2 things :  1- the datasets you have used ( COCO, pet , .. ) , i want to add other datasets in order that the camera will detect industrial objects . 2-  the predifined trajectories for the detected objects .  I am new in the computer vision & AI , i don't know much things about it .  So can you please tell me what scripts and algorithms should i change ?  And what advices to give me ? Much thanks !

I‘m very impressed! Well done! Please Post more! Can I get in contact with you. I‘ ll build the same Idea

Make more videos please i miss you

How much is this movement footage sped up?

Where I can find the CAD files of the arm?

Hey Jesse, I'm trying to build the same project, could you send me a link for the CAD model, I want to work more on OpenCV, tf, ROS part.  Thanks!

Hello everyone this is my robotic project : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPaVLf3wQvo I need your supports. thank you in advance  ! <3

Hallo, ist es möglich den Roboterarm zu einem 3D-Drucker umzubauen?

Can u provide me the CAD FILE?

Use yolov7..custom train it

you find the CAD files of the arm or not

you find the CAD files of the arm or not

How many kgs of filament required to print arm

Very Cool! I know that was a lot of work! I'm on the path to learning how to do it with an Inmoov Robot

Is that the Logitech c170?

Hi there a lot for the video, I need someone to help me out with this, the thing is that I need to know what is the actual weight of the robot arm.   Can you help me out with this?, I'm starting to buy all of the components!

Los felicito, es muy interesante ver personas que aprovechan la oportunidad de estudiar y lo comparten.

Amazing project. Are you using OpenCV, Python, NumPy?

solo puedo decir wow, eso fue impresionante, felicidades

step by step build video set, i wish more video on youtube from you. its a good work congratulations i love it. nice music choice :)

Do you have link to buy the computer vision? Thanks (AliExpress Ebay Banggood) for Bcn3d robot arm

hi kool work.. What software you are using ??

Great job! Deserves many more view.

Hi, good job . 👏 Could you please tell me the formula used to move the arm to the position of the object ??

Hi ! Great job ! Do yo use TensorFlow for the camera recognition part ?

Hi, can I use the code in a Raspberry Pi Zero? Is it powerfull enough?

Coolll !!!

I like your arm but what materials do you use?

Hey,  Really cool to see this :D. I actually have the same robot printed out, but not so clean due to my 3d printer XD. Currently i controlling it with Gcode and the standard delivered software for the Arduino mega. I planned to step into Ros from the beginning, just began at that and then i came across your robot. Would you be alright if i try running your software on my robot? Jelle Stappers

did you manage to find out what camera he used?

Tensorflow, OpenCV, and ROS

@jesseweisberg5281  como puedo obtener los kits de ese brazo robotico

it's open-source (free!): https://github.com/jesseweisberg/moveo_ros/tree/master/moveo_moveit/scripts

Tensorflow, OpenCV, and ROS

Its called inverse kinematics. You can take the MIT's opencorseware

yes, more details here: https://github.com/jesseweisberg/moveo_ros/tree/master/moveo_moveit/scripts

there's only one way to find out!

The arm is printed with PLA.  A full BOM can be found here: https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo/blob/master/BOM/BCN3D%20Moveo%20BOM.pdf

Jelle Stappers yes of course, and let me know how it works!

Jesse Weisberg i will let you know when i have it running :)
