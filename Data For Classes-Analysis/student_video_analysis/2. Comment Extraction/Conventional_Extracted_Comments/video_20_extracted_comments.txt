Bucky you need to make more vidoes on Electronics, hardware is where its at!

Read your comment mate lol its far, far worse then some noob posting first or second for the lol. Get a life.

I'm confused. All that person said was "2nd comment". Is there some kind of hidden message that I don't get?

thats what she said :D

i have the 9v battery but i dont have the multimeter. i think it doesnt matter becauszz i know its working.

Why get a boner because someone said 1st comment and 2nd comment. It doesn't matter. Let the person do what they want. There are people liek you all over youtube you just sit there and rage at people for doing something whcih they are perfectly obliged to do. Get a life.
