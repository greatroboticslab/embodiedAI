1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,540
Alright, so I wanted to make this quick video just to kind of show you two of the prominent GPS systems that you can buy on Amazon if you just put in FPV GPS.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:20,680
At first, whenever I was first getting into GPS, I really didn't know the difference between these two when it comes to size, how they perform, and things like that.

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:38,200
And so I initially bought this one. They're about the same price. So I initially bought this one, and this is like your basic, just plugs into a UART, well, a TX and an RX pad of the same UART, and then your power and ground.

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,940
And that's it. It has no telemetry or anything like that to it. It is just your basic GPS system.

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:01:01,120
But the 880 GPS, this one actually has, you can see how much thicker that one is in comparison. It's bigger and thicker. This one actually offers telemetry, has telemetry built into it.

6
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:25,960
And you actually plug it into your SCA or, no, SDA or SCL pads. Your RX and TX of the same UART, and your ground and power. So it's got more cords. It plugs into a UART just like this one, but it also plugs into the SCL and SDA on your board.

7
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:33,540
So what does this mean for you if you're trying to find GPS to fly?

8
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:46,060
So what a lot of people are getting into when it comes to GPS is a sub-250, and that's because of the FAA regulations and stuff that are coming down with 250 grams and trying to keep everything under 250 grams.

9
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:52,740
I don't have a weigh thing, but this is significantly heavier than this one. It's just got a lot more to it.

10
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,980
It's bigger, wider, and just thicker than the 220.

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,780
And so that's one huge difference in it if you're trying to do sub-250.

12
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:14,300
If you're just trying to build a big long-range GPS FPV drone, then that really doesn't matter.

13
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:25,280
But the main thing I think that really matters to a lot of pilots is the internal telemetry when it comes to this GPS system here.

14
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,620
I mean, maybe it's not going to matter too much to you if you're flying something like Crossfire.

15
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:47,920
You can see with this small one here, you can actually plug it directly to, or you can solder it directly to those pads there on your Crossfire.

16
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:56,440
And you can also, if you're flying with OpenTX, the TX-16S, or I think the jumper does the same thing,

17
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,060
you can actually go in and reset the pins on your Crossfire and set it up perfectly for this.

18
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,040
It uses less cord. It's a lighter GPS system and everything.

19
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:16,500
And your Crossfire with a Tyrannus or TX-16S or the jumper, you'll have telemetry anyway.

20
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,800
So you don't really need the extra telemetry here.

21
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,720
You can just use one of these little plug-and-plays and you can get everything out of a GPS system that you need.

22
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,900
But if you're, say, you're flying something super cheap like the FlySky,

23
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,600
FlySky, and I think they might have one receiver that offers telemetry.

24
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,700
I'm not exactly sure, but all the cheaper receivers that go with this transmitter,

25
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,280
your drone just doesn't know where it is.

26
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,780
It has no telemetry or anything with it.

27
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:54,380
So when you plug in, play something like this, it's going to give you your speed,

28
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,900
your distance from your home point, and it's going to give you a home point.

29
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,900
But it's really, it's going to know where you're at kind of by the GPS and stuff.

30
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,700
But when I flew around with it, my directional arrow was never correct.

31
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,900
And so I never actually tried the rescue mode with it because I think without having the telemetry,

32
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,660
I don't think it would have worked anyways.

33
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,640
Actually, no. Yeah, I did. I did it once.

34
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,960
I hit the GPS rescue and it just dropped out of the sky.

35
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,700
I forgot all about that.

36
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:30,460
So I wouldn't recommend using this along with a cheaper receiver and cheaper transmitter setup

37
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,860
because you're just not going to have that extra telemetry between the receiver and your drone

38
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,660
that's going to feed the information into the GPS to kind of lock everything in exactly where it needs to be.

39
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:51,900
But if you're running a cheaper FlySky, you can use one of these and an F7 board or F4 or F5 board or something.

40
00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:01,060
As long as you have the SCL and SDA ports on your flight controller, which every flight controller pretty much has it.

41
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:12,120
I'm pretty sure, at least nowadays, I'm going to show you guys the pinup on a Zeus, an HTMLRC Zeus.

42
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:22,440
You can see right here it has the pinup for your GPS, which this is a different GPS.

43
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,060
It has a different pin readout and everything to it.

44
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,900
And this is why I took the original pin out.

45
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,920
That's a good thing about this one, too, that's different is this one doesn't have any soldering ports.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,140
And a lot of people that build these drones know that these plug-in things like this, they don't really last very long.

47
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,200
But there's nowhere to solder directly to the GPS.

48
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,020
This one actually has little solder points down in the bottom.

49
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,440
So it makes it a whole lot easier and you don't have to use the pin.

50
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,820
So I just ran a plug here because this has no GPS on the top part of the board.

51
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,680
But it only has it at the bottom part of the board.

52
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,140
The SCL and SDA here.

53
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:14,740
Which I could being, I could run this to the Zeus and just put it on the top point somewhere.

54
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:22,920
And run a crossfire to this and it'll be fine as long as I'm using one UART that's not in use at the moment.

55
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,820
Like the three, you know, right there or something.

56
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:36,520
But I'm currently, my Zeus board in my actual drone, it's the only one that I'm actually running FlySky on still.

57
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,440
So, I mean, I'm using this, I'm bound with this TX-16S.

58
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:48,480
But I still, I'm trying to, what I want to do is make a video of the difference between the two and how they perform.

59
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:58,200
With an OpenTX, TX-16S transmitter and a regular cheap FlySky receiver.

60
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,180
I'm not using the actual FlySky transmitter.

61
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,680
I want to start with this one because it's got the most to it.

62
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,660
And I haven't really gotten that much testing and stuff done with this.

63
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,100
I haven't actually gotten to use it all that much because as soon as it came in, I decided not to run GPS.

64
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:19,700
I hooked it up like once to one of my drones and then I disconnected it and haven't used it.

65
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,540
I didn't really do any testing and stuff on it.

66
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,260
So, I made the plug to match here.

67
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,260
And then soldered directly to there.

68
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,840
And I'm going to get that one.

69
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,380
And plus, I like using these.

70
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,060
And this one's perfect for it.

71
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,820
If you just want to test the speed, get the speed of your drone.

72
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,220
A lot of people like to do that.

73
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,120
I like to do that.

74
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,700
I like to see how my motor situation is whenever I get new motors.

75
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:59,400
Like I got these cheap 2700 kV motors that are like $30 for a whole set that are on my drone that has the Zeus.

76
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:08,100
And so, I really want to get the speed of it and kind of just do some testing on that to see how fast it goes and how much power we can put through it.

77
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,380
And they're only rated up to 4S, but I already know that they can handle 5S easily.

78
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,340
So, I just want to do some testing on, you know, the speed and accuracy and things like that.

79
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,560
And having a GPS really helps you test everything.

80
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,280
So, I mean, I think this one will be fine for it.

81
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,060
And I'll probably end up hooking that one up just to at least get the speed and stuff.

82
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,320
But I'd like to get this one working on it.

83
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,340
So, yeah, that's a huge thing is the soldering directly to it.

84
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,260
And then whenever I get done with this, I can just cut that or unsolder it and make a new cord for it.

85
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:50,620
One of the bad things about both of these is they send you these connectors that have some nylon wrapping to them.

86
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,340
And I hate nylon because as soon as you start soldering, they melt a whole lot faster up.

87
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,200
And not only that, they're so stiff and everything.

88
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,140
And so this is my first cord that I ended up making.

89
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,960
And what I did is I spliced silicone cords with the nylon cords and put them together.

90
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,940
But I don't like doing that.

91
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,300
I like to have a direct cord.

92
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,540
I don't like to have a splice in the middle of it.

93
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,860
I've never had a problem with silicone.

94
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,520
So, I went and created new connections that are made out of silicone.

95
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:30,400
And I would suggest if you're using these to just throw out your nylon ones and put silicone ones on it.

96
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,200
Solder directly to this because it has a special, you can see the bumps on the top of it.

97
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,340
It has a special connection thing just like some VTXs and stuff do.

98
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:47,440
And I couldn't find one that replicated this exact feature in my group of stuff.

99
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,180
So, soldering directly onto it helped.

100
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,140
This one's just a basic cord, a basic connection.

101
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,360
So, it was really easy to swap that one out.

102
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,240
I'm going to show you guys on my computer.

103
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,360
Both of these have the same setup on the computer that you can do to it.

104
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,840
And I'm just going to show you my basic setup.

105
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:14,860
If you're looking to set these up on yours and you're kind of wondering what you need to do to get them set up and get them working.

106
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,360
I'm going to just show you guys that and you guys can just follow along and hook yours up.

107
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,140
I hope you guys enjoyed this video.

108
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,440
It's just a real quick comparison.

109
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,240
Hopefully, to just help you make some final decisions.

110
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm not going into great detail on either one of them.

111
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,800
But they're both pretty decent GPS systems and they just have completely different...

112
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:40,780
They have two different purposes when it comes to GPS and hooking up GPS to your drone.

113
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,920
So, hopefully this has been helpful.

114
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,360
So, I've got the 800 hooked up to this.

115
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,300
But I'm going to show you guys the settings that I used to do this because I actually messed with it for a while and had to try to figure some things out.

116
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:05,220
But there's not very many videos unless you want to go through like a long video talking about GPS with Josh or something.

117
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,760
And so, I'm just going to try to make this as quick as possible.

118
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,180
These are pretty intuitive.

119
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:19,580
And as long as you've got, you know, the boards nowadays, it's pretty easy to plug and play these things really quick and just get the gist of it.

120
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:25,360
So, we're going to move over to the computer and I'm going to show you exactly the settings that I had on this.

121
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
Just so I can give some people out there an idea if you're trying to hook up GPS.

122
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,680
Alright, so here we are.

123
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,740
In Betaflight.

124
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:41,360
And the first thing you want to do is go over to ports.

125
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,460
And I've got mine hooked up to UART 2.

126
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,280
It's the only one that I can plug a GPS to apparently on this.

127
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,900
I mean, I could use a different one.

128
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,680
But I would have to splice wires and solder and things like that.

129
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,400
But it's just easier for the whole connection point to go on to.

130
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
You can see GPS here.

131
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,340
You just come over and it's usually on disabled.

132
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,200
But you just click on GPS.

133
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,060
And then the, uh, this right here, you can leave it on auto.

134
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
And what it did for me is it picked the correct one.

135
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:21,380
So, as soon as I saved and rebooted and went to configuration, I came back to the ports.

136
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,840
And this was here.

137
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,200
Now, I watched a video and it said to put it on this one.

138
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,460
And when I had it set on that, it didn't work.

139
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,560
So, go figure.

140
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,980
I just left it on auto and then came back to it.

141
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,720
And this was, this was here.

142
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,160
So, that is apparently the right one.

143
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,840
I don't know exactly what these are for.

144
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,840
So, my knowledge on this is a little slim.

145
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,820
So, take it for what it is.

146
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,480
I'm just showing you a basic setup.

147
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm not trying to tell you the, the, in details of how all this stuff works.

148
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,460
I'm just trying to give you a quick thing.

149
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,480
So, you can go through and, and hook your GPS too.

150
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,160
And then, it's a little less troubleshooting for you in the end.

151
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,200
So, then you just save and reboot.

152
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,940
Go to configuration.

153
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,920
And I think I need to turn on my telemetry.

154
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,860
And I wonder if that is why my compass isn't working.

155
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm going to turn it on.

156
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,800
But the main thing that you need to do is come down here and turn on GPS.

157
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,880
I got U-blocks.

158
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,440
U-blocks got this one to work.

159
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,420
I had any MEA because I thought that was the right protocol.

160
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,120
But for this one, for mine, U-blocks is the one that worked.

161
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,840
You can click Autobot if you want to.

162
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,820
And it will auto-generate that.

163
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,900
But you can turn that off.

164
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,540
You can turn it on.

165
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,140
It doesn't matter.

166
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,500
So, I got the Autobot on and the auto-configure.

167
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,280
The ground assist type is auto-detect.

168
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,660
And I've got this just set at zero for now until I figure.

169
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm going to look more in-depth into this stuff here.

170
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,160
And once I figure more out, then I'm going to know the correct.

171
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
But this is what gets it working right now.

172
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,940
So, that's basically it.

173
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,280
And then I'm going to troubleshoot and kind of see what works and what doesn't.

174
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,580
And what makes the GPS better.

175
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,880
So, there may be a point two to this video in the future.

176
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,780
But once you get that set, you save and reboot.

177
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,640
Then you can come over to your failsafe.

178
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
And I'll get back to this here.

179
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,080
This GPS rescue here.

180
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,820
What you need to do is just click on GPS rescue.

181
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,840
And you can set all this stuff if you want to.

182
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,040
I'm not going to go through each one of them.

183
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
This is like your angle that it flies back.

184
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
And that kind of picks the speed.

185
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:55,220
So, if it's flying at an angle of like 25, in order for the horizon to be centered, it's going to have to go at a specific speed.

186
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,780
So, I mean that kind of your angle depicts the speed that it comes back.

187
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,880
So, the higher your angle, the faster it will come back.

188
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,020
I know it has your throttle.

189
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,820
Let's see your maximum throttle and your minimum throttle and your ground speed and stuff like this.

190
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,580
But in order to get that angle, it needs to go to a specific speed.

191
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,460
So, I'm imagining.

192
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,400
And you can leave a comment.

193
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,320
Correct me if I'm wrong.

194
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,320
But I'm imagining the angle determines how fast it comes back.

195
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:26,260
So, go through and set all these.

196
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,700
And hit save and reboot.

197
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,480
And you can come to your modes.

198
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,080
And you can set your GPS rescue.

199
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
I've got mine on three.

200
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,020
And this is where that fail safe thing comes in.

201
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,820
Because you've got the 1800 here and the 2000 here.

202
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,960
So, what you can do in order to get your GPS rescue to work is come back here to your fail safe.

203
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
And this is going to be set on hold.

204
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,480
Put it as set.

205
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,180
And put one of those numbers, 1800 or 2000 or whatever, is in the yellow that you see.

206
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,200
And as soon as it flips over and passes that mark, it will go in the GPS rescue.

207
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,360
So, once you get your GPS rescue, you just hit save.

208
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,740
And come down to GPS and check this out.

209
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,420
You can see that it's already starting to work.

210
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,180
We've got one.

211
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,680
I'm inside the house.

212
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,220
So, having one is pretty significant.

213
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:33,620
Your first time firing this up at any new spot or location, it's going to take a while.

214
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:40,860
So, the problem with this drone that I have it hooked up to right now is it has a problem overheating quickly.

215
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
And then it just starts resetting.

216
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,820
And I don't know why.

217
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:54,820
So, for right now, I have to set this outside with a cooling fan on it until it gets, if I'm in a new spot.

218
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,000
Typically, what happens is it takes a while in the first spot.

219
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,900
When you're at a brand new area, it's going to take a while to lock on.

220
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,700
But any time after that, you can plug in and it's going to lock on almost immediately.

221
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,800
It's really good at it.

222
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,160
So, it just depends on the new spot.

223
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:26,680
And because this one overheats, if you can leave a comment, this is the Zeus, the HGLRC Zeus board.

224
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:35,640
And I've got, and I don't know if it's the VTX that's overheating or if it's the Mamba 50 MPSCs.

225
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,240
It's kind of a hodgepodge.

226
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,660
I've got just mismatched stuff all on it.

227
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,840
But it just overheats and it restarts and all this.

228
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,380
It's frustrating.

229
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,420
It drives me insane.

230
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,460
So, I put a little pocket fan on it and it stays cool enough until the GPS is there.

231
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,300
And then once it gets locked on, I just remove it and start it.

232
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:02,560
And then while the rotors are running, it keeps it cool and it doesn't have any problems after that.

233
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,760
So, I just want to test these motors.

234
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,040
That's, you know, once you figure out your GPS, then you can come down to your OSD.

235
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,400
You can set your, you know, you've got your GPS stuff here.

236
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,680
So, you can see which one each of these are.

237
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:24,540
So, this is your GPS stats, your home distance, your aero.

238
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:29,120
And like I said, I couldn't get the aero to work correctly.

239
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,840
I don't know if just not having the telemetry off knocks the compass off or something.

240
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,900
But I'm fixing to go out there and retest it here in a second to make sure everything's working okay.

241
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,700
But then you push save and that's everything.

242
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:57,340
So, you've got your OSD, GPS, your modes, your receiver, or not your receiver, but your failsafe, and configuration and ports.

243
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,660
So, that's all backwards.

244
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:05,000
So, ports, configuration, your failsafe, modes, check your GPS.

245
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:09,740
And this right here, you'll know if it's working or not by plugging it in.

246
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,180
Number one, it's got, and you can't see it right now because of the light that's on it, but it's got a blue light that's on it.

247
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:24,280
That when it's flashing, that tells you that it's trying to pick up and transmit a signal and shows that this is working.

248
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,520
The way that you can tell that this is communicating with your board is right here.

249
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,980
That you'll start seeing numbers here.

250
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,000
So, when it's not working, all this will be at zero and nothing will be happening.

251
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:44,420
But, as soon as you get it working and actually sending and receiving, and you have it on the right one, and that's what was happening to me,

252
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,180
is I was in configuration and I had this one picked.

253
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,100
And when I went back to GPS, nothing was happening here.

254
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,220
So, you can obviously see that it's sending and receiving and all that stuff.

255
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,820
So, that's just a quick way to hook this up without having to dial in deep and try to explain everything and what everything is to a T.

256
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,920
I'll make a 2.0 if you guys want it, but this will at least help you get this thing set up.

257
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,220
Get it in the air.

258
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,940
And then if you want to do some different things, you can come back and troubleshoot stuff.

259
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,840
Just like I still have to troubleshoot the directional arrow.

260
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,620
And it might be, depending on the way that you put this, there's a front and a back to this.

261
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:42,660
But that really shouldn't matter because if you have it flip backwards, then it's just like it's flying backwards the entire time.

262
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,420
The arrow should still point to home.

263
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,820
So, I don't get how that is incorrect.

264
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:56,600
And I'm afraid to hit the fail safe even though as I'm flying out, you can see the distance getting bigger.

265
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,900
And as I'm coming closer, you can see the distance from home getting smaller.

266
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,560
So, it knows where the home point is.

267
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,060
I'm just afraid that it's going to go in the direction of that arrow or that's going to throw it off or something's going to happen.

268
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:14,540
So, I'm going to take this out and I'm going to test it and test flight and stuff and kind of see where we're at.

269
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,340
And I hope you guys enjoyed this.

270
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,700
Hope this helps you out setting up GPS.

271
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,360
My name is Bryce Michael Arcee.

272
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll see you guys later.

273
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:22,720
Have a good one.
