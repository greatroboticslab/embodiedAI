1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,480
hello and welcome to the channel once again and in today's video we are going to have a look at the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,200
functions of the flysky fsi 6x transmitter that what is in there and what is it for so let's move

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:21,520
into it so here on our transmitter we have got six to ten channels if you don't watch the introductory

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:30,240
video please just click up in there on the i button so if we want to turn on the transmitter just simply

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:37,840
turn on the power button and here we have got our home screen uh this is this indicates our battery

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,920
this is our fly sky the model which we are using right now the name of the model and this is the

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,760
number of the model and here the protocol of the transmitter is work is mentioned that upon which

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,040
protocol is it working right now here we have got the voltage of the transmitter the that is 4.67

9
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:07,600
volts right now and down below when we connect it to our uh our receiver so here we get the voltage of

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:17,440
our receiver and the signal strength so if you want to enter the uh setup menu so just press and hold

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:29,280
ok for two seconds and here we enter to our menu setup so uh here are four buttons two are for the up and

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:37,360
down and here we have got a cancel button so if you want to quit uh uh settings so we just press the

13
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,680
cancel button and ok button is to enter uh settings and to save a setting we just simply have to press

14
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,600
and hold the cancel button for example if i just enter into the system and i just want to select a model

15
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,520
i want it on model 6 and i want to save it so i am just going to have press and hold the cancel button

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:10,400
and it is saved uh now just i just want to counter check it so press ok button it entered into it and

17
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:18,560
it is now on model 6 and it is saved and if i want i don't want to save anything i just want to quit the

18
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,360
same settings as it was before so if now if i change it on model 5 and i don't want to save it

19
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:34,080
i'm just going to press the cancel button once and i'm the settings will be just quit now i check it so

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:43,200
it was saved on model 6. so now here we have got uh two kind of setups that one is the system settings

21
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,760
and one is the setup so in the system settings we basically have got the model settings that which

22
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:58,640
model you want to copy a model and the receiver setups and that is actually mostly related to the

23
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,640
use of your transmitter the basics use and in the function and in the setup menu the functions of

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,640
the transmitter are concerned that how much will be the sensitivity which switch to use for uh which

25
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,600
function so now let's start from the system settings and in the system settings the first one is the

26
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:24,400
model setup the model select so in the model select we just have to select our model here are i think

27
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:33,600
so 20 models that you can have for different kind of uh airplanes or quadcopters you want so you can

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,120
select each for one i don't think so one would use all these 20 in the second one there is a model name

29
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:52,160
so if you want to name a specific model uh for a plane you want so you can do it in here for example in

30
00:03:52,160 --> 00:04:02,640
the model uh for model 6 i just wanted to fly sky here here as i change it in here so with the down

31
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,400
button the name also changes in there and if i press ok so it changes shifts to another alphabet and if i change

32
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,960
one of the way as t or s so here it is and if i want to save it so press and hold cancel and here we

33
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:29,920
have got saved the um the alphabet with which we enter in there and the next one is a model name model type

34
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:38,080
that for which purpose you are using that specific model for an airplane for a helicopter or there are

35
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:47,760
many more setups i don't even use those i'm just using the airplane which works for a quadcopter and our

36
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,840
airplane model too the next one is a model copy so if you want the settings of one model into another

37
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:05,040
so you just use the settings uh if you just set model 5 for example for an airplane and if you are

38
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,840
making another airplane and you want the settings of model 5 to be there in model 6 so you just use

39
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,560
this function the next one is the model reset if you want to reset a model for example i want to reset

40
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:27,840
the model 6 which i which i just renamed right now so i press ok and it asks for uh permission i'm going to

41
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,040
press yes and press ok button and the model will be reset now if i enter into it so the name is again reset

42
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:44,320
to its default uh name the next one is the rx setup that is actually related to your receiver setup that

43
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:53,600
what your receiver uh setups will be so the first one is the rf standard which means that on which protocol you want your

44
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:03,440
receiver to work for example i'm just using this receiver the flysky fsia6b which works on the protocol

45
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:13,840
of the afhds2a you also have some receivers which are working on the protocol of afhds for example i have

46
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:23,280
got this receiver uh which works on the protocol of afhds so uh here we have to mention that which

47
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:34,160
protocol you want to use the next one is the rx battery that uh on which voltage you want an alarm

48
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,000
and on which you want a high setup so uh you just set it from here you also have the option to select

49
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,880
an external sensor which is i think attached in here i don't know i never used it the next one is the

50
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:57,520
failsafe in the failsafe in the failsafe you just uh tell your receiver that what to do upon failsafe if

51
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:05,840
it disconnects from your transmitter so for example i just want channel 3 to be set up on a failsafe i

52
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:17,120
first uh enter into channel 3 i put uh i just press the uh up button to turn it on and the position i want

53
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:24,960
channel 3 to be upon failsafe that for example i want channel 3 my throttle to be on 50 percent upon the

54
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:35,040
failsafe so i put my throttle on 50 percent and press and hold the cancel button so now it is on zero which

55
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:46,720
means that uh my here my throttle is minus 50 percent here is zero and here it will be uh 100 so that is

56
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:57,120
upon zero in the middle and uh my throttle will be on zero or if i just uh get a feel safe some somewhere

57
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,600
the next one is the sensor list in which we get a list of the sensors that which sensors are there and

58
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:13,520
for example right now we just have a sensor which tells us the internal voltage of our transmitter we also

59
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:23,120
have the receiver uh voltage when it is connected to the esc so uh you have the option to connect some

60
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,280
other sensors so you will just get it here listed the next one is two sensors you can have three sensors

61
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:40,480
connected to it i think somehow some sometimes you need uh altitude sensor or i never use that so i don't

62
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,200
know too much about this but it is actually for the sensors use the next one is the speed distance that

63
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,000
you want to use a speed sensor a rotation length or there are some kind of auto meter device which are

64
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,480
used for the measurement of the speed so if you have connected that one to it so you'll get a data of that one in here

65
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
you can just select and set up from here the next one is the esl pressure which means above sea level pressure

66
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:20,560
that is actually used for an altitude sensor you just have to calibrate the pressure uh that upon which

67
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:29,200
the zero position of the altitude sensor must be so here you put the value in and that works according to

68
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,640
this the next one is the output mode that upon which more you want your receiver to work that is actually

69
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:45,840
too much important because sometimes you use a ppm input sometimes you use a pwm output of this receiver

70
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:54,160
sometimes you use it in ibis or espus so you just set it in here so the next one is our ibis setup that

71
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:06,560
our ibis setup which will be on which of the uh receive receiver port on here so we just set it on here

72
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,760
the next one is the server frequency that how much times you want the server to get input each second

73
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,880
actually frequency means that so uh you want to calibrate or set this value according to your

74
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:30,320
server manufacturers give you or you can just put it on 50. uh i never got a problem um regarding this setup

75
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:38,320
so that was that was all about the setup menu and now we will move to the function setup so in the

76
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,280
function setup the first one is the reverse reverse means to reverse a channel the the movement of the

77
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:56,480
channel uh for example i want this stick to uh to pitch down when i move it downwards so uh and and it

78
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,560
moves upwards so i just reversed the channel on which this stick is this stick is i think so on channel

79
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,760
three no no channel four so i don't actually remember that but you just have to reverse that channel

80
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:19,520
that specific channel which you want to to move on the opposite side so the next next one is the display

81
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,960
settings i want the display to tell you first and then i'll come to the end points so in the display

82
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,560
settings you get a display of your moments for example i am moving the aileron here we have got moment of

83
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,040
channel one here we have got the channel three movement which is a throttle so always when you move

84
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:48,160
something you have got a display of that in the display menu so when we move to the end points in the

85
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,840
end points you actually have got the limit of your moment of a specific channel for example i've got my

86
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:04,640
aileron on channel one and i want its throw to be more the throw is actually the moment the area of the

87
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:13,920
moment of your control surface so i want the aileron to move more so i will increase it up to 120 that is the

88
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:24,480
highest limit so in the display actually your uh upon your full moment of your stick it moves up up

89
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:33,280
up till this line but when i want i set it on uh limit up till the 120 then upon the full stick it goes to

90
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:42,000
here up till the end so that is the most like on this side it was 100 so it will move up till this line

91
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and the side which was moved to 120 it moves up till the extreme position so that is actually that is

92
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,920
actually the end point the next one is the aux channels that which are which channel which switch

93
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:04,320
you want on which channel for example for channel 5 i want the uh switch a to be working switch a that is

94
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,720
actually mentioned here so i'll just change it to switch a and i'll press and hold cancel button the next

95
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:19,520
one is the subtrim subtrim is actually the settings of your uh control setting that is actually the tuning

96
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:29,440
of your aircraft for example your rudder or your specific control surface is not aligned so you can just

97
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:40,480
align it here on the sub trim settings that your control sticks will be moved without uh holding your

98
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:48,160
control sticks so it is that kind of setup the do the next one is the dual rate and exponential settings

99
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,360
which is actually the the the sensitivity of your controls i'm going to explain it in detail in a

100
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,280
later video the next one is a throttle curve it actually means that how much your throttle increase

101
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:10,080
upon this movement like for example you want your throttle to be less uh increasing from 0 to 25

102
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:16,880
so you actually increase decrease the value of 25 and the graph will change so it will move

103
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:27,280
from here to 0.1 your throttle will be increasing less and then your throttle will have more ratio of increase

104
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,560
the next one is the mixer setup and mixer setup you actually make one channel the

105
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:42,080
the master and any other the slave and if you want for example there is a phenomenon called uh adverse heel

106
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:52,800
and you want uh your rudder to move automatically upon rolling so you just set the master channel one which is

107
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:01,040
your aileron and the slave as channel two which is your channel four which is your rudder so that will move

108
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:09,120
accordingly the next one is the le one if you want an le one setup of an aircraft you just get it from here the next one is the

109
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:18,800
retail which is also a an aircraft setup so if you want an aircraft to be set up as a a retail aircraft so you set up at

110
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:28,800
set it set it up from here the next option is the assigned switches which means that which switch to assign for which purpose for example i want

111
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:38,080
switch a to be functioning as a throttle hold switch so i select switch a here and i press and hold cancel

112
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:48,320
and when i see here so upon switch a i turn in off the throttle hold function so the next one is a throttle hold and in throttle hold actually we have a

113
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,360
a functionality or a control over our throttle that if we activate it so our throttle will be

114
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:03,600
at the specific position we want for example upon activation of the throttle hold uh function i want

115
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:14,240
my throttle to be at 50 percent or at 60 percent so i want i will set it x at 60 percent and i'll press and

116
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:22,320
hold cancel button to save it so now if i go to the display settings and i want to see its functionality so upon

117
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:28,080
activating the throttles which for example my throttle is at zero right now and if i activate it so my

118
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:35,520
throttle would actually automatically move to 60 percent even if i move at my throttle right now it will not

119
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:45,840
move from its its location which we set in the settings that is 60 percent and if i just deactivate it

120
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,920
so even we can move that again okay so that was all about the flysky fsi 6x transmitter functions if you

121
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,440
like the video please like share and subscribe to the channel and if i miss something please tell me

122
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,760
down in the comments thank you and see you
