1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
The last video where I tested the different materials you would use for a panel and a speaker

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,820
did well, so I thought I would take it a little bit further and test the stuffing

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,620
that you will put inside the box, typically, when you're building a speaker. And I should say up

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,100
front that there's a little bit of confusion surrounding these videos. I'm talking from a

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:24,780
do-it-yourself standpoint here. I'm talking directly to people that build their own speakers

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:30,880
and treat their own rooms or do stuff like that. Not go out and buy a certain product or

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:39,480
a certain piece of gear or equipment. This is almost entirely 100% for the DIY type person.

8
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:48,000
The stuffing that I'm going to be testing is the ever-popular polyfill. That's a mouthful. And you

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,500
can see that I'm weighing it, and that's because this is exactly how much polyfill I have on hand.

10
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,700
So I want the other two materials to match that, which is 58 grams. Now I'm not a big fan of polyfill.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,820
I always thought it was not effective. It was just kind of a placebo. You put it in a box,

12
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,760
you say it's stuffed, but it's not really. Because the stuff is kind of too light, in my opinion.

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:22,420
I've always preferred fiberglass as a stuffing. Okay, even invented boxes. Okay, so the next one is

14
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,340
the fiberglass I talked about. And I'm using the scale to get the right amount of that because I

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,040
definitely have a lot of that on hand. And the last one is rockwool. And once again,

16
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,220
I'll be weighing that to get the right amount to put in the box so that they're all equal in weight.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,740
Okay, not in the space that they take up because rockwool is definitely heavier, denser,

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,460
takes up less space. Also, I changed my test.

19
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,560
This isolates it from the workbench and cleans up the bottom end a lot.

20
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,360
But it doesn't in any way invalidate what I found in the last set of measurements,

21
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,180
because everything came through clearly in that. You can see the differences in the panels.

22
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,840
And we really weren't seeing very much happening down low anyway. So the first set of measurements

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,840
is with the box empty, like before. And this will be the baseline, you could say, the one that

24
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:26,260
we'll compare everything else with. And because there was also a little bit of confusion about this

25
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,540
last time, I'm going to talk about the test setup I have here. How I'm doing these measurements is

26
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:39,720
with this accelerometer, which is taped to the top of the box. This measures how much the panel vibrates

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:48,660
in and out when the speaker is moving. So that energy from the speaker is transferred to the panel

28
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,660
and the panel vibrates and the accelerometer measures that and then it plots it on the computer

29
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:02,440
for every frequency from 30 hertz right up to 2000 hertz. You see the magnitude of that

30
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:08,160
movement. The higher the peaks are, the more that panel is moving. With the empty box measurement done,

31
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:15,200
I can put in the first stuffing sample. And I'm going with polyfill for the first one. And I'm

32
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,960
putting it in half the speaker, the side that doesn't have the driver. And I'm also making sure that the

33
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,500
stuffing actually touches the panel when I put the panel back on. I had a few comments in the last

34
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:33,200
video about, you know, why would the stuffing actually, you know, damp the panel. And what happens

35
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,600
with the stuffing being in the box, whether it's touching the panel or not, is it absorbs some of

36
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,060
the energy from the driver as the driver is operating. And therefore, it can't reach the panel.

37
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:54,800
So the more energy that the stuffing absorbs, the less will reach the panels.

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:06,760
The results from the polyfill come as no surprise to me. It kind of confirms what I was thinking all

39
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,260
along. There's a little bit of a change up higher. And overall, there's a little bit of a drop in

40
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:23,060
output from the panel, but not a huge amount. So I took that out and I put the fiberglass in and I

41
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,820
ran the test again. And here are the results from that.

42
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,080
Once again, not a huge change, but obviously better than the polyfill, especially up higher.

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,960
And across the board, there was a, you know, a better reduction in output from the panel.

44
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:57,500
Then I took out the fiberglass and I put in the rock wool and I tested it again.

45
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,440
And I'm looking at that right here. And there's really not a huge difference between this

46
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:19,220
and the fiberglass. So I'm going to call it a tie between the two. So that takes care of the three

47
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,880
stuffings. And there are other options for that, of course, but I don't have any. But I do have

48
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:32,760
something to damp the panel directly. And that is one eighth inch thick rubber that I can glue right

49
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:40,360
onto the panel in two places. So it avoids that brace in the middle. And I use spray adhesive to put

50
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,840
these on. And I also clamped on a piece of plywood for about an hour to make sure that it was well

51
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,080
stuck on there. It wasn't going to come loose. And then I tested it. And here you can see the results.

52
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,840
This actually had less of an effect than I thought it would. In reality, it doesn't look any better than

53
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,220
the original measurement, not overall. I mean, we still have some pretty big peats up higher.

54
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,400
And there was no overall reduction in the output down lower.

55
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:25,240
So I peeled that off again. And I put a shim on top of the brace so that when I put the panel back in

56
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,320
place, it will be making contact with that brace and effectively cut the panel size in half so that

57
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:35,040
it's well braced and tested it again. And here are the results from that.

58
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:47,460
This shows some significant reduction down low. Also, there's a big dip at 650 that certainly can't

59
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:55,140
hurt. But there are still some higher peaks. So overall, I can't say that that is much of an

60
00:06:55,140 --> 00:07:02,880
improvement over the original. Got major peaks around 900 and 1800 hertz. And those are potentially

61
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,640
more audible than anything you'd find down low. So going from that, I decided to try something else.

62
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,740
And that would be doubling up the panel. So I put the layer of MDF that I had on the side,

63
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:23,500
on top of the oak plywood layer, and tested it again. And here you can see the results from that.

64
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:37,600
That shows significant reduction down low, around 200 to 300. Same, got a bit of a dip between 300 and

65
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:46,160
800. But our 900 hertz resonance is still there. And we're still seeing something around 1800. But

66
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,100
there is quite a valley in between those two. So that is an improvement overall.

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,280
I've got one more thing to try though. And that's what's known as CLD, constrained layer damping.

68
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:05,700
That's where you take a panel and you glue it to another panel with a flexible adhesive in between.

69
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:12,040
In my case, I'm using silicone. I'll spread that on liberally. And then I'll sandwich the other panel

70
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,180
on top. I'm staying with the MDF. And there's no harm in testing it while it's wet. So I'll do that

71
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,520
right away. And we can look at the results here.

72
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,180
Even though you're not reducing as much down low, the response is flatter overall, as in you're losing

73
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:43,160
more up in the high end, which is, I think is better overall. So that was yesterday when I ran all those

74
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:50,760
tests and the silicone wasn't dry. I've left it to dry overnight. And now I can test it again

75
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,700
with the dry. And we'll look at those results.

76
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:06,780
Okay, well, I got them right in front of me. So I can talk about them right here right now. And you can

77
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:15,880
see them as I'm talking. And when I compare them directly to how it looked when it was wet, there's

78
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:23,280
not a significant difference. But there's a definite improvement overall. So if you're looking for the

79
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:31,480
ultimate way to build your speakers, so that you're going to reduce the amount of output from the

80
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:41,180
panels, I would say that it would be a combination of the correct stuffing on the inside. I would avoid

81
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:48,960
polyfill unless you can pack it in there to make up for the, you know, the lightness of it. Also use

82
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:55,100
bracing. I wouldn't say as much as you can, because what happens when you use too much bracing is you,

83
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,060
you can actually make separate boxes inside boxes, and you get different resonances inside the box,

84
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,200
which can be a problem. You have to be very careful about that. I would say, you know, use bracing where

85
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,280
it's needed to cut panels down to size. Like when you put a brace in the middle of a panel,

86
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,420
you're cutting the panel in half. You're making two smaller panels instead of one larger one.

87
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,400
And then to put the icing on the cake, you could do this CLD technique, which seems to be quite

88
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:31,600
effective at reducing the magnitude of the vibrations right across the board.
