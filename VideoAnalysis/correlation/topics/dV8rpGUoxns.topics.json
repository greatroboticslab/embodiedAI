      "coverage_text": "Hey everybody, Kenneth Russell here. I hope you're doing great today. Today I'm talking about cables,\nhow to understand cables and their connectors. Check it out.\nWell, if you're a musician or working in sound in any way, you're going to come across cables\nand all different types of cables. And sometimes it can be kind of daunting if you're just getting\ninto it because there's all these different connectors. You don't know what they're called.\nSo let's talk about the connectors in the first half of this video. And then we're going to talk\nabout the cable itself in the second half of the video. By the way, a huge shout out to Hosea Cables\nfor sending me all these cables. And they're just awesome cables. I've been buying Hosea Cables for\nyears. If you're looking to buy an instrument cable for your guitar or microphone or whatever kind of\ncable you're looking for, don't look any further than Hosea. They really are awesome cables. They\nhave different levels, good, better, best, and they're all very good actually. So let's talk\nabout connectors. The first connector I want to talk about is the quarter inch connector.\nThis would be also called an instrument cable or a guitar cable. Quarter inch, instrument,\nguitar cable. These are all synonymous with each other. So if someone says, hey, hand me that guitar\ncable or hand me that instrument cable. This is what they're talking about.\nSo the quarter inch cable just has two ends like this usually. And this is the male connector.",

      "coverage_text": "They're both male connectors. And we'll talk about that in a second. But they basically just one goes\nin your guitar, one goes in your pedal board or amp. There's a bunch of different applications for\nquarter inch cables. So this is what the quarter inch connector looks like. Now there is a male end and\nthe female end to just about any cable really. And this is the male end. And I'll let you decide\nwhy it's called the male end. I'm not going to go into that, but let me see. Where was the\nother one I was looking at? Oh, and then this is the female end there. And it's just basically\nthe male end goes into the female end. And so, you know, on your guitar, that's what this is going to be.\nThis is the female quarter inch connector or the jack. A lot of times people just say jack. If it's\nattached to something, it's usually called a jack. Then you just plug it in like that. So in theory,\nI could have the end of this cable could be a female connector and I could keep on connecting them\nand just making a big long chain. So this is the quarter inch connectors, the male and female\nquarter inch connectors. The next kind of cable is the XLR cable. And that is this right here.\nNow, XLR technically is just the designation for the cable end itself. But usually when someone says\nXLR cable, they're meaning give me a microphone cable or an audio cable with these connectors at\nthe end of it. So you can see here, this also has two ends to it. This is the female end because it's\ngot three holes there. And this is the male end. It's got three stems there and they connect together.\nAnd you can make audio cables like this. Microphone cables connect together and loop like that,\nwhich there's no purpose in that other than storing it maybe. But you can connect them,\ndaisy chaining them. And then on the back of your speaker or whatever, it's going to have one of these\nends that's going to plug into or your microphone. There's a lot of different uses for this on a mixing\ndesk. Most of the inputs are going to be XLR. If it's a pro mixing desk, sometimes you'll have quarter\ninch on the mixing desk as well. Usually those are your main connectors. Also, XLR cables can be\ndata cables used for DMX lights. And we'll talk about that in just a minute. Right now, we're going\nto talk about just the connectors themselves. The next connector that is not known as much on the lower\nend stuff, but a lot higher end pro audio gear has speak on connectors. And this is a speak on",

This is what the female end looks like. And they click in\nlike that. Now the great thing about speak on connectors is they lock into place until you pull\nthis back and you undo it. So basically they just go in like this, you twist them, it locks into place,\nand then you've got a very, very secure cable until you pull this back. So these are speak on connectors.\nIf you can use them for your speakers, these are great because you're not going to have anybody\ntripping over a cable and it unplugs. So if you're a DJ, maybe you're a mobile church setting up in a\nschool where people are walking around a lot, it's not a permanent situation. If you have the choice for\nspeak on, they're, they're very, very good. A lot of times too, you'll hear the word new tricks.\nSomeone will say, Hey, give me a new tricks cable or that new tricks connector. It actually isn't a\nnew tricks cable or new tricks connector. New tricks is a brand name. So it's kind of like Kleenex.\nSo, you know, if someone says, give me a Kleenex, they really, they're just saying, give me a tissue,\nbut Kleenex is synonymous with that. So sometimes if someone says, give me a new tricks connector,\nthey really mean speak on. And a lot of times you'll have a quarter inch to speak on adapter used as\nwell. If your speaker cabinet only has speak on connectors, but you only have quarter inch cables,\nthe next kind of connector we're going to talk about is the RCA cable. Now this one has a lot\nof different applications that you will see, not just in pro audio, but in home audio as well.\nAnd this is what the, the RCA connector looks like there. And you know, you'll see this a lot of times\nthe back of like a stereo system. There's just a lot of applications. The, the consumer world has\nreally embraced the RCA connector. But it's also has a lot of purposes in pro audio and in sound.",

      "coverage_text": "For example, a lot of times if you're doing anything stereo, if you're coming from a computer\nand you're hooking up into a mixing desk, a lot of times they'll have from your computer to a,\nlike one cable coming out of that, which we'll talk about in a second.\nAnd then it's making a Y connection to the mixing desk left and right. A lot of times the other end\nof these will say, we'll have like a red and a yellow. These are also used in video as well.\nThey're, they're pretty cool cable because they'll transmit a lot of different types of information,\nbut this is the, the RCA connector right here. So the connector itself is called RCA.\nThe next connector is a 3.5 millimeter connector or a eighth inch sometimes is what it's called.\nIt actually 3.5 is, is more accurate, but let me open this up here. You're probably very familiar\nwith this because this is the kind of connector that's going to be on your phone. So if you're,\nyou're plugging this in from an iPod or an iPhone into something else, this is going to be the connector.\nSo that, that little jack that's on everybody's phone, that is a, a 3.5 millimeter jack. Now I'm going to\nactually grab my headphones here. This is actually the headphones to my phone right here. And you can\nsee on this one, there's actually three white lines there. That's because this has a microphone hooked up\ninto this. There's actually three different signals happening left, right, and then the microphone.\nUsually though, in the, the pro audio world, you're going to see this connector right here, which is,\nit's got two lines here. This is a stereo connector, which means there's a left and a right. So this,\nthis has a stereo connector. Now this is the same type of thing. You're going to see a male in like\nthis and a female in. Also, before I move on too far, this is a quarter inch cable with a stereo\nconnector there, a left and right. So this actually has two cables in here, two signals going through",

It's\ngoing to transmit, uh, ones and zeros from a keyboard or an effects pedal, or there's a lot of applications.\nThis is definitely a pro audio cable here. So a lot of times in the back of, of, uh, of keyboards,\nyou'll see MIDI. Um, a lot of times keyboards are kind of moving away from MIDI and they're going to USB.\nSo a lot of your older keyboards are going to see MIDI instead of the USB. If you're hooking it up\nlike to a computer to record or something like that. So this is a MIDI cable and it produces or\ntransmits data.
