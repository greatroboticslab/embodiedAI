8:32 - this black man doesn't know what is vertically and what is horizontally. So his fallos according to his understanding is getting up vertically ahahah

Also check out this course too from the same channel

Thank you so much for the course! I am trying to make my 8x8 matrix to show sliding letters. I am terrible at programming, using: byte Slide[][8] = {}; with the code in {}, but getting this error: Compilation error: cannot convert 'byte (*)[8] {aka unsigned char (*)[8]}' to 'byte* {aka unsigned char*}' for argument '1' to 'void drawScreen(byte*)' Feeling a bit stuck

Just found this course I’m around 1h30 min. Quick question: since the program is in computer, can we get the same result of tricolor light if we connect arduino to another source?

right neooww

What is this?

Really everything was great. However, I could not understand the buttons' explanation

Like just for first ten minutes, continue watching futher...

Can we use any other arduino board because it is not available in my country

Can we use any other Arduino board

23:30 That innocent little insect you killed - No need to do that.

Thanks man , This course was awesome !

This is beautiful. In all my years of YouTube. This is the most comprehensive video in general. I am really excited to buy my setup.

10 hrs course for free🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯

23:30 RIP

continue from: 6:19:49

I cant find a 16x16 led matrix

how can I make my background Black??

what types of jobs can one apply for if i know all this Arduino?

What happen to DHT? hehehe

Yes you can

ebay

1:27:04  what about for 3volts

1:39:56 . ICL, i had no clue what a bod rate was untill i realised you meant byte :S

33:30 Can anyone please tell me how I can use my arduino Uno ?? 🥲🥲

23:34 🐜🪦

1:34:41

2:49:35

how did he connect the led in 2:05:40 without resistor i did connect it like him and my led got fused

"its what", "is it what", "do this what"

in 24:05 you said that the pencil is one of the materials that do not conduct electricity, but graphite actually conducts electricity.

intro sounded like it was made by ai

Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge. I was wondering on thing though...when working with the Potentiometer, you did not use a 330 ish OHM resister to protect the LED when connecting it to the breadboard through the 20 to 10K ( assumed values) pent. I thought it may destroy my LED and it did; but yours appeared to continue to work.  I ended up rebuilding the circuit and breadboard with a 330OHM resister in it and it appeared to work better and not blow up.  TBH, the only reason I could figure this out is because of the first couple hours of your Arduio Course.  really looking forward to finishing it.

So we are going to see a video about what? About Arduino.

I've been at it for 4.5 hours now and still going strong. I'll be back tomorrow. Thank you for this wonderful course!

12:30 Incorrect..... current flows from negative to positive

I'm a little surprised and honestly sceptical that you didn't consider the forward voltage of your LED in the very first circuit. Now obviously your resistor did it's job but wouldn't you have to use this equation to calculate the proper resistance for your led?  PowerSrc V - Fwd V LED = 15ma * R I'd love to see some clarification of this, thanks

Unbelievable.  I looked at coding these years ago and struggled to grasp it.  Fast forward to today....and yes...I haved couded probably 1000 hours in VBA (had to learn it for work and build a production schedule)....and i cannot believe how similar the layout is.  Your work here is SUPERB.  THANK YOU!

that is cool but... 10 HOURS?!?!?!?

I'm confused about the bread board: you say horizontally but you move you're probe vertically, then later you say vertically and move your probe horizontally. Or maybe because you're holding the breadboard turned 90 degrees? I don't know. Why wouldn't you just keep the vertical vertical? Regardless, I will bust out the multimeter and find out myself. I'm developing trust issues right off the bat. I'm going to keep watching, but my first thought is still how can I trust this guy?

boring

2 hours on, great stuff.

baud rate, in bits per second.

What do you want to do with it?

@gribbler1695  Use it like him

@gribbler1695  I want to set up my arduino uno to use it like him.

I'm two hours in and it's driving me crazy. Driving me what?

@PedroSilva-gb3gq  LOL!

Yes it's flipped 90 degrees. When you see the circuit connections, you'll understand easily. Like the LED comes after the resistor. So the connection of +ve of LED will be along the line of resistor in the middle parts. Hence for the middle parts, you are connecting horizontally with 5 slots available for it (along the breadth/smaller side of the breadboard). The 2 stripes on the border are vertically connected. So it will be the same connection along the longer side/length of the breadboard.

The best Arduino lesson on YouTube to date! 2.22.24

Thanks!

👍

AMAZING! The perfect tutorial. Thank you so much.

too basic

1:04:30

Amazing way of teaching. love from india

Yo bro you really think someone is going to sit for 10 hrs straight to watch this men you could had broke it down to at least 2 hrs segments  I knw if i wana learn i gota commit but we have to be realistic  Now i gota skip and make plan to watch a YouTube video

If you were to subtract every "ok", every "what" and every instant repeat of the same question/statement from this video it'd be les than half it's runtime. I appreciate the time and effort it took to put this together but damn it's hard to listen to without getting seriously annoyed.

Now again, again what dont we do?  We dont do drugs, and why  is that?  Its because, again, because, its again because everybody can tell, thats right.

🔥

Arduino made on a breadboard being FTDI PROGRAMMED is awesome.

this course seems to be 50% about the creators hands, like bruh, its 2024 lets get some high tech eductional tools

One of the best vidios in history ❤️❤️ thanks you so much sir

what.. to what... to the what.. what

Excellent.  Enjoyed every minute & will keep coming back for references.

No sir, before you continue teaching this course or begin teaching any other course you should work on your communication skills. If you would simply take the time and watch your video, you'll notice the amount of time you spent REPEATING YOURSELF and SAYING THINGS BACKWARDS,  It's infuriating. Taking the time to pause while speaking goes a very long way and allows those making the effort to learn, a chance to process. It's clear you are knowledgeable on the subject matter but your poor communication throughout this video is a huge obstacle! This course would be not only clearer but also shorter if your verbal communication and material organization were much more sorted!

3 hours in and I bought the kits. Really enjoy the full package(link for kits/video explains everything in order). With the kits its like I'm following along in a class. I'm trying to learn more about EE and coding so this couldn't more perfect to learn

top class work, thank you.

Best YT Channel ever ❤

You have to build circuits in this course. Do you want him to use some advanced surgical tools to build basic circuits?

@sachinshah4594  not necessarily, a powerpoint wouldnt hurt, marker and paper is a bit casual, although what do you expect from some hobby platform

just realizing now ...  I'm a first year CS student how in the hell I got here!

Honestly I’m treating myself and getting the kits. They are cheap

Hello where did you get the resistor measurement machine?

Great Content. Simply Great!! In Project #6, I may have missed the part about being careful of frying up your LED. Please be careful of the potentiometer, and not bring down the resistance all the way to 0 and avoid the mistake I did.

stop stealing other people's videos

Thanks for the course, which is a lot of fun. For the seven seg display:  I mean, the diode lets the current flow in one direction, but I don't really get why the diode is neccessary? I tried it and it also works without the diode.

his accent is impossible to understand

Wrong! Current flows from negative to positive.

38:50 1:14:52 2:13:19

This is the good part of the internet.

project#8 was funny 😂😂

10 hours of "what" Jk but this is hands down one of the best Arduino tutorials, thank you!

❤❤❤

imma take this course after cs50p and cs50x 2024

Just amazing best channel on coding. ❤

Why not simply divide V/I for resistance? You know the values for V and I. Much easier for a noob to grasp that simple formula of ohms law.

Hopefully in the future there will be a Freecodecamp platform courses based on Arduino simulators such as Wokwi and Flux Io

can you send me the code

Thank you!

Does the needed LED Matrix need to be common catode or is common anode ok too?

hehehe well so I did)

?

that is why subtitles are invented

?

Could you recommend any other arduino course after this?😅

@sixsidesofseven  I didn't continue building on the Arduino and went back to game development 😅 Do you have a Discord though? Maybe we can discuss.

Yeah

it's in the description.

Why learn this?

super amazing

Super simple! I love it!

Thanks for such course!  This is amazing!  😵‍💫😅😀👍

This guy is so good at teaching.  You should push him to keep making courses.

1:54:16

55:06

I spent 3 months learning electronics and how to build a 4 bit computer. Forgotten it all but it comes back fast.

how  can you write int readPin = A5; Integer can hold the number 5 but A5 is kind of a combination of "int" and "char". So how is that valid?

4:09

3:06

I am leaving a WHAT? That's right, a like and a comment. Thanks for the tutorial.

32:40

I have the mega my regular Arduino didn’t arrive yet

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ Love it

Muchas gracias for this

Thank you!!!!! This is the first course I' ve found that explains what each component is. I knew I was supposed to use resistors but didn't know why and now I get it 😊 I'm glad I finally found a true beginner course.

This is way more than paying it forward! Thank you very much for the absolutely wonderful portrayal of Humanity

You are a really good teacher Mathew, you explain everything very clear and easy to understand. Thank you for doing this!

this is the begineer part of comptuer engneering and you will specifically need it if you want to get into IoTs and robotics

@mathew2005  thanks

You know any tutorials on the code for arduino

I've been doing electronics for 45 years let me add my 2 cents worth  1. it's really cool that you're getting into electronics STICK WITH IT  2. My advice.... Electronics and I.T. and Technology has a funny way of complicating things... TRY TO SIMPLIFY EVERYTHING WHILE YOU LEARN ABOUT THINGS, if it makes sense in your head, it'll make sense later when everything integrates  3. Now.. this DOESN'T explain what EACH COMPONENT IS. there is so much more Logically, this is how you should learn electronics components  BASIC ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT  (Battery / Power source, Wire, Load / Resistor / Fan etc)  Now the components AS YOU PROGRESS LEARN WHAT EACH ONE IS  DO NOT SKIP OVER THEM LEARN TO TEST EACH ONE PROPERLY to do this Understand the purpose and job of each one  WIRE Learn about diameters, How it relates to resistance and conductivity. Test with , Resistance, Continuity Later with more experience, Voltage and Capacitance This is a connective component  FUSE Learn the difference between a wire and a fuse Test with Resistance and Continuity This is a protective component  RESISTOR Research different types of resistors Test with Resistance and for run, Test difference resistors with continuity  TO LEARN WHY NOT TO USE CONTINUITY ON RESISTORS AND FUSES FOR TESTING learn the limits of continuity testing and when it applies and when it does not  DIODE For starters do not worry about Zenner Diodes, First get a grip on  DIODES AND SHOTTKY DIODES once you have that, then progress to LIGHT EMITTING DIODES Test with Diode Mode The Take away here is... If you have a scope, Put 5V through a diode and pay attention  to the Vf (forward Voltage Drop)  NOW YOU UNDERSTAND SOME BASICS, GRADUATE TO THE OPPOSITES Capacitor vs inductor  CAPACITOR Start with Electrolytic and learn about the different types of Caps. Learn about POLARIZED AND NON POLARIZED DEVICES Do not test a capacitor with Capacitance mode LEARN ABOUT E.S.R. (Equivalent Series Resistance) The take away is a Capacitor Stores VOLTAGE  INDUCTOR Test with a component tester for the Henry value but you can use Resistance for the test to see if it's burned out or not the take away is.... THEY STORE CURRENT in a magnetic field  NOW LEARN ABOUT FARADAY'S LAW OF INDUCTION LEARN ABOUT TRANSFORMERS  TRANSFORMERS they are basically 2 inductors you're going to be testing voltage across the primary side then Voltage across the secondary side  OK, NOW WE GET A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED AND ENTER INTO SEMI CONDUCTORS  so now we go into   BRIDGE RECTIFIERS Learn about Half wave rectification, Full Wave Rectification, Pulsated DC and DC and AC  then..... TRANSISTORS  then MOSFETS  This will cover most of what you will encounter  NOW YOU ENTER THIS WORLD INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (I.C.'s)   which is what gets you to Arduino  Learn about  MICRO CONTROLLER vs MICRO PROCESSOR  Definitely Look into ESP32 as it is far superior to Arduino and not much more difficult to program  Also.... if you're interested in fixing things DEFINITELY LEARN ABOUT   SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supplies)   that is what a list of all basic components looks like.   THIS IS A GOOD COURSE NO DOUBT Now let me start anew post

@martinkuliza  thank you for taking time to write all this valuable information ☺️

@MiauMichigan  You're Welcome if you have any questions, Feel free to ask

@martinkuliza  Thanks my friend.

@IamFlamey   You're Welcome, Glad i could help

@martinkuliza bro can you recommend any other arduino course after thsi

Mainly focused on coding

Does connecting a 100k ohm resistor damage the 7 segment display ? 😅

Thanks once again for another wonderful course ❤ Please can a course be done on robotics with Arduino Thanks

Entire year of Electronics course in one video :-P Good job!

for the blink project i followed along exactly, but im not getting any results led wont power on. works on the previous example

You answered all of my questions in my head.Thank you a lot sir.

1023 = 5v in binary

i have a problem with my board, the delay(1000) takes like 4 seconds instead of 1, same when i used millis() does anyone know whats goin on?

It's a wonderful course for a beginner! I had already done some Arduino before but now I can make many projects. I highly recommend the course !

No but it will not light up as a 5V wont flow current

You need to change the jumper from 5V to a digital pin (on the opposite side of the arduino) then  in the pinMode use your pin number (not the one in the video unless you also used #7)

@MiauMichigan  thank you!

AC is not "alternative current" @2:17:59. AC is alternating current.

Been looking for this! ❤

When you say what I feel like I watch Dora the explorer

Deberían ofrecer un curso de electrónica digital

One word respect

2:38:22 you have the file right in front of you.. just create a file called pitches.h (with notepad its fine), and copy those 93 lines of code, just a bunch of #define to define all pitches, there... and place it in the library folder

2:17:34 let me correct you  You are wrong again, it is NOT AC current for the passive buzzer, it is a flickering/pulsating DC current (turning ON and OFF, it is NOT not same as alternating)!  AC means that the voltage/current changes polarity.  A PWM signal typically is a logic signal that turns on and off.  So, a PWM signal is more accurately described as a pulsed DC signal.  It is neither AC nor DC, but it is closer to being DC in waveform, the electricity flow is always going the same direction, it just turns on and off (pulsating).  If you set it to 255 it's like a normal 5V DC, but if you set it to 0 Volts, so it's like no current.  Anywhere between only changes how long the pulses are on/off. (e.g. 127 -128 will result a 50-50 pulse of 5V and 0V resulting an average 2.5V but NOT AC).

at 2:08:00 shouldn't you put a little 330 / 220 resistor between the pot meter and the led? if you turn the knob fully to that 0 resistance , won't that 5V fry the LED  ?

Hi  Steve job

14:25

תודה!

Similar course on raspberry pi

one thing most individuals will quickly recognize, is that whatever Arduino kit you purchase, the resistors provided ARE ALL COLOR BASED IN BLUE! As if the Chinese that made them only had blue pigment available for potting the base filler material. Probably not important, but does screw with the minds of those who grew up learning electronics. At then it was a beige light brownish color. Just saying.

Awesome!

Great video, thanks a million!

I believe you have your horizontal and vertical backwards 🤔 Maybe I'm wrong 🤷‍♂️

Can you also make same 10 to 20 hours long course for ethical hacking and networking (how does internet works how does encryption works, hacking tools, how to hack or test security of home wifi router and other ethical hacking and network testing plzzzz)

Hi have an arduino uno and I have connections to PCA9685 16 channel servo driver board I can't get the code to run using example code sweep I added adafruit pwm code I think it would load up . Any help if you reply your be the first I've on forums you post no has relayed hell please  as like make moving skull

i love you for this course

Thanks!

If a voltage is varying from say 5v back to 0V, back to 5v back to 0v, then it is ALTERNATING between 0 and 5 volts. Is this not correct? t's not steady voltage. It's ALTERNATING. So what about a pulsing voltage that alternates between 0 and 5 volts makes it not alternating. All you say is that it's not correct w/o explaining why...when it sounds exactly like it's alternating.

amazing video! I've been looking for something like that for over a week!

23:36 Insect appeared 23:34 Gave strike  23:36 SMASHED IT  R.I.P  Pandemic came after he ate food with those hands 🤣🤣

Never underestimate

56:34 Homework // C++ code // void setup() {   pinMode(5, OUTPUT);   pinMode(6, OUTPUT);   pinMode(7, OUTPUT); }  void loop() {   digitalWrite(5, HIGH);   digitalWrite(6, LOW);   digitalWrite(7, LOW);   delay(5000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)   digitalWrite(6, HIGH);   digitalWrite(7, LOW);   digitalWrite(5, LOW);     delay(2000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)   digitalWrite(7, HIGH);   digitalWrite(5, LOW);   digitalWrite(6, LOW);       delay(5000); }

holy I’ve always wanted a tutorial on this lol

thanks for the content... a couple of feedbacks (am 3 hours  and something in): some sections a bit rushed and not quite to the point i.e. how to interpret the pushbuttons and use them as actual switches... also it seems you keep connecting the sensors to the input device pins (potentiometers, pushbuttons) rather than controlling the sensors form different pins using the values from the outputs which to me is a more elegant solution...  It would have been nice to see a quick recap with the simulator if possible... I have a microcontroller but got lazy and preferred using the software... Also the explanation why the DHT uses digitalread is not clear in my opinion. How then the sensor can i fact send temperature and umitidiy values which are not binary more efficiently then as analog? Ok probably the library takes care of it but what is the advantage if any?

please trim your nails, don't take it negative, if possible shoot the video again and upload once more. it is informative and helpful for sure.

That thumbnail was AI generated

6:02:12 javascript laughing in the corner

one more video before I sleep   the video in question

Can I use arduino coding kit? The rest are too expensive for me

This is such a great resource.  I’m sorry to complain but why do you repeat yourself so much 8:58

This is really good for us beginners. I watch a little bit everyday. In future videos-- make them short videos in series. That would help when re-watching a section for better understanding. Overall, I love it.

Sir please make one video on java just like c++

You are doing God work ❤❤❤

would be nice a esp32 course

Project#8: For people wondering how to import the pitches.h: - Explanation is right after the code source of the Melody Tune of "Play a Melody using the tone()" page. :)

Can you make a video on IIOT or MES ?

void loop(){         useWhatWord(100); }

You can check the built-in chapter fuctionality to rewatch a section 😊

@MiauMichigan  -- I'm an idiot!! lol I didn't scroll down far enough. Thanks

Project#9: DHT Sensor The code in the video didn't work. I rewrote it here  ``` #include <DHT.h> #include <DHT_U.h>  #define DHTTYPE DHT11 #define DHTPIN 13  float tempC;  DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);  void setup() {   Serial.begin(9600);   dht.begin(); }  void loop() {   // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:   tempC = dht.readTemperature();   Serial.print("tempC: ");   Serial.println(tempC);   delay(1000); } ```

Much thanks

the microcenter link does not work

The thumbnail has components that dont exist snd it looks ai generated lol😊

sir please be kind enough to do a video series about pic assembly programming , pic micro python programming , pic basic programming , pic c programming with pic 16 , 18 , 22  ........ etc . thank u for the video sir

Awesome❤❤❤

Thank you so much

This is a really great course with one tiny constructive criticism: in future videos, please avoid repeating any word in such excessive frequency as you use "what?" so often that it becomes extremely redundant, disruptive, distracting, and generally difficult to watch.

20:38  Resisitors have tolerance, the percentage of error (+/- resistance)

My guy was wondering why "let" doesn't work while programming in Arduino IDE 😭😭😭

Amazing. Now a course about raspberry pi and esp32 please.

Good information

Welcome to the world of IIOT 😍

bookmark : 1:19:48

Hope that freecodecamp can do a video on STM32 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

Can I use Arduino Uno R3 kit for the tutorial

It's over 80 degree F in his place, and he is wearing a sweater???

Please enable in the settings the ability to translate your video into another language using AI, if possible. In the Yandex browser, your video is not translated into Russian, but some are translated. Thanks!

Awesome!  Want to say thanks. I would love to also see this in raw/standalone C (not the Arduino interpreted/bootloader) and TinyGo.   (But to be clear, I'm not requesting FCC do this... but if anyone stumbles across the same tutorial in those "bare metal" languages, and remembers my post, please post the links here.. thanks!)

The constant questions are annoying, the repeating of them is aggravating.

Hell YEAAHHH!!! THANK YOU FCC

Please can you Create a Tutorial video on Arduino Uno, this is because most people can afford this and it is better for beginners. Love the Tutorial by the way

I was looking for this comment 😅

Yes. I've just started working on this with my brother. He got that kit as a gift and works like a charm 😊

a big thank you to the creator of this interesting course. Much compliments on your job

23:33 Rip 🙏 Insect-San, You'll remain in our hearts ❤🙏 One Like = One Pray for the little thing 🙏 👼

Please make a course on robotics or mechatronics something like that with projects.

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Shh  lot of things to learn !!

Please do a raspberry pi tutorial next

💚💚

muy buen curso 😊

1:16:40

In the resistors section, you say amps instead of ohms.

Um, On your multimeter, I think you want to connect the black to com, and  red to the v hz.

I have been donating 5 dollars every month since Las year.   How can I access the course?

Another course on Raspberry pi will also be great

great video, thx i really like the video, not skipping when it's not working and showing how you solve it etc  thx.

Amazing course! Loved the fact that everything was being covered here!

Perfect and Awsome!!! Sir

1:34:41

I wish it includes ideas for projects to build with adruino

I'm at 25" and already impressed by how well Mathew is introducing the components and the prerequisites for this course. I will surely try to complete the course within a week. Thank you Mathew for your effort and FreeCodeCamp for your support.

i really need something like this on stm32

very sad moment in this course :(

not finish yet, but great video so far, thx 6:12:12

Amazing  video

5:06:00 Why is he not using resistors for the LED? I don't understand...

We need more videos on embedded systems especially on stm32 and Raspberry Pi 4. Please...🥺

Thank you @mathew2005 , this is a great course!

Amamzing course on arduino that I was looking for.  Can you guys make complete Java GUI tutorial that would be amazing! Thanks.

Now please make a course on how make 3d printer from scratch

English is not good and the base level is too high...and as an intermediate Arduino programmer you advance into deep topics too early, but your effort is appreciated.

Could you please create a video about how to make basic HTTp requests with Arduino?

Turkish subtitles please🙏

Make video about uber app

Please share a complete course of x86 assembly programming. It would be a great help for me and my friends.

Valeu!

now i feel less fulfilled leaving computer eng for software eng

guys, should i watch this arduino course or the one from 2 years ago that is 4 hours? i watched 1 hour from the one 2 years ago but found this was uploaded yesterday, what should i do

I was waiting for YEARS FOR THIS THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

Thx cool this video. Guy thisll, spRk my inspiration . -ggv - gt yes. ..

New subscriber always watching your videos thank you for sharing knowledge😊❤

Great video as always :D It would be awsome if you could make a tutorial for Solidworks, Catia V5, or any other 3D modeling program.

Take a shot whenever he says "what"

3hr. 35 miniutes. .. tyaok ...

:face-red-heart-shape: these courses are needed to be preserved in ice vaults for the future ages.

Please make a full react 18 course

This couldn't have come at a better time, was just about to finish the first 4-hour course and really enjoying it. I thought to get this little sucker as a "toy", but man... This thing is addictive

Excited, to watch ur vid. Stime ago, I experimented with A.. Bought a box with everything. Not bad, a bit boring....

I ain't gonna lie. You sound truly like Marques Brownlee (MKBHD) 😂😂

the audio and video are out of sync after around 20 mins mark.

My wife caught be playing with my arduino, and she is a computer engineer, so she helped me play with my arduino. This is a serious story about arduino

I really needed this course. Thank you for the upload.

Great course!  I'll ditto the request for the Raspberry Pi course!

A similar course on raspberry pi would be fantastic! Thanks. This channel is such a good thing for the world. Empowering anyone with an internet connection to gain skills in Stem.

You've done an excellent job! Keep progressing with the development of intermediate and advanced level Arduino courses.

No way. These videos come at the perfect times!! I literally just bought my first microcontroller yesterday🤯

Hello! Does anyone know what alternative website I can use for buying the same exact arduino kit in australia

Thank you for providing this free and detailed course for everybody to enjoy!

I initially thought a boat migrant was talking about a charity YouTube advert 🤣

hand-made nuclear reactor, I am going!

Literally best channel for learning Advanced IT

Fcc has been reading my mind lately

Can you do with ESP32 or STM32?

I wish this video was released 6 yrs ago...

What you and your wife do with your arduino isn't our business and never will be.

These things are mostly about programming. Nobody uses them in industry. Programming fundamentals are the focus.

Your right, but this can be a good hobby. @deker0954

I'd love something for ESP32 too

Wow bud you are jumping all over the place and making tons of mistakes. You’re teaching others?

When is this happening?

You can buy the amazon one but the inland is unfortunately not available outside the US. I am using the inland one because someone gave it to me as a gift a year ago but the eleego has way more components

@mathew2005  thank you!

Woaaah..Finally 🎉🎉🎉

❤❤❤

I am about to continue with my engineering journey and this is extremely helpful! Please continue making arduino/tinkering kit courses for us aspiring folks!

Can an ESP32 be used instead in this tutorial? Are there any relevant changes?

Y'all reading my mind ??! always uploading tutos whenever i need one xD also would love to have a node red tuto ♥

Really timely

This is great! Any plans to do a Raspberry Pi course like this too?

Awesome!!! I used to want to be an embedded developer. But now, I'm frontend developer. Even though, I still wish to be an embedded developer (I still config neovim just to dream that I will program microcontroller with neovim :))). This course can help me reach to that dream a little bit, thanks freecodecamp and mathew2005!!!

Nice way for all future ❤ thanks friends for tutorial

😊 I hope you enjoy the course! I want to thank freecodecamp and everybody for the support. Anyways, if you have any ideas for future courses, let me know in the comments.

Any plans to have this in Spanish too?

On time 3:00, the parts list shows a 16X16 LED Matrix. I think you meant 8X8,

It's about time! Thank you!

Arduino made on a breadboard being FTDI PROGRAMMED is awesome.

I love this❤. Not quite sure if E and F are connected though🤔

This is humanity at it finest. I will pay my gratitude in the future by providing open source knowledge to all.

needed this course the most now .. wow

Finally Arduino projects 💘

much needed & appreciated thank u

Chat GPT is very helpful for Arduino

😭three years ago when I was 13 years old I was playing with raspberry Pi and Arduino(mainly UNO). The only source from which I can learn about these things were websites.  I searched  a lot for the courses in the YouTube but I didn't found any😢. Now I am preparing for JEE to go to Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) so I  don't have time to learn this.

As an Engineer My advice, Jump over to the ESP32 you can run all Arduino programs on ESP32 however you can also use FREE RTOS Operating system you have 2 cores You have more memory on the stack AND , IT'S CHEAPER it's far superior that you'd be crazy not to do it as an engineer

@meenapandey1473  This is a late reply but maybe watch the video for at least 30minutes-1 hour every day. Set yourself SMART goals and watch YouTube videos where it teaches time management when your busy.

@meenapandey1473  What a tremendous student

Thanks Mathew it really help  Please make one more video of Arduino with more projects with  more different components such as how to use gsm ,relay , etc  will be waiting for next part And also make same video on rasberrypi too

Thank you for the course!

Nice body Mathew

Can you make a cource on pcb

This was an amazing video. I learned so much about arduino. this video may have changed my life. Thank you on so much next time I would enjoy more projects it would be so amazing.

Any prerequisites?

everything is ok but why you killed insect human rights will catch you for poaching lol

Thanks Matthew for explaining the fundamentals right from the beginning! Your teaching is a gift to all of us!

nice starting course for people interested in Arduino. Keep it up bro!

Thank you so much for the course. I like your teaching style.

Thanks for sharing!  Great course and of course it is enjoyable to learn something new everyday!

Thank you!

I didn't see the part on the switch where you showed us how to debounce it

Yep my bad

Lol

Dude, this stuff is awesome! I don't even have one of these boards but now I want to go out and get a kit just because I found this video.

@magetaaaaaa me too!

MCUs are greats electronics components to use any project!!! It''s a great tutorail, I'll learn many thinks here!!

Wow, yesterday I was looking at my arduino kit, and now this!  THANK YOU.

Finally my wait is over i need that ❤

❤

I am lucky today i started to learn embedded last 3 days I am finding sources just i think the morning I need best sources I got on evening.❤

What if I don't have the equipments?

Make a video on devops

I wish this existed 2 years ago… still, better late than never!

I wish I had these during college days

I was just thinking to learn Arduino and you posted it.  Thank You FreeCodeCamp  You're the Best!

❤

Thanks it will really help❤

Please sir make a detail video or complete course on CRM... very in-demand skill so i request for it.

Really needed course 😊😊

Pleas this vedio hindi dub sir🙏

It looks like you're reading my mind. I'm just thinking of learning Arduino😅  Thank you so much This will be helpful

👌 👍

Worth it ❤🎉

FREE CODE CAMP = MOST POWERFUL HARDWARE PROCESSOR OF THE COMPUTER TUTORIAL WORLD.

Thanks 🎉

There is a section where I show you how to use a digital arduino (03:02) you can follow along using it

Paul McWhorter has a wonderful collection of related courses if you wish to continue learning.

@jstro-hobbytech  oh yea I watched those a bunch, it’s just pacing of the videos that threw me off

What is the value of learning this, I mean scope in industries by learning this course?bro

@msdh1139  it’s good for in general learning programming, but also really good in comp sci, compE, electronics, electrical engineering, and lots of other tech fields like robotics and such. it is really fun once used to it!

@msdh1139  you can have a better understanding for embedded systems and have a goot hold to learn more.  I leaned nothing but I thought it was a cool course. I've been messing with electronics and such for years. A digital multimeter would've helped explain. But he did great. FYI: if you expect to become a backend systems programmer by watching videos. Save your time and read then practice. The fact you had to ask shows your lack of ambition in learning so find something else you like. That's the great thing about life. Choice. Please don't take this as an insult.

You and 8.57 Million other people.

@meenapandey1473 😅 1:12 u  i

​​​ @meenapandey1473 I am also a jee aspirant. I have also kind of temporarily stopped working in this maker field Don't worry we'll do all these in engineering .

@pointofinterest5981  to bhai mai to CSE jaaunga to mujhe Arduino sikhne ko milega?

@meenapandey1473  I don't think so. Primary you will get it in electronics engineering. Even if you get it in cse, it will not be much used.

@meenapandey1473  bhai Arduino kuch bhi nahi hai, isse age badhkar aur bhi bohot kuch hai. Tumhe khud ka pcb design karna aana chaiye, (custom pcb for your project)

@pointofinterest5981 chalo pehle nikal to lun😂 dhanyavad 🙏

​ @meenapandey1473 💯

​ @pointofinterest5981 Bro is se aage aur kya hai kuch idea do ge ???

​ @meenapandey1473 All the best...

titan u know

@meenapandey1473  hey bro :hand-pink-waving:Can you tell me why you spend time learning English instead of spending all your time on technical research and exam preparation? Is English in your country almost mandatory?

​ @meenapandey1473 hey which class you are in

@pranshu2op  12th

@HaiNamTang  Yes

@meenapandey1473  you are like me but i did programming       Lets use both knowledge and make iot lol 😆

@meenapandey1473  no ardruino in cse

@pranshu2op  I know school level C,Java and python .

What a long course

First like❤
