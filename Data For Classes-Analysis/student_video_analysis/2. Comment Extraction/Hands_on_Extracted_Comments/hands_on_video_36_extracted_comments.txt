Hello, the introduction of the video is a stop motion, I like art and animation, that's why I did it, I do not want to imply that this is the final result, it's just the introduction of this, (stop motion 0:0, construction 0:22, end result 12:52) only if you plan to recreate what is shown in the video, read the full description to see the recommendations, otherwise, enjoy!

You can make

💩💩💩💩💩💩

Why is it so much different from the intro you scammed me!!!😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡

so the spider at the beginning and the spider at the end are not the same. i feel baited.

Thats a cool radio control spider i know theorical physics so i can already imagine what its like to make my own after all Einstein was also a theorical physicist and he said himself that imagination is more important than knowledge.

Tha machinery which you have used to made their names plz.

Art ✌️✌️

grr why didnt you make a giant spider mech!!! clickbait!!!

NO SE MUEVEN LAS PATITAS>:(

To move the arms independently we can use the mechanism used in wipers of cars and the stand fans. The only difference is we have to make the 2 sets arms separately.

It's very simple it's not a spidy robot man you are stuped

can you tell the names of the part please

what is the metal thing use for the spider leg?

❤ ❤

Rly nice model, even if the method of movement itself is a bit disappointing.  Why does your remote have an antenna, if it is wired? XD

The biggest lie in my life

El videos es español pendejos

Ma cosa cazzo combini video assolutamente deludente rispetto alle aspettative il ragno è uscito completamente diverso da quello che fai vedere all'inizio, all'inizio c'è anche un sedere fatto con la carta di alluminio e tutte le zampe si muovono invece quello finale non ha il sedere è fatto in modo diverso e le zampe non si muovono ma che schifezza di video hai fatto ? Hai preso per il culo per tutto il video

What is the thing that you put on the painted wood?  (The black painted wood)

As a person with arachnophobia if I saw that next to me on the bed end it was painted with actual colors of any spider and someone was cranking me with that I would $|-|!|— myself

I'd I saw that in my house I would burn that spider and move into a different house

I'm terrified of any spider bigger than my thumb. And there's a remote control tarantula toy in my attic, I don't know where I put it and finding it would not be a preferable situation

✨✨✨✨

nice

so it moves by vibration.

This is a vibration device. Is not a spider robot. So your video its actually a clickbait. The spider has no movement in his legs. Its just a metalic case with spider design, but without any mechanical movement. Only a vibration device. A similar device that was used by your mom to become pregnant with a child with passion in vibrations. And this is the result. 5 million people have been watching a failed project. Next time you can play with piezo discs if you don't want to learn mechanics and micro motors

:yougotthis:

EA wants to hire you - call them, dude.

It's true 😂😂 I watched full video with consistency...and you.......... 😂😂😂😂

I like spider ❤

The only problem stands in such scientific creations is (Power source) Unfortunately   If the world expanded to discover new power sources Iron man suit would of been real and used in military by now

Downvoted. idiot

is not,remote control,,i mean wireles,,but thanks for the video,,

13:10 in the bathroom 😂😂

12:45 I was scared

wait, so how does it move? (I already knew the legs weren't going to move, that requires programing and intelligent leg movement) I just skimmed it and all  I see is... that it vibrates to move? how, how does that work, I thought inertial propulsion wasn't possible, locomotion maybe but that's because of friction. So how is the friction working the way he wanted when the weights were just spinning in circles not really directing anything anywhere?

Hermoso

ART= 100% TECH=05%

I think there's a way you could make the legs move individually, using the 2 motors facing sideways. Use some sort of curved track and the motor crawls through the track making the legs apparently move.

How big is his brain 🧠🧠🧠

its just clickbait, sorry guys

I feel cheated 😥😃😉😋

WTF??

Tanto trabajo para que para que se mueva tensa ..

Wow if I were you I would paint like red back to scare people

Click bait.

For some reason i feel click bated......😔  Tho its pretty good

Saddly, this is another clickbait. At least the beginning of video is a clickbait.

👏👏👏🙋‍♂️

Did you make that

i will make it

Y los materiales ?

wajjajaja mula

idk, maybe this isn't real?      nope, the weights act like tank treads, spin one it turns in the opposite direction its using one of newtons laws, eveery action has a equal and oposite reaction

also i think there might be an easy-ish way to make a real one, replace the legs with tubes connected with some flexible material but have a more rigid "spine", fasten strings inside the tubes and connect the connecting tube to a motor and the string to a motor further back, program the legs to pull the strings to life the legs and move the motors, program tank steering,  realise you messed up the steering, redo the programing, and done

Hay

Great cwessten

i subscirbe

Para eso mejor le amarro un hilo y la jalo jaja

Mínimo que mueva una pata jaja

Wow, its totally amazing craft. The spider move through it viration. What a brilliant idea. I am new here..

Wow Man , are you Tesla to Robotic's ? ........ 👽👍

Wow!

Músic?

A metal remote would have been cooler

That's impressive

Show  something that we can afford

Did aluminium suddenly became a conductor of electricity

this is one of the neetest things ive ever seen, thanks.

Simple and smart!

13:22  Lmao

oh NO!!!!

I bet u spent thousands for it

Iron Spider : (vibrating and making sound) "Buuzzzz... Buzzzz.... Buzzzzz..."  Spiderman : "Oh, Come on... Are You Kidding me??? Just Shake It Off...!!"  This Guy : " . . . . . . " (Suddenly Freeze, and turn the remote Off...)

Plot twist: The spider is a real spider

Spiders are very 🤪🤮😫🤢

Nada que ver con el vídeo del intro.

Eselente

En la descripción dice que la introducción es stop motion

Здесь есть русские?

what type of wire is the one you use for the spider's legs

how much would i say to do that

The spider foot is useless 😸

The clickbait sucks but gotta give credit to the stop animation skills.

Thats very god and porfeckt videom! Thanks

Good for pranking friend

Clickbaited

Can you remake this but with legs that move like in the introduction

real : How to make clickbait robot (dislike).

I think people are watching T.V. to much... they think a robot is something like an android or kind of...  This mini spider is a contorlled robot just with a non common known way of locomotion.. there are many way to create force for locomotion.. just watch worms or snakes..  Nice video..

My dad created a big one and realistic

Nice video

I feel like I wasted my time. 😏 that's good for a massage 🤣

"My sister just shot me in my leg" HOPE YOU GOT WHAT I DID

One look does not even resemble the one at the beginning, misleading propaganda. ,,

I suppose this would be a fun project for a child. Perhaps you should state in the title that it is wired though.... technically it is still rc so ill give you that

Hey will you send me the spider my name is hate them just

Fuck off man, yes it's creative to show a stop motion clip at the beginning but holy shit that was click baity, I wasted my time there only to find out that that wasn't the final product, good stop motion though, I do stop motion as well and you could be looking at a career here

que buen  diseñador  de la araña 🕷 mi amigo

CLICK BAIT GOT ME!  Block channel

Nice. Video

Bhai aap to genius ka bhe bap ho 🤘🤘🤘🤘😎😎

Ummm nice arms

Well at least we can prank our friends now

que trabalheira homem de deus, vai arrumar o que fazer

I thought you where making the spider in the beginning where the legs move and its awesome. But you made the spider from the end where the legs don't even move. :( Also what's the purpose of the antenna if its radio controlled?

Hola si me pudieran dar el nombre de los materiales que se utilizan se los agradecería mucho

13:02 Ahahah /W@t da Pak/

donde puedo conseguir esas cositas que pusiste en el tórax de la araña?

The miserable is a genius!

After the quite convincing stop-motion-clip, the construction part is to long and the result is just disappointing. The spider itself looks accurate. The expectations are to high allthough you did a good job.

Amazing spider man haha  Nice keep it up

I thought it would crawl......

Garbage

Dude i thought you were gonna code and thats why i wanted to see how code could like send pulse into real life objects but this is gay

i like it,,,my friends,,,verry nice

shut up

thanks

No One has this stuff

How are the legs going to move

Esta  mamadisimo

My dream everytime i sleep. i wish i can make thausands of flies bomb.😅

Click bait bs

Me siento estafado

But the legs didn't actually move like in the beginning of the  video ..but creative👍

Expectation!     vs Reality....

What waste of time watching your gay video. The title should be "How to Deceive People that I made a Spider Robot using Stop Motion Animation Intro". That would be great!

0:00 the expectation    13:00 the reality 😑😑

Hello guys. I need the help of any person  I'm completely lost.  I need you all passing by this comment to give me video resources that teach mechanics and model assemply (art/motion) that discuss how to select the glue, what kind of tools that only bend iron and others that can't bend but only cut, and what kind of cable is suitable for what kind of device to be created. And the typical way of constructing a machine that can fit into X, Y, Z type of motions..  I need to start learning these stuff that i had always fell in love with ever since i was a child

Alt title: "how to make all the neighbors in your apartment block hate you"

To make the joints they would have to be microscopic or damn near it instead of being unimpressed I must say he did show how to make a spider so not a complete bust

I just love how the leg fell off 😆

My reaction : 😂😂😂😂 yes it was cool

Disappointment. 💣

Awesome

The problem is the misleading stop motion at the beginning

I agree 💯 we're lucky to see how this work of art was made ❤️

May be a iphone guy,   needs that much security

Tooth Fairy 😂😂😂 F

Idiota

such a waste of time......

i EXPECTED THE LEGS TO MOVE..........LIKE AN ACTUAL SPIDER...NOT A PARALYZED SPIDER.

👍👍I like it 🙃🙃

Unfortunately, it's no for me, the end completely destroyed my expectations, very, very disappointing presentation...get off my.. stage...

Oh damn. How words decieves us

Who else notice the intentional blur on his finger🤣🤣

Hello, where do you get the items? Are they usually in any hardware store like Ace or Home Depot?  Thank you.

what kind glue are uh using

I came to suppose that the spider could move its legs baaah.

Bodoh

Quem  viu as pilhas do Carrefour, um mercado brasileiro conhecido aqui?

firstly is a clickbait and the beginning feels misleading too to be honest

You should have made a car...

What the hell did I just watch? I can do that by putting my phone in "Vibration" mode then put it on the floor.

ok, it's a nice idea (fine welding, nice look), but robot? And: waste time - sorry

here we go again!!! its a trap!

What a dissapointment in the end...

I guess the antenna is strictly cosmetic?

Hahahahaha

That is so cool.

Fui tapeado!!!

Лайк не смотря!👍😎

We can now make a Robot Spider companion of you feel lonely  Just add some things that can cling into clothes in the legs and add a device that follows the Bluetooth signal and add moveable legs

Vibrator?

Membazir mase..bodoh sial

What the f**k! The legs don't move? I watched the whole video thinking the legs would move. You could pull the spider with a piece of string, it would look the same.

👍⚘

This was a complete waist of time

Suck

Spoon butt! Cute idea for it 🕷

Materials?

He didn't waste all your time. You did it on to yourselves. Hahaha You can tell the first 5 seconds of the video that it's just a stop motion, second don't expect something advance robotic here, 3rd y'all could've fast forward it, 4th he's not that high tier inventor but he's cool and just enjoying stuff. Y'all need to stop hating y'all can't even make one of these. And if you do then go upload some videos on your own. ✌️😁

Nice and cool keep it up I'm sure I can add a python algorithm to my rasberry to make movement maybe but great engineering

i can't believe i wasted my time on this, scammer

tanginamo remo

Don't see much movement, from that Spider xD

Sculpture would be a more accurate description.

It’s loud af though

Put a camera and a mic on that thing you could be a fly on the wall so to speak

Shit bois we got scammed

This is shit

So you basically made a metal spider and leashed it like a s*x slave....

This was such a flop

Click bait

You video description in other words.... click bait

Buen trabajo.

U fooled us with moving legs of spider . So u deserve dislike 👎

What is the thickness of copper wire????

Time for pranks hehehe ( evil laugh ).😈😈😈😈😈😈

You should name the things dat you are using as (It's just a useless piece of shit) auuh you wasted my time

Very good next time put some pointed teeth that sprays poison or taser for defense.

С виду конечно прикольно, но лучше бы было если бы он лапками переберал для движения. Я квк раз хочу такого, только не знаю где узнать механику для лап паука

I'm surprised people didn't now that the beginning is stop motion read the description also cool video I hate it when people misunderstand stuff

Extremely anticlimactic! The only animation is improvised via stop action. Don't waste your time watching this video, unless you are stoned and what to be mesmerized by b.s. minutiae!

The title should be "How to waste 13:37 minutes of your life."

Kid:"daddy there was a spider on the table please kill it!. After 2 minutes Kid:"oh it's okay dad turns out it was just another of your failed works.".

Yo pensé que movería las patas!

al principio la araña camina mueve las patas, y al final solo vibra que decepcion

Boli sme scammed, scammed

Cuanto me venderías una yo te la compro $$$$$$$

sería un robot si tendría más movilidad este sólo vibra y ya, solo es un interruptor de una araña vibrante

If it just a robot, that thing still make me scare, lmao

You put a wire on a spider how can I pasr my computer subject

asking the spider to move leg by leg would be asking a lot ... I was cheated.  It's a VIBRANT spider, not a robot.

Too much grieve I'd rather just buy one!

Dude Ur moron to call it's a robot

Me siento timado

So that the spider by remote ! Not the spider can be controling by wireless remote !

Хуйня, диз!

Omg what was the point if its legs dont move individually?

u just needed to add remote control with wire on title

Fuck that spider

your a pro at this and I love it😂💖👍

It wouldn't move the first part was stop motion

When you realize that the remote controller has an antenna even when it is wired...

Niat betul...

I was really expecting like the legs would more with it or aleast make it look like it was moving.  Whatever I still think it cool this guy may a mini mechanical spider with a 2 button remote and he knew how to aleast put it together and Hey Better then me.

I want to buy it because im 13 yesrs old and i dont have all of that

you guys you dont need to get all this stuff just for it to vibrate across the floor you can just get this for 8 bux online no need for this unnecessary junk

Technically it's a remote control Cause it run using remote

how did u make a remote control spider plz tell me

Once he soldered the legs together I  just laughed n said to myself... Click bait... Then I skipped to the end to discover I was correct.

Mortis Haz una araña violín

fui trolado, achei que seria sem fio o controle

Super glad I skipped to the end.

Nice vid tho. Now im searching on how to recover my wasted time watching misleading videos or how to punch somebody through the video.

Who else watches these but realised that your to lazy to do it

😑

You used stop motion.

Yes my child we are in the future this is the year 2179..   Remote control, mechanical spiders that don't move there legs, A cooler of ice for food, instead of square doors rounded doors, protection bro f*** guns we have clubs, all and gaming bro mm we at 8-BIT! bro that alot power, muggings happened pretty fast nowadays, music kind of sucks now, but that what happens when WW3 hits.

I feel like I didn't waste my time at the same time I did.

Хуита, в начале ваще не тот паук что делают

Go animations instead.. your far cool doing that, than making that junk

Achei que seria a mesma aranha do começo do video, mais nao foi  😔😔😔😔😔

\(●△●)/ すごいです！ 蜘蛛かっこいいです！！

Another video how to do a mechanic dick

ARDERÁS EN EL INFIERNO POR ESTA OSADÍA! aaaaaaaarggg

Reported, it's a remote controlled sculpture, there's no spider robot. It's like to put the same motor at a pickles and state it is a robot pickles. Nice mass publicity, just give up robotics and do only stop motion. Goodjob with the stop motion.

👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

Not... exactly what I was expecting.. I was hoping something more like the spider from the beginning

Help

Меня бы мамка за ложки отхерачила!

You're like an engineer ricer.

Whats its purpose useless

Tá aqui o comentário Br que vcs tavam procurando

Why did u report him tho.. dick

True, the "remote controller" was connected to the "robot" so it's not a remote controlled robot.

"In practice, this is usually an electromechanical system that, by its appearance or its movements, offers the sensation of having its own purpose" "There is no consensus on what machines can be considered robots" WIKIPEDIA. And to clarify something can be remote control and use physical connection, Although the end of the video if it is a little loose.

@vertops4269  Full text " The word robot can refer to both physical robots and virtual software agents, but the latter are usually referred to as bots.[13] There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data or physical perceptions electronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals.[14][15] Closely related to the concept of a robot is the field of Synthetic Biology, which studies entities whose nature is more comparable to beings than to machines. " WIKIPEDIA, ROBOTS

If it's a "robot" so all smarthphones are robots while vibrate. If it's a "robot spider" so any human sculpture are "robots humans" while earthquake. If you install this mechanism in a Mr. Potato Head, will it become a "Robot Head" and "Robot potato" and "Robot Humanoid"? Are all vibrators robots? Is a remote vibrator a robot?

@Saberwulfy  I did not put the complete fragment because it can be extrapolated allegorically. Can you call a "cardboard robot" a robot? Yes, and if I call it a robot, would it be a cardboard robot? Well, no, that's what I mean, on YouTube, there are thousands of videos of "domestic robots" that are not robots, because allegorically you can call them robots if they fulfill the task of representing them, even if they are not real robots. For this reason, these videos have existed for years.

Same here haha

D3mOnD -_-SpAwN illustrative

Waste of time.

Wheres the Exotic Lair comment?

Dude this is fake i tried it and it did not work this guy is a liar

The antenna isn't even hooked up it has no purpose, its controlled using the wire.

Вначале показали совершенно другого паука на радиоуправлении. А потом эту проводную фигню в конце. Чё за хуйня?

its just a vibrate toy ... its movements are not like even spider

Can you make smallest camera drone

Ur really nothing to do

Its not remote controlled but I thought that the stop motion was kinda cute tbh

Clickbait.

There are some entitled people out there these days. Back when I was a kid this would have BLOWN my mind as this guy just made something we would have seen as the latest Christmas or birthday toy (yes even wired as most toys with controllers were back then) FROM SCRATCH!  Rather than putting it down, see it for what it is; inspiration to build your own version as high tech and wizz bang as you like. But you won't because you haven't an ounce of the skill or creativity as this guy so would rather sit there and piss on his parade and cry about being ripped off, etc, out of pettiness and jealousy. Prove us all otherwise by putting your own better version out there or go wallow in it. Toss bags.  Subbed mate, you are ace! :)

Him: Learn how to make a RoboSpider  Me: Sets house on fire and walks away 🔥

But the question is :  CAN IT ENDURE THE FLAMETHROWER? 🤔

Why there is a antenna for wired controller...😑

I don't think this guy knows what remote control means

Que m.... Propaganda enganosa.

This dude makes his toys I wish you was my dad!!!!!!!😭💔😭💔😭😭😭 😭😭 😭💔

13 minutes gone of my life

Amazing...

I don't see any 👽

Well people dislike it because it IS A RIPOFF! It just comes off as borderline manipulative (not saying it is). It just makes it seem like hes just fishing for views. Weather or not its impressive is besides the point.

The point is that it's click bait. The remote controller part and the robot part. I'm not saying that this is trash and all but it's click bait.

Better question; can it withstand a mag dump from a Block gen4 9mm?

I think he can resist just 2min and then she Will be melted in 10 min

🤣

Yeah

HAHAHAHAHA

I think its you who doesnt

It IS remote control, just not wireless. It's a shitty video nonetheless.

This is remote control. You're probably thinking of radio control.

@duanemassey4560  if you look up the definition of remote control it only refers to radio and or infrared  signals

😂😅yeah

@eriqmassa  - There are sites that explain the difference between remote and radio control

eriqmassa lol

he know how to make good marketing

Its called clickbait crap

@eriqmassa  Don't know where you got that definition, but you're obviously too young to know that the first remote controlled televisions had a wired remote controller. There are many remote controlled systems still in use today that are wired.  That definition is wrong.

@Jimmeh_B  The definition is from Oxford dictionary actually. I believe that is the dictionary in which holds the highest standard for defining the English language. That is why it is used in schools and many businesses such as Google. It is possible that remote control meant something different back in your day but at the time of this video and for many years the definition has definatly changed

eriqmassa er....no. Let’s think....”remote” meaning: “far away” (OED definition) “control” meaning: (when referring to a machine) “the switches and buttons that allow you to operate a machine or vehicle” (also OED definition). Put them together. Remote control: a means of operating a machine or vehicle from a distance. That doesn’t say how. Wires, wireless, infra red. It doesn’t matter. The definition hasn’t changed. It’s quite simple....like you.

You are used to wireless things thats too advance way back in our time remote controls do really have wires on it. Anyways you can still see there are some toys who have remote with wire connected to the toys than wireless

He misspelled his title and put a 'p' where the 'l' should have been

Booo!

So looked up remote control on Oxford dictionary and the UK English only has the radio or inferred control but when you switch to us English the 1.1 definition is: 1.1A device that controls a machine, especially a television or VCR, from a distance.

=))

XD XD XD

@reaperandyel  stop your complqining. Its a how to video meant to show you how to make this contraption yourself. If you want to see giant contraptions you could never realistically afford go somewhere else

It is remote controlled. It’s just not wireless.

@Prabha Fulzele Thank you

And I don’t think ur being nice

It is indeed a remote controlled mini spider..  what you mean he doesn't know?   It is not wireless thou..

@reaperandyel  remote control implies just that. Something that is controlled remotely (usually by wires). Radio control is something controlled by wireless (radio) waves...

it's RC (Remote Control), it's true tho. but it isn't RC (radio control) like what we expect.

@eriqmassa  dumb ass. 🤣 😂

I mean it's still remote controlled it's just not wireless

Y la antena pa que cojones la pone?

The remote control part aside, the actual spider sculpture is pretty cool looking tbh

This reminds me if toy story when woody gets fixed up

What a waste of time. It's not even remotely remote controlled. Don't waste your time.

Click bait don't bother watching

¿Como se llama la primera musica de fondo?

Acho que dá pra fazer as pernas andarem. Um pequeno motor, na traseira, e ligado ao motor,  penos pistões, posicionada para impulsos na horizontal. As pernas, são ligadas, com molas, perto do abdômen ou numa articulação, mais próximo do abdômen. E fio de arame, para  como fosse tendões, ligado no pistão e nas pernas.   Parece que nessa idéia, tem que ter um pistão   para as pernas da direita e outra engrenagem, para as pernas da esquerda, ou um pistão, para cada perna.

Вери гуд

PLEASE make a centipede! I would love to know how to make one!

oh, boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooy

Waste of my time...stop using time lapse animation at the start

Есле оно на проводе , то зачем антена?

Thank you.>:)

Hi there! What´s the motor type please? Thx!

I stopped walking to college... Now i vibrate to college 😎

🖕 Fuck you and your click bait

Me gusta no Soi Lupita sí Óscar

5.01 and i have a bad feeling about this. Smells like clickbait

What's the point of the if it's wired

Leave

Pretty sure he did.

And change it with a PIC or AVR microcontroller and some RF modules, to control remotely with a computer or a Android device.

😂😂😂

underrated comment!!

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

why you put antenna in remote control? 🤭

Next remote controlled human k?

You just scammed people in this video. You have shown something very amazing in the beginning and something shit in the end. And your miss leading rf remote control! Wonderful.

клёвая игрушкп

how very... hipster with the antenna on a wired device.  i thought you were going to put a Bluetooth trinket Arduino in the abdominal cavity... 😑

Hola basureros

THIS FUCKING CHANNEL IS FAKE

Who says Spiders need legs to move?

Stupid

Is it possible to put a wireless camera on it?

🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Expectative  👉00: 01 ?

Troll stupid video!¡!¡

good kid

Not interested

Hay

ربنا يشفي 😒😒😒

dogs shit

Long time

😱🤮🤯🧐🤖☠🤘🙏👍

1. It's not remote control 2. It was clickbait and 3. It's just a glorified vibrator

Because he haves a several brain damage

For looks maybe.nothing wrong wid that lol

becuz most bugs have antenna

Obanai Iguro Aracnids are usually bugs without antenna

It was stop motion in the beginning.  If you actually read anything you'd know that instead of looking like a idiot.

Me too.

Anal cavity lmao  Ok, Mr. Expert Fortnite Kidd

Bro...It's title attract...  That's y we are here

May be

Creative kid

Hello

Yeah

Bro 🙋‍♂

Ohh true

I think first was stopmotion

НАХУЯ ТЕБЕ АНТЕННА?

Beatiful spider

what happened to the legs of the spider why are they not moving,as they moved in the beginning of the video.and at last nothing moved.

Estos bastardos!!!, me siento estafado, 13min de mi vida desperidiciados

13:01 weeeeee

Clickbait

The legs dont even move wtf worst spider ever pls diss like

THIS VIDEO IS A SCAM. A BIG THUMBS DOWN. 👎

nice👍

Your are frod shown something and made some thing 😡😡

Fak

Very cheeky, using a photo that has no relation whatsoever to the project you filmed. So thumbs down for that. Now if i want to get a bit more picky, what's the point of the antenna on the remote control? It's not wireless so the antenna serves no purpose, not even aesthetically. Thumbs down for that too. Sorry mate, but that was a waste of time.

Es mejor que camine no Que aga así como ahi

Nice video sir #technomasterjee

Fake

BURN IT WITHFIRE

All that work just to make a vibrator 😂😂 jk good work!

Fail Lmao

Potang ina!

If it is related because it is the same as it did, it is clearly seen, but the final result is not what was expected

😂😂😂

BRAVOoooooooooooooooooooo

#secureteam

Why does the spider move at the beginning looked like it was stop motion

Why u don't tell the first one how u made it

yeah.. remote... wired one

Its spider toy, not a robot bro?

Funny

Music name please I like it

Dont use un-insulated wire, thats very dangerous

4:25 alguien sabe el nombre de la canción?

Muito top ideia de gênio

Great invention

--_--

wtf is this  u just waste my 14 min worst video of youtube

@Secureteam10 your outro 😁😁

Expectation 0:01 Reality  13:01

You just showed how crappy your finished product was compared to the clickbait... lol

Why so your art but don't clickbait that's stupid

Video starts at 0:00  Ur welcome

Lol At first, I had no idea how it was going to remote control. Cool video! 👍

Because its fake

That is a robot, a toy can be a robot, eg a r3mote controll car is indeed a robot.

Yes bro

Your stupid

😅😅😅

Yeah bro

A ver A ver Que paso!!!  0:02  13:14   Nos engañaron :c     Pdt: esta muy entretenido y queda bonito pero  sería mas efectivo con una mini  cámara ;-)   ;-)

Nonsense

İ want to buy it

Awesome .

Next video how to make human-like robot

Great

Simply only u can do it damn good😎

Oh......k     Beautiful work though, lol

Make this n  give it to 🤣😂😂 Spiderman

This was some BS. Not only was the final result twice the size of what was in the thumbnail and intro, it was significantly different. Also the mode of motion is implied to be (in the intro) via actual leg motion, when in fact it just vibrates along the surface. The total disconnect between what is shown at the beginning, and in the thumbnail, and what the actual result turns out being makes this garbage clickbait. And your weak disclaimers don't change that. It's significant that over 1700 people seem to agree with me.

Alguien lo tiene que decir... Altos brazos....

Nice job quel est son utilitè

Fake. The spider was a paid actor.

0:05 Rip leg

Trash

Бляя, что ето за говнище, у меня друг в 12 лет такое делал, а тут взрослый человек.

number 1??no is nuber ok

kd a merda da aranha certa??

Great👌👏👍

J'ai passé 13min a regarder ça penssant que cetait un vrai robot qu'il a vraiment fabriqué mais non...n importe quoi il s est payé notre temps.

Es un stop motion el intro, no es el resultado final.

@Aqua Sama Es un video con imagenes que duran milisegundos, es decir una secuencia de fotos tomadas una de tras de la otra para dar la impresion de que el objeto se esta moviendo, en este caso la araña.

Dimitronix thanks https://youtu.be/GhrGQkXrLcQ

😅

It was stop motion in the beginning.  If you actually read anything you'd know that instead of looking like a idiot.

@alberthooke4409  Gracias =) te deseo lo mejor en la vida. Saludos desde Argentina!!

this is so fake!!!

Cool

Good ole click bait

It is fake for this I will not subcribe to yur channel and I mean it!

Я все ждал когда он ширку заварит .

the end try not laugh :v

8796665

Amazing camera skills.

first of all, in the beginning of the video the spider could move its legs and at the end it was just vibrating. And the title of the video says remote controlled, but you are just using thin wires to control it.

Wiytwfl

Oh soo this is why my brother watch this video and make a robot spider to scared me at HOME !!!!😠 😢😢😢😢i got scared soo much !

Donde están los chips inteligente,

Do you know what is "remote control"?

thank you for doing it on my birthday!

Wow so cool

WHAT'S THE MUSIC'S NAME?

Too distracting hearing the old theme song for the secureteam10 channel playing during the first four minutes.

Scam. What you see is what you dont get.

F0lk u

THOSE DISLIKES ARE FROM OUR MOTHERS WHO TOLD YOU TO KEEP STUDYING MECHANISM

Fr

Do you understand the Taco language?

Sorry i dont speak school shooting

Carlos Alberto Mariduena Munoz your joke sucks

Do you know what is remote control? Because he did indeed make it remote controlled. It's controlled by a remote, via wire, not to be confused with RADIO remote controlled, which are most miniature race cars/planes etc etc

Well happy birthday🎂🎁🎉👑

And the last three.

clickbait

can u add laser beam to annihilate all spider?

Bad

Ihih, lovely! Peter Parker would look forward to this!XD

Solo le iso un vibrador al araña 😩

There are many dark spots in the video. 1. The final product is way way different than the originally shown. 2. There are 4 motors, but you showed only two. 3. Why you used the telescopic antenna and connected the spider with wire.   Kindly explain, untill no like and no subscribe also no share.

Amazing ,i like it ..

What song is playing?

Use this thing to do a prank

without the technology that people created it would have been impossible or harder

NOICE

Destruiu minha esperanca de ver ela anda como uma aranha de verdade...-.-

Can u please text me on 7004652649 I need help in project

Omg realistic

At the beginning there's a realistic robot spider because it was obviously a real robot spider, and when he killed it, he realized how cool it was, and he tried to replicate it, but he couldn't.   So stop saying it's clickbait you people, you just don't understand the beauty of a robot spider.

No Fucking Way

Read the pinned comment..

Wow Superb

Stop motion right

Lol

Every one Watch this full video and doesn't do  Hit a like here🤚

انت كسرت هاتفين من اجل ان تحصل على محركين صغيرين لصنع العنكبوت.  اقدر. جهدك يا اخي.👍👍👍👍👍

dude, bit misleading don't you think? why is the legs moving on the first spider then the one you make is just a vibrating spider? I was a bit gutted to see the end like this. I like the video though as your efforts on making this was ace, well thought about and unique too, just a shame that it wasn't the spider advertised at the beginning.

Robot

Кликбейт!

Music name?????

Nice body your sir

Oops i am sorry

Nicr

I think it's useless

Wonderful

Nice one

Eric Shen  who you calling a beggar

It was stop motion in the beginning.  If you actually read anything you'd know that instead of looking like a idiot.

Aceroc are u just going though everyone’s comments and copy and past the same sh#t to ppl that was disappointed in the video! Because that’s 6 identical comments   It is well made but come on you can sit there and call ppl idiots for getting mislead

@aceroc20able  who told you to but in on my comments? I think chris carson has basically told you what I am thinking, your the mind dumb muppet who needs to think about writing an original comment for a change.

This is not wireless

My mum tried to kill it.

The spider shown first is not the shown at last.

baited

what kind of clickbait is this

Slowing moves

This video is a waist of time at the beginning the spider ia walking ang at the end its just like a toy car.

How a about fly,.... 😑

How a about fly,.... 😑

I have a hex bug spider

Since this is clearly a wired remote control...  is there  a reason you put an antenna on the control box? Seems really pointless to me.

Good and beautiful and great work amazing videos

Amazing how 😱😱

Awesome!

Really awesome dude!

Hello, the introduction of the video is a stop motion, I like art and animation, that's why I did it, I do not want to imply that this is the final result, it's just the introduction of this, (stop motion 0:0, construction 0:22, end result 12:52) only if you plan to recreate what is shown in the video, read the full description to see the recommendations, otherwise, enjoy!

great friend congratulations

That is so sick!!

Un noticiero russo? Que ase aquí??

I loved the rocket ship, it could be cool to do others like the Space Shuttle, Saturn V or maybe fictional ones like  the USS Enterprise or Millennium Falcon if you wanted to.

Ma cosa cazzo combini video assolutamente deludente rispetto alle aspettative il ragno è uscito completamente diverso da quello che fai vedere all'inizio, all'inizio c'è anche un sedere fatto con la carta di alluminio e tutte le zampe si muovono invece quello finale non ha il sedere è fatto in modo diverso e le zampe non si muovono ma che schifezza di video hai fatto ? Hai preso per il culo per tutto il video
