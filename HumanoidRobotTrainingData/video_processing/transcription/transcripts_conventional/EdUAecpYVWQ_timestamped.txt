[00:00:00.400 → 00:00:16.000] Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel all about electronics.
[00:00:16.000 → 00:00:20.600] So in this video and the subsequent videos, we will learn about the diode.
[00:00:20.600 → 00:00:24.880] And these are the following topics that we will cover in the series of videos.
[00:00:24.880 → 00:00:29.760] And in this particular video, we will learn that what is diode and how the VI characteristic
[00:00:29.760 → 00:00:31.980] of the diode will look like.
[00:00:31.980 → 00:00:35.440] And we will also see the equivalent circuit for this diode.
[00:00:35.440 → 00:00:39.120] And in the subsequent videos, we will learn about the device physics of this diode.
[00:00:39.120 → 00:00:42.260] And we will also see the different applications of the diode.
[00:00:42.260 → 00:00:44.620] So now the question is, what is diode?
[00:00:44.620 → 00:00:46.720] Now we all know about the resistor.
[00:00:46.720 → 00:00:50.060] It is the most widely used type of passive circuit element.
[00:00:50.060 → 00:00:53.000] And it allows the flow of current in both directions.
[00:00:53.000 → 00:00:58.360] Similarly, this diode is a two-terminal semiconductor device which allows the flow of current only
[00:00:58.360 → 00:01:00.200] in one direction.
[00:01:00.200 → 00:01:04.100] And if you see the symbol of the diode, then it looks like this.
[00:01:04.100 → 00:01:09.540] So here, this arrow indicates the direction in which this diode allows the flow of current.
[00:01:09.540 → 00:01:12.500] Now the one terminal of this diode is known as the anode.
[00:01:12.500 → 00:01:15.800] And the second terminal of the diode is known as the cathode.
[00:01:15.800 → 00:01:20.100] Now whether this diode will allow the flow of current or not, it depends upon the polarity
[00:01:20.100 → 00:01:23.720] of the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode.
[00:01:23.720 → 00:01:28.440] So, if the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode is positive, then in
[00:01:28.440 → 00:01:32.600] general we can say that this diode will allow the flow of current in one direction.
[00:01:32.600 → 00:01:37.300] While the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode is negative, then it will
[00:01:37.300 → 00:01:39.480] not allow the flow of current.
[00:01:39.480 → 00:01:44.420] So now when this diode is connected in particular circuit, and if you want to analyze that circuit,
[00:01:44.420 → 00:01:48.740] then the circuit can be analyzed by knowing the voltage and current that is flowing through
[00:01:48.740 → 00:01:49.740] this diode.
[00:01:49.740 → 00:01:54.020] And that can be found using the VI characteristic of the diode.
[00:01:54.020 → 00:01:57.720] Now for the resistor, we know that it is a linear element and the relationship between
[00:01:57.720 → 00:02:00.040] the voltage and current is linear.
[00:02:00.040 → 00:02:05.300] So using the Ohm's law, we can easily find the voltage and current through this resistor.
[00:02:05.300 → 00:02:09.240] But unlike the case of resistor, the diode is a nonlinear element.
[00:02:09.240 → 00:02:13.780] So the relationship between the voltage and current for the diode is nonlinear.
[00:02:13.780 → 00:02:18.700] And moreover that, this diode allows the flow of current only in one direction.
[00:02:18.700 → 00:02:22.220] And it almost blocks the current in the reverse direction.
[00:02:22.220 → 00:02:28.220] Now if you look this graph, then it looks like the graph is symmetrical in both directions.
[00:02:28.220 → 00:02:30.880] But don't get confused by the symmetricity.
[00:02:30.880 → 00:02:34.980] Because here in this graph, both the positive and the negative axis have a different scale.
[00:02:34.980 → 00:02:40.760] For example, on the positive y-axis, we have a scale in mA, while on the negative y-axis,
[00:02:40.760 → 00:02:42.980] we have a scale in µA.
[00:02:42.980 → 00:02:48.680] Similarly on the positive x-axis, if you see, the voltage varies like 0.5V, 1V, and 1.5V.
[00:02:48.680 → 00:02:56.360] While if you observe on the negative x-axis, the voltage scale varies like –10V, 20V,
[00:02:56.360 → 00:02:58.360] and –30V.
[00:02:58.360 → 00:03:03.160] So because of the different scale, this characteristic looks symmetrical on both axes.
[00:03:03.160 → 00:03:07.240] But if we keep the same scale on both axes, then the diode characteristic will look like
[00:03:07.240 → 00:03:08.240] this.
[00:03:08.240 → 00:03:11.320] So as you can see, in the reverse direction, the current that is flowing through the diode
[00:03:11.320 → 00:03:12.680] is almost negligible.
[00:03:12.680 → 00:03:17.040] So, using this VI characteristic of the diode, we can easily find the voltage and current
[00:03:17.040 → 00:03:18.860] that is flowing through the diode.
[00:03:18.860 → 00:03:23.880] And using this, we can easily analyze any circuit which contains these diodes.
[00:03:23.880 → 00:03:28.020] But because of the nonlinear characteristic of this diode curve, it is a bit difficult
[00:03:28.020 → 00:03:30.360] to find the voltage and current very easily.
[00:03:30.360 → 00:03:35.620] So, what we can do, we can approximate this diode characteristic and using this, we can analyze
[00:03:35.620 → 00:03:36.680] the circuits.
[00:03:36.680 → 00:03:41.500] So, first of all, what we will do, we will consider this diode as an ideal diode.
[00:03:41.500 → 00:03:44.960] And for this ideal diode, we will see the VI characteristic.
[00:03:44.960 → 00:03:48.500] And also we will see the equivalent circuit for this ideal diode.
[00:03:48.500 → 00:03:53.540] And step by step, we will introduce few more parameters to this ideal diode.
[00:03:53.540 → 00:03:57.900] And using this, we will approximate the diode characteristic curve.
[00:03:57.900 → 00:04:01.900] So for the ideal diode, whenever the voltage that is applied between the anode and cathode
[00:04:01.900 → 00:04:05.980] is positive, then simply it will act as a closed switch.
[00:04:05.980 → 00:04:10.420] On the other hand, if the voltage that is applied between this anode and cathode is negative,
[00:04:10.420 → 00:04:13.600] in that case, simply it will act as an open switch.
[00:04:13.600 → 00:04:16.780] So now let's see the VI characteristic for this ideal diode.
[00:04:16.780 → 00:04:21.900] So, in the case 1, when the applied voltage is positive, on the VI characteristic, we will
[00:04:21.900 → 00:04:24.020] get the vertical line.
[00:04:24.020 → 00:04:28.520] And for the case 2, when the applied voltage is negative, then for that case, we will get
[00:04:28.520 → 00:04:32.180] the horizontal line on the negative x direction.
[00:04:32.180 → 00:04:34.960] So this is the VI characteristic for the ideal diode.
[00:04:34.960 → 00:04:39.740] So now whenever the positive voltage is applied to this diode, then it can be said that the
[00:04:39.740 → 00:04:41.280] diode has been forward biased.
[00:04:41.280 → 00:04:43.280] And it will allow the flow of current.
[00:04:43.280 → 00:04:47.900] While on the other hand, whenever the negative voltage is applied to this diode, then it will
[00:04:47.900 → 00:04:49.640] not allow the flow of current.
[00:04:49.640 → 00:04:52.500] And simply we can say that it has been reverse biased.
[00:04:52.500 → 00:04:56.760] So we will talk more about this forward and reverse bias at the later part of the video.
[00:04:56.760 → 00:05:01.680] So now let's take one simple example in which the diode is connected in series with the voltage
[00:05:01.680 → 00:05:03.600] source and the resistor.
[00:05:03.600 → 00:05:06.980] Now here we are assuming that the diode is an ideal diode.
[00:05:06.980 → 00:05:11.000] It means that whenever the voltage that is appearing across the anode and cathode of
[00:05:11.000 → 00:05:15.600] the diode is positive, then simply it can be represented by the closed switch.
[00:05:15.600 → 00:05:19.640] And as you can see over here, the applied voltage across the diode is 10V.
[00:05:19.640 → 00:05:23.200] So, simply it can be represented by the closed switch.
[00:05:23.200 → 00:05:27.200] And the current that is flowing through this 100Ω resistor will be equal to 10V divided
[00:05:27.200 → 00:05:28.200] by 100Ω.
[00:05:28.200 → 00:05:30.040] That is equal to 0.1A.
[00:05:30.040 → 00:05:35.760] While on the other hand, if we apply the minus 10V in this circuit, then the applied voltage
[00:05:35.760 → 00:05:38.460] across the diode will be minus 10V.
[00:05:38.460 → 00:05:40.200] And it will not allow any flow of current.
[00:05:40.200 → 00:05:42.600] So, simply it will act as an open switch.
[00:05:42.600 → 00:05:46.380] And the current that is flowing through the circuit will be equal to 0A.
[00:05:46.380 → 00:05:51.540] Now some of you might have a question that how to find the voltage across this diode.
[00:05:51.540 → 00:05:57.020] So, that can be found by finding the Thevenin's equivalent voltage between these two terminals.
[00:05:57.020 → 00:06:00.780] So, simply you need to remove this diode from the circuit and you need to find the Thevenin's
[00:06:00.780 → 00:06:03.420] equivalent voltage between these two terminals.
[00:06:03.420 → 00:06:07.660] So, if you remove this diode, then the Thevenin's equivalent voltage which appears between this
[00:06:07.660 → 00:06:11.540] anode and the cathode in this particular case will be equal to minus 10V.
[00:06:11.540 → 00:06:15.720] And because of that, the diode will be non-conducting.
[00:06:15.720 → 00:06:20.840] On the other hand, whenever the 10V is appearing between these two terminals, then the diode simply
[00:06:20.840 → 00:06:23.040] will act as a closed switch.
[00:06:23.040 → 00:06:27.900] Now, if you see the VI characteristic of this ideal diode, then you can observe that even
[00:06:27.900 → 00:06:32.480] if we apply very small positive voltage between this anode and cathode, then also this diode
[00:06:32.480 → 00:06:33.720] will start conducting.
[00:06:33.720 → 00:06:39.880] So, let's say even if we apply the positive 0.1V between this anode and cathode, then also
[00:06:39.880 → 00:06:42.720] this ideal diode should start conducting.
[00:06:42.720 → 00:06:47.700] But if you see the actual diode, it will start conducting only after the applied voltage cross
[00:06:47.700 → 00:06:49.500] some threshold voltage.
[00:06:49.500 → 00:06:52.220] And if you see the VI characteristic, then it will look like this.
[00:06:52.220 → 00:06:56.960] So, up to certain threshold voltage, the diode will not allow any flow of current.
[00:06:56.960 → 00:07:00.440] And whenever the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage, then only the diode will
[00:07:00.440 → 00:07:01.960] allow the flow of current.
[00:07:01.960 → 00:07:07.560] So, this voltage is known as the threshold voltage or the cutting voltage for the diode.
[00:07:07.560 → 00:07:11.400] Now, like I said before, this diode is a semiconductor device.
[00:07:11.400 → 00:07:14.920] And usually it is made up of either silicon or germanium.
[00:07:14.920 → 00:07:19.280] So, for silicon, this threshold voltage used to be in the range of 0.6 to 0.7V.
[00:07:19.280 → 00:07:23.700] While for germanium, usually it is around 0.3V.
[00:07:23.700 → 00:07:28.400] So, actually the diode will start conducting once the applied voltage crosses this threshold
[00:07:28.400 → 00:07:29.400] voltage.
[00:07:29.400 → 00:07:32.860] And before that, it will not allow any flow of current.
[00:07:32.860 → 00:07:36.140] So, this is the first approximation for the diode curve.
[00:07:36.140 → 00:07:40.400] So, here in this approximation, we are considering this diode as an ideal diode.
[00:07:40.400 → 00:07:45.260] But it will only allow the flow of current once the applied voltage crosses this threshold
[00:07:45.260 → 00:07:46.260] voltage.
[00:07:46.260 → 00:07:49.080] And the equivalent circuit will look like this.
[00:07:49.080 → 00:07:54.080] So, in case of reverse bias, it will simply act as an open switch.
[00:07:54.080 → 00:07:58.780] But whenever the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage, then only it will allow the
[00:07:58.780 → 00:07:59.900] flow of current.
[00:07:59.900 → 00:08:06.540] So, now let's take the same example that we have taken earlier.
[00:08:06.540 → 00:08:12.140] So, in this approximation, we are considering this diode as an ideal diode except the fact
[00:08:12.140 → 00:08:17.180] that it will allow the flow of current only after the applied voltage crosses the threshold
[00:08:17.180 → 00:08:18.240] voltage.
[00:08:18.240 → 00:08:23.080] And here we are assuming that the diode that is used is the silicon diode.
[00:08:23.080 → 00:08:26.840] So, it has a threshold voltage of 0.7V.
[00:08:26.840 → 00:08:31.760] So, once the applied voltage crosses this 0.7V barrier, then only it will allow the flow
[00:08:31.760 → 00:08:32.760] of current.
[00:08:32.760 → 00:08:39.280] Now, here as the applied voltage is 10V, so simply this diode will allow the flow of current.
[00:08:39.280 → 00:08:41.540] And the equivalent circuit will look like this.
[00:08:41.540 → 00:08:46.640] So, now if you find the current that is flowing through this 100Ω resistor, it will be equal
[00:08:46.640 → 00:08:50.600] to 10V minus 0.7V divided by 100Ω.
[00:08:50.600 → 00:08:53.400] That is equal to 0.093A.
[00:08:53.400 → 00:08:59.600] While on the earlier case, when we have considered this diode as an ideal diode, at that time,
[00:08:59.600 → 00:09:03.440] we found the value of this current as 0.1A.
[00:09:03.440 → 00:09:07.360] So, using this approximation, we can find the more accurate values of voltage and current
[00:09:07.360 → 00:09:09.040] in the circuit.
[00:09:09.040 → 00:09:14.360] Now in the same approximation, suppose if we apply the minus 10V, then in that case, the
[00:09:14.360 → 00:09:17.200] current will simply act as an open switch.
[00:09:17.200 → 00:09:19.320] And it will not allow any flow of current.
[00:09:19.320 → 00:09:23.600] So, the current that is flowing through this resistor will be equal to 0A.
[00:09:23.600 → 00:09:30.680] Now, in this first approximation also, we have considered that the diode has a 0 resistance.
[00:09:30.680 → 00:09:34.480] And that can be also visible from the VI characteristic of this diode.
[00:09:34.480 → 00:09:40.340] Because if you observe over here, once the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage,
[00:09:40.340 → 00:09:44.780] then the voltage that appears across the diode will remain constant.
[00:09:44.780 → 00:09:46.780] And only current will increase.
[00:09:46.780 → 00:09:49.880] It means that the diode offers the 0 resistance.
[00:09:49.880 → 00:09:54.860] But in actual case, every device has some finite resistance, which will limit the current
[00:09:54.860 → 00:09:56.900] that is flowing through that particular device.
[00:09:56.900 → 00:10:02.760] So, now let's consider the second approximation, where we are also considering that the diode has
[00:10:02.760 → 00:10:04.660] some finite resistance.
[00:10:04.660 → 00:10:09.780] And in that case, if you see the VI characteristic, then it will look like this.
[00:10:09.780 → 00:10:14.360] So, up to the threshold voltage, the diode will offer infinite resistance or simply it will
[00:10:14.360 → 00:10:16.300] act as an open switch.
[00:10:16.300 → 00:10:19.620] And then after, it will provide some finite resistance.
[00:10:19.620 → 00:10:23.100] And that resistance can be found from the slope of this curve.
[00:10:23.100 → 00:10:27.900] So, this resistance is also known as the bulk resistance or the body resistance.
[00:10:27.900 → 00:10:32.660] So, this resistance is the resistance that is offered by the semiconductor device out of
[00:10:32.660 → 00:10:35.100] which this diode has been made.
[00:10:35.100 → 00:10:39.540] So, now let's see the equivalent circuit for this second approximation.
[00:10:39.540 → 00:10:44.940] So, whenever the diode is reversed biased, in that case simply it will offer the infinite
[00:10:44.940 → 00:10:49.480] resistance or we can say that it will act as an open switch.
[00:10:49.480 → 00:10:54.800] But whenever the applied voltage crosses this threshold voltage, in that case, now it will
[00:10:54.800 → 00:10:57.440] offer some finite resistance of Rb.
[00:10:57.440 → 00:10:59.540] That is the bulk resistance of this diode.
[00:10:59.540 → 00:11:03.980] So, this is the equivalent circuit in case of the second approximation.
[00:11:03.980 → 00:11:09.100] Now, apart from this bulk resistance, diode has one more resistance.
[00:11:09.100 → 00:11:12.720] And this resistance is present in the diode because of its internal structure.
[00:11:12.720 → 00:11:16.980] So, we will talk more about this diode resistance in the separate video.
[00:11:16.980 → 00:11:20.700] Now, typically the value of this resistance used to be a few ohms.
[00:11:20.700 → 00:11:26.440] So, in the circuit, if the Thevenin's equivalent resistance which appears across the diode is much
[00:11:26.440 → 00:11:31.880] more than the diode resistance, in that case, the diode resistance can be neglected.
[00:11:31.880 → 00:11:37.280] But if the Thevenin's equivalent resistance which appears across the diode is comparable
[00:11:37.280 → 00:11:42.000] to the diode resistance, in that case, we also need to consider this diode resistance.
[00:11:42.000 → 00:11:48.440] So, for example, in this case, let us assume that the diode has a resistance of 25 ohms.
[00:11:48.440 → 00:11:52.000] Now, this resistor is comparable to this 100 ohm resistor.
[00:11:52.000 → 00:11:54.880] So, we need to consider this diode resistance.
[00:11:54.880 → 00:12:00.440] So, if we consider this diode resistance, then the current that is flowing through this 100
[00:12:00.440 → 00:12:07.880] ohm resistor will be equal to 10V-0.7V divided by 125 ohm.
[00:12:07.880 → 00:12:13.440] And if you see the current, it will be equal to 0.074 ampere.
[00:12:13.440 → 00:12:18.480] So, because of this diode resistance, if you see, now the actual current that is flowing
[00:12:18.480 → 00:12:21.240] through this 100 ohm resistor will change.
[00:12:21.240 → 00:12:25.440] So, using this second approximation, we can find the more accurate value of the current and
[00:12:25.440 → 00:12:28.840] voltage that is flowing through the circuit.
[00:12:28.840 → 00:12:33.320] But in most of the circuits, the Thevenin's equivalent resistance which appears across the
[00:12:33.320 → 00:12:37.200] diode used to be much larger than this diode resistance.
[00:12:37.200 → 00:12:40.440] And simply we can neglect this diode resistance.
[00:12:40.440 → 00:12:47.320] So, in this second approximation of this diode, we have assumed that the diode is non-conducting
[00:12:47.320 → 00:12:51.200] till the point the applied voltage crosses the threshold voltage.
[00:12:51.200 → 00:12:53.940] And then after it offers some finite resistance.
[00:12:53.940 → 00:13:00.820] So, if you see this type of characteristic, then it is known as the piecewise linear characteristic.
[00:13:00.820 → 00:13:05.260] Because what we have done, we have segmented the actual characteristic of this diode into
[00:13:05.260 → 00:13:07.320] the piecewise linear characteristic.
[00:13:07.320 → 00:13:13.000] So, up to the threshold voltage, we have assumed that the diode is non-conducting.
[00:13:13.000 → 00:13:17.080] And after the threshold voltage, it will offer some finite resistance.
[00:13:17.080 → 00:13:21.480] Okay, so now let's talk about the actual curve of this diode.
[00:13:21.480 → 00:13:27.280] So, in this diode curve, like I said before, this region is known as the forward region.
[00:13:27.280 → 00:13:32.660] Because once the applied voltage crosses the threshold voltage, then the diode starts conducting.
[00:13:32.660 → 00:13:37.400] And whenever the applied voltage is less than the threshold voltage, in that case, the current
[00:13:37.400 → 00:13:40.340] that is flowing through the diode is almost negligible.
[00:13:40.340 → 00:13:45.340] Now, whenever we apply the reverse voltage to this diode, then that region of operation
[00:13:45.340 → 00:13:48.220] is known as the reverse region of operation.
[00:13:48.220 → 00:13:53.340] And in this region, the current that is flowing through the diode used to be very small.
[00:13:53.340 → 00:13:59.020] And this current is known as the reverse saturation current of the diode.
[00:13:59.020 → 00:14:05.420] So, as you can see from the graph, even if we increase this reverse voltage across the diode,
[00:14:05.420 → 00:14:09.880] then also the current will only increase by marginal amount.
[00:14:09.880 → 00:14:13.540] But we cannot increase this reverse voltage indefinitely.
[00:14:13.540 → 00:14:19.700] Because if we go beyond certain voltage, then the diode will come into the breakdown region.
[00:14:19.700 → 00:14:22.940] So, this region of operation is known as the breakdown region.
[00:14:22.940 → 00:14:25.720] And this region of operation should be avoided.
[00:14:25.720 → 00:14:31.980] Now, some diodes are specifically made to pretend this particular breakdown region.
[00:14:31.980 → 00:14:35.200] And this type of diodes are known as the Zener diode.
[00:14:35.200 → 00:14:39.300] So we will talk more about this Zener diode in the separate video.
[00:14:39.300 → 00:14:45.240] But for any normal signal diodes, this region of operation should be avoided.
[00:14:45.240 → 00:14:50.460] So if you see the datasheet, you will find that the maximum breakdown voltage for the diode
[00:14:50.460 → 00:14:52.080] has been mentioned.
[00:14:52.080 → 00:14:56.680] So the applied reverse voltage should be less than this breakdown voltage.
[00:14:56.680 → 00:15:01.960] Now in the forward region of this diode characteristic curve, if you observe, as the voltage across
[00:15:01.960 → 00:15:07.760] the diode increases, the current that is flowing through the diode will increase exponentially.
[00:15:07.760 → 00:15:13.200] So in datasheets, you will also find one more parameter that is known as the maximum allowable
[00:15:13.200 → 00:15:14.640] forward current.
[00:15:14.640 → 00:15:19.300] So diode current should be less than this maximum allowable forward current.
[00:15:19.300 → 00:15:24.440] So here are the few parameters that we will find in the datasheet of any diode.
[00:15:24.440 → 00:15:28.540] So now in the next video, we will talk more about the diode resistance.
[00:15:28.540 → 00:15:34.240] So I hope in this video you understood what is diode and the Vi characteristic of the diode.
