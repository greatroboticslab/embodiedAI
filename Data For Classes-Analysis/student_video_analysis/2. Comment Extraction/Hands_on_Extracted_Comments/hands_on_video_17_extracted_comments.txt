nowadays we use AI to make codes for projects

Bro, fix the code bugs 😮

top thank you!

I want to make a robotic arm. Can you assist me?

It didn't work and I also fried my arduino while trying to make this.

it is not working bro

wow! i like men

bro, you can make a remote controlled submarine with this ! I like it !

it does not work the debugger just has a stroke and the websights no help and says turn of addblocker

Hi, may I ask why I used the code you shared but its not working. What should I do now and have any solution? thank you

So helpful

Hi Cojones, I need to know how you signal the Arduino with 2 different voltages from the laser engraver? Wish to convert into programmed writing pad. Hence the SG 90 servo motor can trigger the up and down movement or I can change the pen to a motorised cutter in future. Thanks.

When I did this project the sensor works and is received but the motor dont move anybody can help?

Bonjour. C'est intéressant mais une chose,  les données de la programmation son illisible. Autres préoccupations. J'aimerais commander un cerveau moteur pour le retournement des oeufs chaque 2 heures dans un incubateur.

I would like to use a servo to control the movement of a jet

I thought servo motors had to use a PWM pin?

I’m thinking about a servo project that will automatically close the lid to a baby wipes container because I always forget to close the lid and the top wipes end up drying out.

Copy paste:void loop()  {   // scan from 0 to 180 degrees   for(angle = 10; angle < 180; angle++)     {                                       servo.write(angle);                    delay(15);                      }    // now scan back from 180 to 0 degrees   for(angle = 180; angle > 10; angle--)       {                                     servo.write(angle);                delay(15);          }  }

Thank You!

I did it but the motor didnt turn

No problem

Thank you so much for helping me out with this tutorial

I'm trying to do the same thing with my arduino UNO and an SC90 servo. When I try to write to the servo it moves slightly and then the arduino crashes and resets. It repeats this forever.  Do I have a bad servo?

VERIIIIII SIMPOLLLLLL ........MY GOD :((((((

can i program a 360 turn servo to spin three times only each direction ?

I am new to arduino and am dissapointed at the obvious missing link. After connecting the servo to the breadboard/Arduino electrically, the video goes straight into the final adjustments of the code but where did the code come from, the library assumably, and how do you know which information, to make the servo work?

Thank you a lot, very good video. perfect for beginners. Described very easy and fast.

Greece is such a lovely country.

I’m building a air powered rocket for my college project. I need this for the parachute release 👌🏾👍🏾👍🏾👌🏾

Thanks

Good day sir. In what component control's the motor rotation.

Bro, es posible dentro de un ciclo for, meter un(if) o sea un condicional para lograr mover dos servomotores al mismo tiempo, y que giren en el mismo sentido los dos?

How does?

Best video i've seen, i mean it! Could never be improved, ever. All the information i needed, basically as quickly as i believe is even possible. Cudos!

Why does he sound like the guy from project night fall

Doesn't running a motor directly off of an arduino damage the board?

I don't know why but my servo is not rotating properly  What may be problem ?

Im going to build a project that turns the lights off for me

sir when i attach arduino to servo it is not sweeping sir plkease tell me what to do

a finger is what i am going to make

Bro this is not working for me ..kindly give some solution to solve this.

#include <Servo.h>  Servo servo;  void setup() {   servo.attach(8);   servo.write(0);   delay(2000); }  void loop() {   servo.write(90);   delay(1000);   servo.write(0);   delay(1000); }

We're building a robo car for our school project. The teacher said to make ours stand out, put a flag on it or something, tune it up, get creative she said. so im turning my one into a tank with the top part rotating like a real tank. :D

i have a problem i want a servo motor to operate in 2 different speeds with 2 diffrent clicks on button  for example normal 120 degree rotation speed at single click and fast 120 degree rotation at double click using on off tactile switch using a cr123a battery.all these using a pcb or arduino in the most smallest space is it possible?

Loved this video! I just have a quick question. I've been surfing the web, and I just can't find the screw size needed to mount the servo arm to the servo itself. Do you know the type of screw/size of the screw needed to do that? I hope you understand. :)

thank you very much it solved my big problem

how much power does this servo consumes in 1 hour... for example if i have 850 mah battery how much time in hours it will work and will servo work on 3v battery

this video was very helpful thank you

Hi, can you show how to sync servo motor with load cell. For example, the servo motor will move when weight below 1kg. Can you show how to do it? I appreciated your help

Thanks for the nice and short video. I'm planning to use a servo-motor to build my time-sensitive pet food-dispenser :)

Happy New Year to you too even though this is four years later lol

Respect. You helped me a lot. The vid was easy to understand, no bullshit at all, straight to the point, exactly what a tutorial should be like. Thank you very much my good sir and have a great day

How to stop the motor

Thank you you made me understand servos in less than a minute :)

I have a seed sowing robot with a wheel dispenser to dispense seeds while spinning. The Wheel Dispenser is attached to the servo motor and how to program it by making it just move forward continuously bcs when the wheel dispenser spins forward in a few seconds, it will spin back reverse to it's original position and move forward again. How to like make the servo motor spin forward forever so seeds won't get reversed back to it's storage funnel.

I am using  this to make chocolate milk stirrer so that I can focus on more important activities.

Would we ever need a separate power supply for the servo motor. The DC motors I use need a separate source, I was wondering if the servo motor also needs one.

Its a very healp full video, you explain very weel, thanks you :3

Hi Nick! Can i  have three servos attached to the same arduino?And how do i have to modify the code in order for every servo to make its move at a different time? Please contact me, i really need some help. Thanks!

Strangely enough, today is 31 December and I watched this video just before the new year. Same to you brother... Why dont you check my channel out

my project is using the servo as the sorter for my conveyor

Very helpful video

for me was missing in code int angle;   :)

Thank you very much useful as a beginner.

I want to start a project about Automatic break system using proximity sensor . I don’t know what kind of motor should i use  . I need a motor that strong enough to pull break wires . Suggestion anyone?

The servo library is already included in your Arduino software.  You just need to go on Sketch -> include library -> Servo.

How??

@galveno6892   change delay(15) to delay(10 or less) in for() loop

I like your accent, good informative video, thanks

really helpful

Thank you for your great beginner vids!!

Για σου ρε ΕΛΛΘΝΑΡΑ!!!!!!!!!!

Why does your For statement stop at 10? Because every servo has a different max/min angle it can go to?

Thanks for this post. It is very interesting project. I think we can make a nice useful project using this servo motor and aruduino UNo. Sometimes we feel, it the speed of a ceiling fan can control with respecting the room temperature. Here we can make it easily. A Temperature Sensor can be used as an input signal of room temp, and a desired Temperature will be set from a android phone through bluetooth. then servo motor will rotate to make the speed regulator to its actual position so that the fan can run with a proper rpm to maintain the desired temperature. I hope you can make it. Thanks with best regards.

Hello, Thank you for your video. Indeed controlling a servo with arduino uno seems very easy. Would it be the same with a 360° rotating servo ?  I plan to build a props for a costume show and the top part (which will be big but lightweigh, max 4 kg) is supposed to rotate 360° non stop. Can you give me some advice, please ?  Thank you in advance.

If you use like that your servo will destroyed!

you can using servo.read(); but its much better to use potentiometer for those kinds of things

Γεια σου φίλε! Ευχαριστώ για τα καλά σου λόγια. Δεν ξέρω να σου απαντήσω σίγουρα. Αν το Drone μπορεί να τροφοδοτήσει το Arduino και το Servo μαζί δεν νομίζω να έχει πρόβλημα. Σκέψου όμως ότι για να δουλέψουν και τα δύο μαζί χρειάζονται αρκετό ρεύμα, περίπου 70-100 mA στα 5V. Αν μπορεί να δώσει τόσο ρεύμα το Drone σε αυτή την έξοδο πιστεύω θα δουλέψει.

ευχαριστω για την γρηγορη απαντηση σου!,να εισαι καλα,πραγματικα βοηθας με τα βιντεο σου,το drone ειναι 11.1 βολτ η μπαταρια του,τελικα ειχες δικαιο!δεν τα δουλεψε και τα δυο,εβαλα μια μπαταρια για την arduino και το ρευμα του drone για το servo!βεβαια οχι οπως θα ηθελα γιατι πρωτη φορα εγραψα κωδικα σε καρτα και εχασα την μπαλα,αλλα θα την κανω την δουλεια μου!ευχαριστω!

Sounds cool!

Thanks ! Hey do you happen to have a tutorial about how to store data from arduino into a MYSQL database to be used in PHP ?

I have made something similar using Raspberry Pi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVGMDYpk5Ds

Thank you so much !

Don't know if you ever got an answer, but a better option would be to use a continuously rotating motor coupled to a scotch yoke or similar mechanism.  Get your repetitious movement from the mechanics, not the electronics.  Then you can simply turn the motor on an off or at different speeds.

@somber_soul  any links to articles to help with this? I'm particularly interested in getting the motion from mechanics and not electronics. I'm thinking it'll help use up the battery, a lot less. Am I correct in my assumptions?

@michaelikechi3790  I am not aware of any particular articles, though a search for scotch yoke on Wikipedia or otherwise yields good results.  Any good book on kinematics will have plenty of examples of mechanisms that convert between rotational and linear motion.  Per the battery question, it would probably depend on how you programmed the accelerations and decelerations.  For instance, if friction is high enough, could you expect friction to stop the wipers if you cut power at position x, thus saving you the energy expended in decelerating the wiper?

Did you find a solution?

I think it is in the delay()

Hello I am building an auto-throttle  & automatic yoke for  microsoft flight simulator. There is a free program that someone made FSUIPC, that has a simple language to interface with keyboard emulator and potentiometers & variable capacitor "real devices" such as seen at www.

Hi. I try to use the sketch but my sg90 continuously rotating, even i'm using the first sketch that you show. Do you have any idea where i did wrong?

maybe because you zainul it

Hair

even mine

Depends on the power source. Normally yes. But if you power your arduino via USB then the 5 volt pin draws directly from the USB and not the micro controller so you can pull whatever..

Yes it is , Arduino is supposed to be for logic. Use a transistor.

Try to use a capacitor as I do in the video

educ8s.tv but you didn't use a capacitor in the vedio.

You are right, check this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TB0F_7SZHg

Same thing happens to me, too. Why is that so ?

Thank you SOOOOO much

Hi, I love your tutorials!  There is a project I have in mind: using a servo for a parking disc which automatically sets the disc one hour forward. It should be not so difficult but the problem would be the little space in the disc and making it bigger would look suspicious

very nice tutorial

I want to make a reward delivery system by attaching arduino servo with opensesame.  If the correct choice is made reward window will open for few seconds.  I dont know how to attach design a sketch for the same. I think it will be more of pyprogramming

thanks youuuuuuu. you are cuteeeeeee.😉

I got a trouble with the sg90 servo when the spin is between 0 to 6 degrees, the spin is correct when is in 0 degrees and if I increase 1 by 1 the spin, the motor is not moving until arrive to 6 degrees, after this angle the servo works properly, anyone have the same problem?

Nice informational and inspirational video, and also liked the photo of Greece mountains. Subscribed to the channel - Good work.

hey dumb fuck the pin 8 is not a pwm pin !!

I am using 4 microservos 9g and a funduino atmega328 .....I am new to this and I cannot find any info on this board on how to call out the plug in connectors for the servos.....the servos I would like to us on single push buttons to move the servo 90 deg forward push again to move the same distance back. and will eventually get it to be wireless button use.

Try linking RPi and arduino together and make a rotating security camera with the camera module and the arduino servo

Happy new year! thank you for your videos!! I just send you an email from your website , hope you answer soon!!   At my robot,  i have attached  the ultrasonic sensor on the servo, so it can turn to many directions, and calculate the closest distance so it can choose which direction has more space to move. It would be a great idea to move this robot using high power stepper motors but i dont know the exact procedure.It would be great if you could share your knowledge with me.

Happy New Years to you too, and thanks for the videos!

A belated Happy New Year Nick.

great video Nick, my suggestion for the next video is using SPI bus by two SPI devices, like an SD card with NRF24 or any other two SPI devices, thanks again, and keep being awesome :D
