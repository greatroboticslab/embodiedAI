[00:00:00.740 → 00:00:06.980] Let's face it, we've all been at one point where an electronic circuit works so well on perfboards
[00:00:07.240 → 00:00:09.360] that you want to build more units of it.
[00:00:09.760 → 00:00:13.500] But creating these solder traces takes up way too much time.
[00:00:14.180 → 00:00:19.440] Or you ogled a new awesome IC that would be perfect for your next project.
[00:00:19.720 → 00:00:26.480] But sadly it does only exist as an SMD package, which makes perfboard soldering pretty hard to do.
[00:00:26.480 → 00:00:39.000] In both cases creating a proper PCB design and ordering it from a PCB manufacturing house is the way to go to save time and play around easily with SMD components.
[00:00:39.880 → 00:00:46.820] So in this video I will be showing you step by step what to look out for when creating the schematic of your project
[00:00:46.820 → 00:00:55.420] and how we can then turn it easily into a PCB design that we can order through a couple of simple clicks for quite a low price.
[00:00:55.420 → 00:00:57.420] Let's get started!
[00:01:09.420 → 00:01:17.640] As a practical example for this video I will be using this relatively simple double-sided PCB that I designed.
[00:01:18.140 → 00:01:20.640] Which brings me to the first step of this tutorial.
[00:01:21.860 → 00:01:23.940] Planning the function of the circuits.
[00:01:23.940 → 00:01:28.620] I knew that I wanted to create a microcontroller based circuit.
[00:01:28.620 → 00:01:35.220] That reads the position of a joystick and then sends the values through the RF band to receiver.
[00:01:35.940 → 00:01:39.780] Also I wanted to power the circuit through a LiPo battery.
[00:01:39.780 → 00:01:47.340] Which means I needed a LiPo charge controller IC, a micro USB port to deliver the power for charging.
[00:01:47.340 → 00:01:52.300] And a power switch to connect the battery voltage to a 3.3V regulator.
[00:01:52.300 → 00:01:58.460] Which converts the unregulated battery voltage into a suitable voltage for the microcontroller.
[00:01:58.460 → 00:02:05.460] Last but not least I wanted to monitor the battery voltage through a voltage divider with the microcontroller.
[00:02:05.460 → 00:02:15.140] So that when the battery voltage gets close to 3.4V the RF functionality shuts down and the yellow LED lights up.
[00:02:15.140 → 00:02:19.820] And with the function of the circuit planned out it was time for step 2.
[00:02:19.820 → 00:02:25.320] Which involves searching for suitable components and creating a paper schematic.
[00:02:25.320 → 00:02:30.000] For component sourcing I like to use LCSC.
[00:02:30.000 → 00:02:32.000] Because their selection is not only big.
[00:02:32.000 → 00:02:37.320] But also because we will be ordering the PCBs through JLCPCB later on.
[00:02:37.320 → 00:02:43.000] And we can combine that with the LCSC order and thus save shipping costs.
[00:02:43.000 → 00:02:47.680] But anyway once I decided on the main ICs.
[00:02:47.680 → 00:02:50.680] Which were the ATMEGA328 as a microcontroller.
[00:02:50.680 → 00:02:54.240] An NRF24 as the RF transmitter.
[00:02:54.240 → 00:02:58.120] A TP4056 as the charge controller.
[00:02:58.120 → 00:03:03.960] And a TPS76933dBVR as the voltage regulator.
[00:03:03.960 → 00:03:06.800] It was time to think about the packages.
[00:03:06.800 → 00:03:11.800] The package basically describes how the IC will physically look like.
[00:03:11.800 → 00:03:17.400] And determines whether it is a THT or SMD component.
[00:03:17.400 → 00:03:23.960] For example while the NRF24 is only available as a breakout board in THT.
[00:03:23.960 → 00:03:28.900] And the TP4056 is only available as an SMD version.
[00:03:28.900 → 00:03:34.280] We do have the choice between THT and SMD for the microcontroller.
[00:03:34.280 → 00:03:37.300] But since I wanted the circuit to be as small as possible.
[00:03:37.300 → 00:03:39.800] I went with the SMD version.
[00:03:39.800 → 00:03:45.400] Which I also set as the standard for the remaining complementary components.
[00:03:45.400 → 00:03:47.400] Next I planned out on a piece of paper.
[00:03:47.400 → 00:03:51.080] How to connect the main ICs to one another.
[00:03:51.080 → 00:03:55.980] And also what passive components are necessary to make them all work.
[00:03:55.980 → 00:03:56.780] To find that out.
[00:03:56.780 → 00:04:00.460] I had a closer look at all the data sheets of the ICs.
[00:04:00.460 → 00:04:03.120] And the recommended example circuits.
[00:04:03.120 → 00:04:06.060] And if everything fails you can always google your question.
[00:04:06.060 → 00:04:11.340] Which should give you a suitable answer in 99% of the cases.
[00:04:11.340 → 00:04:15.940] The last thing to do for the paper circuits was to add breakout points.
[00:04:15.940 → 00:04:18.940] So that I could later program the microcontroller.
[00:04:18.940 → 00:04:22.540] And also hook up the battery and LEDs to the circuits.
[00:04:22.540 → 00:04:24.540] Which will be mounted in a separate enclosure.
[00:04:24.540 → 00:04:28.220] Now for the passive component selection.
[00:04:28.220 → 00:04:32.220] I mainly went with 0603 as the package size.
[00:04:32.220 → 00:04:36.540] Which stands for 0.06 by 0.03 inches.
[00:04:36.540 → 00:04:40.540] Or 1.6 by 0.8 millimeters.
[00:04:40.540 → 00:04:45.820] There also exists a 0402 and a 0201 package.
[00:04:45.820 → 00:04:50.140] But I think 0603 is neither too big or too small.
[00:04:50.140 → 00:04:54.540] And can still be soldered with an iron with a bit of practice.
[00:04:54.540 → 00:04:58.380] And with the component selection and paper schematic being completed.
[00:04:58.380 → 00:05:00.540] It was time for step 3.
[00:05:00.540 → 00:05:03.020] Creating a proper schematic.
[00:05:03.020 → 00:05:07.980] For that I used the EasyEDA free online circuit creator.
[00:05:07.980 → 00:05:10.860] After logging in I created a new project.
[00:05:10.860 → 00:05:13.340] And there a new schematic.
[00:05:13.340 → 00:05:15.820] Then I simply used their online library.
[00:05:15.820 → 00:05:19.660] Which also includes pretty much all LCSC components.
[00:05:19.660 → 00:05:22.300] To search for my utilized components.
[00:05:22.300 → 00:05:24.860] And firstly imported them into the workspace.
[00:05:25.740 → 00:05:28.140] But make sure that you choose components.
[00:05:28.140 → 00:05:30.380] With the right package and correct footprint.
[00:05:31.100 → 00:05:34.540] Otherwise the PCB design will later not work out.
[00:05:34.540 → 00:05:39.420] Once all the main actors of the circuit were imported.
[00:05:39.420 → 00:05:43.340] I then used the left aligned resistors with the right package.
[00:05:43.340 → 00:05:45.660] And capacitors with the right package.
[00:05:45.660 → 00:05:47.820] As the complementary passive components.
[00:05:48.860 → 00:05:50.620] And of course we should not forget.
[00:05:50.620 → 00:05:52.380] To add male header connectors.
[00:05:52.380 → 00:05:53.500] For the breakout points.
[00:05:54.700 → 00:05:57.180] Now that we got all of our required components.
[00:05:57.180 → 00:05:57.980] In the editor.
[00:05:58.620 → 00:06:01.180] We can arrange them to logical blocks.
[00:06:01.180 → 00:06:03.580] Which in my case is the power parts.
[00:06:03.580 → 00:06:05.100] And the microcontroller parts.
[00:06:06.300 → 00:06:07.420] Once that was done.
[00:06:07.420 → 00:06:10.220] I utilized the wire function of the software.
[00:06:10.220 → 00:06:13.020] To connect all the components to one another.
[00:06:13.020 → 00:06:15.420] According to how I planned it out on paper.
[00:06:16.540 → 00:06:17.580] Last but not least.
[00:06:17.580 → 00:06:19.340] I then added the ground.
[00:06:19.340 → 00:06:20.380] VCC.
[00:06:20.380 → 00:06:23.340] And battery voltage supply flags to the schematic.
[00:06:23.340 → 00:06:25.180] Which not only completes it.
[00:06:25.180 → 00:06:28.060] But also ends the third step of this tutorial.
[00:06:28.060 → 00:06:31.580] That means it is time for the last step.
[00:06:31.580 → 00:06:32.620] Step 4.
[00:06:32.620 → 00:06:34.780] Which is PCB design and ordering.
[00:06:35.740 → 00:06:36.460] For that.
[00:06:36.460 → 00:06:39.420] We firstly have to click the convert to PCB button.
[00:06:39.980 → 00:06:42.940] Which automatically throws all the component footprints.
[00:06:42.940 → 00:06:44.380] Into the PCB editor.
[00:06:44.940 → 00:06:47.100] Shows how to connect them through the blue lines.
[00:06:47.660 → 00:06:49.980] And creates a PCB outline for us.
[00:06:51.180 → 00:06:52.620] The first thing I did though.
[00:06:52.620 → 00:06:54.540] Was removing the outline.
[00:06:54.540 → 00:06:56.540] Because as I mentioned earlier.
[00:06:56.540 → 00:06:58.700] I needed a specific PCB size.
[00:06:58.700 → 00:06:59.580] For the enclosure.
[00:07:00.540 → 00:07:01.420] To do that.
[00:07:01.420 → 00:07:03.740] I changed the measuring system to millimeters.
[00:07:04.300 → 00:07:06.700] Selected the board outline layer.
[00:07:06.700 → 00:07:07.980] And used the track tool.
[00:07:07.980 → 00:07:10.380] In combination with the given coordinates.
[00:07:10.380 → 00:07:11.980] In the down right corner.
[00:07:11.980 → 00:07:14.140] To create the correct size for the PCB.
[00:07:15.420 → 00:07:17.740] Then I moved the micro USB port.
[00:07:17.740 → 00:07:19.020] The main power switch.
[00:07:19.020 → 00:07:19.900] And the joystick.
[00:07:19.900 → 00:07:21.580] To the required position.
[00:07:21.580 → 00:07:23.500] According to the enclosure's cutouts.
[00:07:24.700 → 00:07:26.300] To later mount the PCB.
[00:07:26.300 → 00:07:28.380] I also added three pads.
[00:07:28.380 → 00:07:29.900] Whose size I enlarged.
[00:07:29.900 → 00:07:32.220] So that M3 screws would fit through them.
[00:07:33.340 → 00:07:34.620] And with that being done.
[00:07:34.620 → 00:07:37.340] I placed the rest of the components onto the PCB.
[00:07:38.380 → 00:07:39.100] Of course.
[00:07:39.100 → 00:07:41.180] You want to separate the power parts.
[00:07:41.180 → 00:07:42.620] And microcontroller part a bit.
[00:07:43.180 → 00:07:44.380] And also make sure.
[00:07:44.380 → 00:07:46.700] That the pins slash components.
[00:07:46.700 → 00:07:47.980] That need to get connected.
[00:07:47.980 → 00:07:49.260] To one another.
[00:07:49.260 → 00:07:51.180] Are physically close to one another.
[00:07:51.820 → 00:07:53.420] So that the copper trace length.
[00:07:53.420 → 00:07:55.020] Can be as short as possible.
[00:07:56.220 → 00:07:57.420] As soon as you think.
[00:07:57.420 → 00:07:59.180] Your layout looks logical.
[00:07:59.180 → 00:08:01.180] We could use the given auto router.
[00:08:01.180 → 00:08:02.620] To do the wiring for us.
[00:08:03.260 → 00:08:05.500] But as you might already have guessed.
[00:08:05.500 → 00:08:07.500] That is often not the best solution.
[00:08:08.380 → 00:08:10.380] So let's do it manually.
[00:08:10.380 → 00:08:12.460] By selecting the top layer.
[00:08:12.460 → 00:08:13.820] And using the track tool.
[00:08:13.820 → 00:08:15.740] To simply connect all the components.
[00:08:15.740 → 00:08:16.620] To one another.
[00:08:17.340 → 00:08:18.860] But before doing so.
[00:08:18.860 → 00:08:20.460] We have to talk about the width.
[00:08:20.460 → 00:08:21.340] Of the traces.
[00:08:21.980 → 00:08:25.420] Which is usually set to 0.254 millimeters.
[00:08:26.620 → 00:08:29.740] If we use an online trace width calculator.
[00:08:29.740 → 00:08:31.900] And set the ounce value to 1.
[00:08:31.900 → 00:08:33.340] Which is the standard value.
[00:08:33.340 → 00:08:34.860] For JLC PCBs.
[00:08:35.420 → 00:08:36.780] Then the trace could handle.
[00:08:36.780 → 00:08:39.020] Around 0.885 amps.
[00:08:39.020 → 00:08:40.620] Of current on outer layers.
[00:08:41.100 → 00:08:42.060] Which is enough.
[00:08:42.540 → 00:08:44.060] But I always like to work.
[00:08:44.060 → 00:08:46.380] With a width of 0.3 millimeters.
[00:08:47.020 → 00:08:48.060] Since that gives me.
[00:08:48.060 → 00:08:49.580] A maximum of 1 amp.
[00:08:50.620 → 00:08:52.220] And with that out of the way.
[00:08:52.220 → 00:08:54.300] I created all possible connections.
[00:08:54.300 → 00:08:55.580] On the top layer.
[00:08:55.580 → 00:08:56.540] While making sure.
[00:08:56.540 → 00:08:58.780] To not use 90 degree bends.
[00:08:58.780 → 00:09:00.620] Since that is bad practice.
[00:09:00.620 → 00:09:02.620] And everyone in the comment section.
[00:09:02.620 → 00:09:03.340] Will hate you.
[00:09:04.540 → 00:09:05.660] The only problem.
[00:09:05.660 → 00:09:07.340] With this top layer wiring.
[00:09:07.340 → 00:09:09.260] Was that after a short while.
[00:09:09.260 → 00:09:11.340] I was running out of space.
[00:09:11.340 → 00:09:13.180] And not all necessary connections.
[00:09:13.180 → 00:09:13.980] Were made yet.
[00:09:14.860 → 00:09:15.980] But don't worry.
[00:09:15.980 → 00:09:18.140] Since we can switch to the bottom layer.
[00:09:18.140 → 00:09:19.580] And do the rest wiring there.
[00:09:20.220 → 00:09:22.060] Which would be very simple to do.
[00:09:22.060 → 00:09:23.900] For THD components.
[00:09:23.900 → 00:09:24.940] Since the solder pads.
[00:09:24.940 → 00:09:26.540] Penetrate through all layers.
[00:09:27.420 → 00:09:28.940] But for SMD components.
[00:09:28.940 → 00:09:29.900] We have to create.
[00:09:29.900 → 00:09:30.860] A so called via.
[00:09:31.900 → 00:09:32.940] It is basically.
[00:09:32.940 → 00:09:33.980] A small tunnel.
[00:09:33.980 → 00:09:35.100] That connects the top.
[00:09:35.100 → 00:09:35.980] And bottom layer.
[00:09:36.540 → 00:09:37.740] And just like that.
[00:09:37.740 → 00:09:39.260] We can finish the wiring.
[00:09:39.260 → 00:09:40.780] Even for SMD components.
[00:09:40.780 → 00:09:41.740] On the bottom layer.
[00:09:42.780 → 00:09:43.900] Now here is my finished.
[00:09:43.900 → 00:09:45.020] PCB design.
[00:09:45.020 → 00:09:46.380] To which you would answer.
[00:09:46.380 → 00:09:47.900] It is not finished yet.
[00:09:47.900 → 00:09:49.340] Since all ground connections.
[00:09:49.340 → 00:09:50.060] Are not made.
[00:09:51.180 → 00:09:51.740] Well.
[00:09:51.740 → 00:09:52.380] For those.
[00:09:52.380 → 00:09:53.580] We can simply select.
[00:09:53.580 → 00:09:54.860] The top layer.
[00:09:54.860 → 00:09:56.700] And use the copper region tool.
[00:09:56.700 → 00:09:58.460] To encircle the whole PCB.
[00:09:59.500 → 00:10:00.620] And just like that.
[00:10:00.620 → 00:10:02.700] The traces got isolated.
[00:10:02.700 → 00:10:04.860] And the rest of the top layer space.
[00:10:04.860 → 00:10:07.180] Is used as a solid copper ground layer.
[00:10:08.140 → 00:10:08.700] Of course.
[00:10:08.700 → 00:10:09.500] If you want to.
[00:10:09.500 → 00:10:11.260] You could also repeat this process.
[00:10:11.260 → 00:10:12.220] For the bottom layer.
[00:10:13.340 → 00:10:14.300] At this point.
[00:10:14.300 → 00:10:15.500] The PCB design.
[00:10:15.500 → 00:10:16.620] Is basically complete.
[00:10:17.260 → 00:10:17.900] Which means.
[00:10:17.900 → 00:10:18.700] We can click.
[00:10:18.700 → 00:10:20.140] Generate Gerber files.
[00:10:20.140 → 00:10:21.500] In order to download them.
[00:10:21.980 → 00:10:22.300] Or.
[00:10:22.300 → 00:10:23.260] We can directly.
[00:10:23.260 → 00:10:24.700] Order our finished products.
[00:10:24.700 → 00:10:26.220] From JLC PCB.
[00:10:26.940 → 00:10:27.580] Which I did.
[00:10:28.620 → 00:10:30.220] And after waiting for a week.
[00:10:30.220 → 00:10:31.180] I was greeted.
[00:10:31.180 → 00:10:32.220] With 10 copies.
[00:10:32.220 → 00:10:32.860] Of my board.
[00:10:33.420 → 00:10:35.180] Which did not only look promising.
[00:10:35.180 → 00:10:36.700] Under the microscope.
[00:10:36.700 → 00:10:37.660] But also worked.
[00:10:37.660 → 00:10:38.860] Without any problems.
[00:10:39.900 → 00:10:40.140] Now.
[00:10:40.140 → 00:10:41.100] If you're curious.
[00:10:41.100 → 00:10:42.460] How to solder the components.
[00:10:42.460 → 00:10:43.980] To such a PCB.
[00:10:43.980 → 00:10:44.780] Then definitely.
[00:10:44.780 → 00:10:45.260] Make sure.
[00:10:45.260 → 00:10:46.940] To watch my soldering tutorial.
[00:10:46.940 → 00:10:47.980] About the subjects.
[00:10:49.020 → 00:10:49.820] As always.
[00:10:49.820 → 00:10:50.860] I hope you enjoyed.
[00:10:50.860 → 00:10:52.220] Watching this video.
[00:10:52.220 → 00:10:53.660] And learned a thing or two.
[00:10:53.660 → 00:10:54.940] About PCB design.
[00:10:55.900 → 00:10:56.540] If so.
[00:10:56.540 → 00:10:57.900] Don't forget to like.
[00:10:57.900 → 00:10:58.300] Share.
[00:10:58.300 → 00:10:59.020] And subscribe.
[00:10:59.900 → 00:11:01.500] Stay creative.
[00:11:01.500 → 00:11:02.940] And I will see you.
[00:11:02.940 → 00:11:04.060] Next time.
