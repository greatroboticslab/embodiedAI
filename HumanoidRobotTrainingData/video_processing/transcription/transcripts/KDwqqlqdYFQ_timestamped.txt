[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:08.000] Hey, what's happening guys? Yesterday we talked about this class AB amplifier with the TDA2030.
[00:00:08.780 → 00:00:13.300] And today, as promised, we're going to build that circuit.
[00:00:17.760 → 00:00:21.960] So, I've had this kit on my wish list for a while.
[00:00:21.960 → 00:00:30.140] It's from ICStation.com and it's the TDA2030 amplifier kit.
[00:00:33.420 → 00:00:39.200] And I would like to thank Dave for sending it out to us.
[00:00:40.900 → 00:00:46.660] So, we're going to build it and have ourselves a nice TDA2030.
[00:00:46.660 → 00:00:57.780] If we take a look here at the circuit board, you can see there are a few changes from the circuit that I drew yesterday.
[00:00:58.480 → 00:01:05.000] They're using 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 capacitors.
[00:01:07.720 → 00:01:09.180] And my circuit had what?
[00:01:11.560 → 00:01:12.080] 8.
[00:01:12.080 → 00:01:16.960] Then there are also 4 ceramic capacitors.
[00:01:17.560 → 00:01:19.860] So, that's like 13 total capacitors here.
[00:01:24.000 → 00:01:24.560] Yeah.
[00:01:26.060 → 00:01:26.960] So, that's a little different.
[00:01:27.020 → 00:01:28.160] Also, only one diode.
[00:01:31.140 → 00:01:32.480] Which is a little strange.
[00:01:33.480 → 00:01:36.400] But, I think we'll make it work.
[00:01:37.100 → 00:01:37.300] Alright.
[00:01:39.220 → 00:01:39.900] Buckle up.
[00:01:39.900 → 00:01:42.380] We're going to do this fast mode.
[00:01:42.380 → 00:01:42.400] We're going to do this fast mode.
[00:02:09.900 → 00:02:12.460] Now, come on.
[00:02:14.280 → 00:02:16.380] Another time.
[00:02:16.380 → 00:02:17.380] But, let's check on.
[00:02:17.460 → 00:02:18.380] I don't care about Eolt.
[00:02:18.640 → 00:02:18.660] Okay.
[00:02:18.840 → 00:02:19.740] So, we want to do this fast mode.
[00:02:19.840 → 00:02:20.600] And we're going to do it fast pharmacist.
[00:02:20.600 → 00:02:22.260] Doing it fast.
[00:02:22.260 → 00:02:22.920] And we're going to use the cam.
[00:02:23.320 → 00:02:24.340] Today we're going to do it fast debate.
[00:02:24.340 → 00:02:24.660] And what's it mean?
[00:02:24.660 → 00:02:25.060] We're going to do this fast mode.
[00:02:25.060 → 00:02:25.760] I do not want a seat.
[00:02:25.760 → 00:02:26.520] Now, we know the about theünk Ho.
[00:02:26.520 → 00:02:27.780] When I look imbalpsy for some any piece,
[00:02:27.940 → 00:02:29.180] I want to aim for time at the gym.
[00:02:29.360 → 00:02:30.440] So, we will carry you over the profession.
[00:02:30.480 → 00:02:31.680] We're going to do this fast decibels.
[00:02:31.820 → 00:02:33.800] That's super lumico.
[00:02:33.820 → 00:02:35.180] We'll do it fast and see you guys.
[00:02:35.400 → 00:02:36.480] And, and download the Cristo from all across,
[00:02:36.500 → 00:02:37.920] and is the Fi.
[00:02:37.920 → 00:03:07.900] Thank you.
[00:03:07.920 → 00:03:37.900] Thank you.
[00:03:37.920 → 00:04:07.900] Thank you.
[00:04:07.920 → 00:04:09.920] Thank you.
[00:04:09.920 → 00:04:11.920] Thank you.
[00:04:11.920 → 00:04:13.920] Thank you.
[00:04:13.920 → 00:04:15.920] Thank you.
[00:04:15.920 → 00:04:17.920] Thank you.
[00:04:17.920 → 00:04:19.920] Thank you.
[00:04:19.920 → 00:04:24.920] Well, we're just about done.
[00:04:24.920 → 00:04:30.100] The only thing left is this little power jack.
[00:04:31.920 → 00:04:33.000] And, no.
[00:04:33.000 → 00:04:35.000] I don't want to use it.
[00:04:35.000 → 00:04:40.000] I don't like those jacks.
[00:04:40.000 → 00:04:41.000] I don't have anything to use it with.
[00:04:41.000 → 00:04:51.000] So, for our purposes today, I'm just going to cut some wire.
[00:04:51.000 → 00:05:01.000] And, strip it.
[00:05:01.000 → 00:05:04.000] And, we'll just hook it up with alligator clips.
[00:05:04.000 → 00:05:07.000] Now, one thing.
[00:05:07.000 → 00:05:11.000] I just realized.
[00:05:11.000 → 00:05:15.000] These speaker terminals here for bare wire.
[00:05:15.000 → 00:05:17.000] Oh, that's kind of ugly.
[00:05:17.000 → 00:05:19.000] Well, that needs fixed.
[00:05:19.000 → 00:05:20.000] Well, that needs fixed.
[00:05:20.000 → 00:05:21.000] Yeah.
[00:05:21.000 → 00:05:26.000] I don't have any speakers that hook up like that.
[00:05:26.000 → 00:05:29.000] So, before we can really test this out.
[00:05:29.000 → 00:05:30.000] Good.
[00:05:30.000 → 00:05:40.000] I need to get a hold of a couple of speakers of that ilk.
[00:05:40.000 → 00:05:43.000] I will grab some tomorrow.
[00:05:43.000 → 00:05:50.000] I think if I go up to my mom's house, there might be some old stereo speakers from when
[00:05:50.000 → 00:05:51.000] I was a boy.
[00:05:52.000 → 00:05:55.000] So, we can go check that out.
[00:06:00.000 → 00:06:01.000] Okay.
[00:06:01.000 → 00:06:04.000] Last soldering for this guy.
[00:06:04.000 → 00:06:08.000] It took me about an hour to put this together.
[00:06:08.000 → 00:06:11.000] Aren't you glad I condensed it?
[00:06:11.000 → 00:06:12.000] Alright.
[00:06:12.000 → 00:06:15.000] So, the piece de resistance.
[00:06:15.000 → 00:06:32.000] There we go.
[00:06:32.000 → 00:06:33.000] Nice.
[00:06:33.000 → 00:06:34.000] So, let's smoke test it.
[00:06:34.000 → 00:06:37.000] We'll hook it up to 12 volts.
[00:06:37.000 → 00:06:44.000] And hopefully, the only thing that lights up is the LED.
[00:06:44.000 → 00:06:45.000] I got that set for 6 volts.
[00:06:45.000 → 00:06:47.000] Let me get in here and change it.
[00:06:47.000 → 00:06:48.000] Voltage.
[00:06:48.000 → 00:06:49.000] Boom, boom.
[00:06:49.000 → 00:06:50.000] Zip.
[00:06:50.000 → 00:06:51.000] Boom, boom.
[00:06:51.000 → 00:06:52.000] Zip.
[00:06:52.000 → 00:06:53.000] Boom, boom.
[00:06:53.000 → 00:06:55.000] And I got that set for 6 volts.
[00:06:55.000 → 00:07:11.560] lights up is the LED. I got that set for 6 volts let me get in here and change it.
[00:07:11.560 → 00:07:28.800] Voltage boom boom zip and power. Okay so our LED is lit sniff testing
[00:07:28.800 → 00:07:42.300] nothing seems unreasonably hot
[00:07:42.300 → 00:07:57.540] yeah I guess I soldered everything in the right direction then power that down
[00:07:57.540 → 00:08:04.440] now I don't know if you could see it in the video because it went so fast but I
[00:08:04.440 → 00:08:12.180] put thermal grease in between those TDA 2030s and the heat sinks get these on
[00:08:12.180 → 00:08:20.280] eBay just put in thermal paste you get like 10 syringes for two dollars or
[00:08:20.280 → 00:08:29.280] something ridiculous like that. Alright so anyway there's our amplifier that's all
[00:08:29.280 → 00:08:34.860] we can do for tonight we will do the rest when I pick up a pair of speakers to test
[00:08:34.860 → 00:08:49.860] it with and instead of just shoving some audio through it I think what we might do
[00:08:49.860 → 00:09:10.200] is hook up this AD9833 digital synthesis chip and put some different frequencies through it
[00:09:10.200 → 00:09:14.820] you know we hook that up to the Arduino and we can sweep it through some different frequencies
[00:09:14.820 → 00:09:19.980] and we'll put it on a scope and look at the output. So if you guys want to see that
[00:09:19.980 → 00:09:25.380] give me the old thumbs up feel free to comment share and don't forget to subscribe.
[00:09:25.380 → 00:09:30.880] That's it I'm out peace except the Ravens
[00:09:30.880 → 00:09:31.880] you
[00:09:31.880 → 00:09:33.880] you
