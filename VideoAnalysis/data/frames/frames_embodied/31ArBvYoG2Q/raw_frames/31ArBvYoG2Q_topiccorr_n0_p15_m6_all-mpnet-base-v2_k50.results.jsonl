It was a full- on beginner's guide that walked through everything without making my head spin. They showed how to wield a soldering iron like a pro, with a nod to some seriously cool tools, like that on-the- go soldering iron and the hex drivers that look like they'd last a lifetime. It was all about getting the details right, from sticking the ESCs in the right spot to making sure the motor wires were not just connected but looking neat too. And the tips on installing the wires, popping on the capacitor, and getting the receiver hooked up to the flight controller were gold – clear, concise, and totally doable. They even made sure to point out how to tuck in the camera, VTX, and receiver so they'd stay put. I'm feeling pretty good about putting together a Tyro69 that's solid and looks clean, with no solder drama on the flight controller and everything else in its perfect place. Plus, the final look with the 20x20 stack is just sweet. All in all, it's a solid guide that could be very helpful If I wanted to make one of these in the future.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31ArBvYoG2Q: “Beginner Guide // How To Build Budget Micro FPV Drone kit 2019 - Eachine Tyro69”"}]}
