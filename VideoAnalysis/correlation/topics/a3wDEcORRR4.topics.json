      "coverage_text": "Now let's take a look at how we can go from something like this fairly robust breadboard\nwith nice cleaned up wires to something even more robust, something that we can implement,\nsay, in a robot that's moving around or on your bicycle or in a car or an industrial application\nor something, or just the fact that you want to pass it around and let people play with this\nprototype, right? These wires can get loose eventually, they corrode, they make misconnections,\nit's just not the best long-term solution. So what we use is PerfBoard, and PerfBoard is perforated\nboard that you cut to whatever size you want, and you hardwire solder all those connections in place.\nThere's lots of different kind. This one is like a single point PerfBoard. Some of them have\nrows that are all connected, similar to like a breadboard and how that's connected.\nI like these, they're one-sided, and they have individual copper pads on each hole, and I'll show\nyou briefly how I would use it. This video is more about some tips and techniques more than actually\nbuilding something on a PerfBoard. It's fairly straightforward, but I've got some things that\nshould help you build it. Number one, size. Don't necessarily want this size of a PerfBoard.\nI want something smaller. Maybe I'm creating a little board that breaks out all the analog pins",

You can use little nippers,\nyou can use some scissors. Don't bother. I see lots of people doing that. You get jagged edges.\nIt's not the best way. Best thing you can do, go get some really cheap tin snips. Make sure you buy\nwhether you buy a right-handed or left-handed version. But look at this. If I were to take\nthis PerfBoard, or actually I have one here cut down already, and I were to just cut a row off of this,\nI mean it cuts so easily. It leaves a nice clean edge, very little sharp corners. I mean it's just,\nit's really nice. And if I wanted, say, a little breakout board from my Arduino, I can actually\njust cut the board like that. And look at that. I've got this great little breakout board that I\ncould solder some header pins in and put it on my Arduino. Couldn't really be easier. So that's\nnumber one, cutting. Number two, soldering.

I still actually remember one time I was making an Arduino many, many years ago. I want\nto say like close to 10 years ago. And I soldered my AT Mega, I don't remember, I think it was a 168\nmicrocontroller in there. And I fried it. And once I soldered it in, I go to unsolder it. It was a mess.\nIt was horrible. Don't put your microcontrollers or integrated circuits, don't solder them directly to\na board. Use something like a socket. And this is a socket. And what this allows you to do is put it\ninto PerfBoard, solder this in from the backside. And then I can take my microcontroller and I can\nsnap it into the socket. Something happens, I can pop it out. If I change my code, I can actually have\non the side a couple of different microcontrollers with different codes. It's really great for demoing.\nIt's great for having a backup. So that's one thing. Another thing to know is when soldering to\nthe PerfBoard, and I'll grab my soldering iron real quick to show you. And you know what, I'm going to\nmake a quick note about this soldering iron. This is my used industrial grade MetCal soldering iron.",

It's basically like a radio antenna, believe it or not,\nthat from my understanding excites the tip of the soldering iron and heats it up extremely fast. I love\nthis soldering iron. They're hundreds of dollars new, but you can go to eBay and buy them used for,\nI think I paid under a hundred bucks for this. And what I like about it is if I go to turn it on,\nI've just turned my soldering iron on.\nAnd let these little brass there, let's see. There you go. It's already up to temperature.\nI mean, what was that? A couple of seconds? Love it. It actually cools down just as fast.\nBut what I wanted to show you is let's say we were going to solder this header pin in here.\nI push it through from this side.\nAnd I can get in here and get a nice little blob of solder on my soldering iron.\nI can tack it in place real quick.\nAnd now that's tacked in place, right? But this is what I wanted to get at.\nWhen working with PerfBoard, these are incredibly valuable.\nThis is a rosin flux pen. And what this does is it cleans and is a facilitator for the solder to flow.\nSo if I'm going to go in here, you can see the PerfBoards typically are a little,\nI don't want to say messy, but they're not exactly the cleanest of all things.\nAnd with a little flux pen, it makes soldering so much easier.\nTrust me on this one.
