so this is the Mitac when you open it there's the Mitac spread board and then it should come with a paper uh it's like an envelope with papers the manuals and stuff you have these three cables and this piece here you have the pieces which are here and the terminal connector is i put it in this bag essentially you don't need the audio cables so you can just put this aside there are two links that you have to go to and this is where you find the zero number but i will tell you personally the zero number is located right here it says sn zero number this is the first website and this is how you download it basically you have it on all the last test settings except this 32-bit is fine english or whatever you prefer and just click download downloading the package manager after you follow the steps you just make an account and it'll do all of this you just agree uh there's lab view and basically everything that you need it's already pre-selected you click next this is the software bundle i always agree you want to read it read it just click next until it finishes and maybe we will finish now now we have all of this here for the my doc if you are looking to calculate voltage you plug the red cable right here otherwise if you want to calculate the current you plug it in here the black one always goes to the black spot and then this one really it depends just plug it in we'll make it snug this is kind of tricky this is an up close shot of how it looks these are looking up and just but you gotta press it hard until it kind of clicks make sure it's really tight don't be afraid and that's it this is where you would connect all the cables and stuff now we plug one end of the usb cable and the actual usb cable goes to your computer this shows up as soon as you plug it in now go to the bottom and click on launch instruments and apps for this device this should pop up and now you have all of this that you will use throughout the course with this you can access the digital multimeter for example the dc level a very important feature is that n i launcher which should download through computer so my launcher which will be this and here is the n i registration wizard that the papers here talk about just follow the instructions and that's where you register everything and then it should work now so now we'll show you how it works now once you input your information this would happen so you click yet register i mean it knows that you're connected to this one for example and then yeah use web browser just register just keep clicking yes until it stops asking you for more stuff um yeah register a product so you put the zero number now that i put the serial number this shows up uh registration is in progress so now we need to wait now we've waited a little while we reload this and we can see let's see it's still loading we can active software right the activation process is right here uh we already got our zero number since you know we already did this process it already knows um now we can actually activate it i have created a simple circuit which is just positive goes around a resistor and comes back negative positive starts from zero ao zero to the yellow to the positive line that is connected the whole way here horizontally and the negative is also all the way up to here connected horizontally uh below the spread board so we start at yellow goes to the green goes to the resistor goes back to the blue and goes through the negative to the orange back to ground a ground would be negative and this is exactly what is going on here now if we want to calculate for example the current that goes through this resistor this is what we would do first let's say we have one cup voltage in here in the dc level output which you can find over here multimeter dc level you put one you start it up it's running you start up this which is already running for me remember to put it in the current click run and set this to the current this is voltage this is current set it to the current and now all we have to do this does depend on which one goes first so we're going to put the positive side red and the negative side black so we put it right here like so right there on each end and we can see a positive two milliamps and it might be a little volatile depending on you know the accuracy of this thing but if you take it off it's here and if you put it backwards like so this is extremely hard to do with one hand important thing to point out is that you cannot do this a resistor cannot go just through its own line you short the circuit here this makes more sense you got to put it on at least the next one just a different one the next one or even in the next section this right here symbolizes a break so you can definitely do this switch from one side to another side you can't just do it on the same side the same line you'll short the circuit or it will be unnecessary if you do it with something like a regular jump wire you want to change it from one to another you unscrew a little bit you change it and say back to this one where we wanted it and push it a little bit and we just righty tighty lefty losing and this is tight and we can work on it that's how you do it it's pretty simple this comes with the breadboard and the my deck and everything else most of the information you will be asked shows over here you know obviously you cannot just read from this because the graph is not very accurate you have to look at this uh there's times you're gonna look at this and there's times you're gonna look at this so just letting you know what is it you're looking for when looking at this grass also when you want to access the main panel you will look at it from here and touch this button and it'll appear once again if you don't know how to go back to this you don't have to unplug and plug back again don't like that you go to instruments and it will appear back again also we're going to be using at the very end the bottom analyzer boat analyzer yeah this so basically now i'm going to show you exactly an example of how you would use this in an in an assignment so now i'm going to show you how to use the boat analyzer oh sorry um um basically you're going to be given the resistor the resistance um the capacitor all the values for that the start frequency and the stop frequency if you go back over here let's pull this if you go back over here you can see start frequencies right here it's 10 in this example and then 20k uh for stop frequency and peak amplitude will stay at 2 and all we have to do is make this a small circuit following this small diagram so we have two grounds a capacitor uh the vo which is the voltage uh this must be v in and a resistor and this is in the middle of the resistor and the capacitor such as we can see here uh so this is resistor capacitor and uh the v oh i mean we could also get a different with this uh my recommendation is just try different things uh it's not that hard you just gotta play with it a little bit uh we have your regular ground connected to the other grounds uh here through this you have uh the vo right here in the middle like we said the vo in the middle and the v in right here next to this uh ground which goes to zero plus now we just run it after we have all the values input so when we run it we can see um perhaps a sort of similar graph to last time it did change a little bit but uh not entirely values were given here perfectly and this is what you have to input in the and for the answers once you do all of this these are the values that you're looking for right here in the x and y axis use these two that go together uh this is further down the class but this is an up amp which basically is this little triangle here so it goes this way there's a little circle that you might be able to see in the camera yep and so you identify which is one and which is two so it's one two three four five six seven right this would be eight in theory but yeah so this is two is three this is four this is six this is seven and that is how you look at it you might be wondering where's eight and five well yes they're here so more questions thank you now we're gonna go ahead and assume that this is vcc uh not assume but we're gonna assume that vcc is 15. vcc would be this one and this would be vee we're giving 15 which is exactly what is shown right here and we're gonna then assume that the v in and vo are two volts now when you go here in the function generator you see that you have the amps here's where you put two it's the same function that we use here but we don't use this because they you overwrite the system we only use this that has two in one so we say two and then we say let's say let's say 100 as depicted here we're gonna have 100 and we're gonna run it we're also gonna run this this is just the measures this is uh the scale which one is fine and this is a one zero now this is where it gets complicated because a one zero is right here it's a new concept we're looking at this is a one this is zero zero plus will go according to this two the cv plus is going to number three we can see it right here this is v in that would be and that would be number three right here one two three and this is that one which goes to a zero a negative and one negative go to the negative which is connected through here to a ground perfect and that is how we get this now we have once you run it we have this you just zoom out a little bit and you will start getting a better shape now these numbers are going to be given i'm just showing you where to plug in plug them in anyways yep that's basically it and then you can when you have two of these two up amps you can select this and then enable it and make another whole circuit in the other side but for now we're just going to leave it at one because you get the basics you chance to do everything again but for this side now this resistor for example is going from two to two to six as we can see so we go two resistor six this is two resistor then six after the six we can see there's a vo and this is where vo comes in over here at a one zero and then this a one one plus is the one that we named which was over here and three which is this one and this right here means ground ground ground is connected right here so you don't really need to connect the two number three per se here i can move a one uh which is also connected even though we have another up amp for example this problem so this is ground you have a grounded with the other ones uh which will be the negative spots over here in a1 that's basically how you set up this you just follow the instructions uh they tell you the frequency the voltage and the setup you might have more resistors there might be a little bit more of a mess here but this is basically the basics and with this you can work on the future just add whatever they ask you so this should get you started on this those are the basics you should be ready there are other implications uh to using these and it's not so straightforward just putting one end here and one end here and you got it sometimes you need to do a little bit different stuff but you will learn that in the course so good luck and this is the end of the super tutorial too
