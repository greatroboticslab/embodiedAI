So for the demonstration purpose I am using\nDST22 temperature and humidity sensor and LDR sensor but you can also use DST11 sensor which is more\ncheaper. This is a 7 inch Dwin HMI touch display here you can monitor the temperature humidity",

This project is a local area network based project in which\nyou don't need an active internet connection to control and monitor your home appliances.\nHere I am configuring the ESP32 web server in soft app mode.

      "coverage_text": "During this video I have shared a complete circuit diagram, Arduino source code, doing display GUI designing\nprocess etc. So you can easily make this project at your home.\nAlthough you can make this project easily using ESP32 relay module, DHT sensor and LDR sensor but it is better to use\ncustom PCB for this project to avoid any loose connection. So I have designed a custom PCB for this project.\nYou can go to the download links to download the project Gerber file and order the PCB directly from\npcbware.com. pcbware.com is one-stop solution for your all the PCB needs like PCB prototyping,\nSMD stencil, PCB assembly, etc. Currently they have moved to a new factory and offering you up to 20%\ndiscount on 4 layer PCB and 6 layer PCB. PCBWare provides high quality material TG150 to 160 but keeps the same\nprice with TG130 to 140. So get your first prototype PCB ready from pcbware.com.\nThe link is in the description below. Just click on the PCB instant code tab then click on quick order PCB.\nNow upload your Gerber file. Select your preferred shipping method and place your order.\nNow let's assemble all the components and for that you have to connect the GST22 or GST11 sensor,\nLDR sensor and the relay module to the ESP32 board. So first we interface the sensor and then relays and\nmake a serial communication to the display using RX2 and TX2 pins on the display module. Now connect the\nsensor relay module and doing HMI display to the ESP32 as shown here. Also provide the AC source to your home\nappliances as shown in the circuit diagram. Now let us visit the official website of dwingglobal.com.\nYou can see the Dwing company making a wide range of high quality touch screen for android LCD, HDMI LCD and\nLinux LCD display. Under the download section go to the tools and download the DGUS Dwing graphic\nutilized software that is DGUS software and XR21X driver. The driver is for HDL662B board. We don't need to\ninstall this DGUS software. Under this DGUS folder you can see some executable files which includes tools\nlike ICL tool, front generating tool, image resizing tool etc. inside this DGUS software.\nInside XR21X folder there are the driver files. You need to install the driver on your PC to establish\nthe communication between HDL662B and your PC. Double click the executable file to launch the\ndriver installer. Now click on the install to install the driver on your windows PC.\nAfter installing the DGUS software and the driver open the DGUS.exe file. By default the software\nlanguage is in Chinese. So go to the settings and change it to English. Now click on new to create a new\nproject. Select the screen resolution of 800 by 480 pixels. Choose your project folder path.\nIn this demonstration I am creating a new folder doing smart home and selecting the same folder path.\nNow you need to prepare images for your project. Here I have already created images and icons for my\nproject. You can name your project images and icon folder as 32, 42, 46, 56, 58, 62, 64 and so on.\nBecause we need to create an ICL file of these pictures later and memory is divided into different section.\nIn this tutorial under 32 folder I have placed images of my UI. Make sure that your image resolution is 800 by 480 pixels\nand is in .bmp format. Under the 46 folder I have placed icon files. Similarly on the 62 folder I have placed the\nnumber icon files. Now add your project images from 32 folder. Here I have a single image. We should create",
