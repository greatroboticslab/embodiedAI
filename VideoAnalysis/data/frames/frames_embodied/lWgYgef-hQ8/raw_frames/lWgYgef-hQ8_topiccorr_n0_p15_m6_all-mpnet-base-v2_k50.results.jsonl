Using the three mosfets and the pot to control a cd rom motor was really interesting. The oscilloscope shows how smooth the motor was running and he could even increase the speed to a very high RPM.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWgYgef-hQ8: How to make 12v chaser lamps circuit , mosfet , irfz 44n"}, {"correlated": false, "score": 10, "reason": "The comment discusses MOSFET-based projects and chaser lamps, which has no direct relation to the topic of repeated answers. The only overlap is a vague mention of unanswered questions, but it does not explicitly discuss the lack of new information.", "comment": "The video included useful examples of MOSFET-based projects like chaser lamps.Any questions not answered through the video: The video only had music and lacked explanations of theory or calculations.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWgYgef-hQ8: How to make 12v chaser lamps circuit, MOSFET, IRFZ44N"}]}
