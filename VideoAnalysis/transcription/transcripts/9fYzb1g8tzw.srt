00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello and welcome to the video. This is a quick video on this new quad from Darwin FPV.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,020
This is the CineApe 25. Now I've looked at a few other quads from Darwin FPV and I'm always

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,620
impressed because unlike some of the other people out there making these kind of ready-to-fly things,

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:26,380
the Darwin FPV stuff is a little bit less expensive. So it's kind of in the price range

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,040
of a lot more pilots but they do put a lot of thought and love into these things and this

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,760
25 is the latest one. So I thought I'd get it in and we'll have a go. Now this is available in a

7
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,540
couple of different versions. It comes with Walksnail and I've got the analog version here.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,800
So it's been a while since I've reviewed an analog quad but lots of you pilots out there I know

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:55,200
are still flying analog. Other 60% of all my viewers last time we did a poll are still flying analog and

10
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,620
waiting for digital HD and maybe making a choice in the spring. So let me unbox this and go through

11
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,580
the specs, talk about some of the cool stuff. Let's give it a fly and see what it's like.

12
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,200
So the big thing with this is this is like that kind of big whoop style where it has a high strength

13
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,500
one-piece injection molded prop guard. Very useful because it means that you can bounce off stuff.

14
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,400
I've been very happy flying much closer into obstacles with this knowing that if I hit something

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,900
it's just going to bounce off it rather than destroy a prop potentially snap an arm. Battery life claimed

16
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,660
on this is up to nine minutes. We'll see what that is in a moment. I think nine minutes is optimistic,

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,420
gentle flying potentially without any kind of action camera installed. So again this is the Darwin FPV

18
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:46,640
Cine Ape 25. It's an X style layout. Six bladed props. Wheelbase is 112 millimeters. Dimensions of this

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,020
thing isn't particularly big. It's a nice size for flying around large indoor environments and also

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:02:00,460
flying outside as well. So it's about 160 by 160 by 43 millimeters. Flight controller on this is an F411

21
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:09,480
base thing and it does have 30 amp 3 to 4S ESCs. I'm running mine on 4S here. Again as I said in the

22
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:15,100
introduction this happens to be the analog version. Comes with a Caddx ant. Not a fan of the ant

23
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:20,660
unfortunately but we'll see how it performs here in a moment with a 600 milliwatt analog VTX. But

24
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,180
incitingly there is also a HD version which is the Caddx walk snail one which comes with the Avatar

25
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:33,360
Mini 1S that I looked at recently which is a nice unit and I'm tempted maybe to put my one of those

26
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:44,860
in here. Motors are 1504 3600 kV and those propellers are HQ prop T63 MMX6 propellers. Recommended

27
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:52,420
battery for this is an 850 milliamp power 4S pack. They reckon you'll get about nine minutes hovering

28
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,420
time. Realistically I think you're going to get a little bit less and I'll talk about what I got.

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,020
I'm using a slightly smaller battery to make it a little bit more nimble. I'm using a 650 milliamp

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:09,240
power battery rather than the recommended 850. So let's have a very quick look at the configuration.

31
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:16,420
Now I can plug it into the computer. Again diff and dump going to be down below. So let's first of all

32
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:21,520
plug the thing in and turn on expert mode. Have a quick look at the tabs. Ports are configured for

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,100
this so the only thing we have is the serial receiver. I've got mine running on SBUS which is

34
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,980
how it comes by default. Mine didn't come with a receiver and we've also got smart audio for the VTX as

35
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:40,440
well. Configuration 8k gyro 4k pid loop frequencies. CPU load is pretty high running about 52% there at

36
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,060
the bottom but then it's an F4 base flight controller. This is how it's set up. Pretty standard stuff here.

37
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:54,680
Power and battery is set like this. Seems to work okay. Failsafe is set to drop which is what you want.

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:02,840
Pid tuning as you'll see in a moment from the flying is very relaxed and gentle but for a kind

39
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,560
of a filming mini quad like this that's exactly what you want. Although you can get quite a turn

40
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,360
of speed out of this thing it can hoop around when you need to. Receiver again set for SBUS by default.

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,500
This is how it comes. You could also set it up for other stuff as well but the little cable that comes

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,700
on it is kind of designed to be plugged or soldered onto an SBUS receiver. Modes are set like this. I

43
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,340
would definitely come in here and play with the modes. This is a slightly unusual way to do it.

44
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,620
Basically auxiliary one arms it and puts it into angle so they're not expecting you to use horizon

45
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,320
even though you can flip and roll. On-screen display looks like this. I'd definitely come in here and move

46
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,860
things around. Everyone has their own particular way of doing it. Video transmitter for my analog version

47
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,220
here is all set up and the tables all loaded. It's pretty much ready to rock and roll. Again dump and

48
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:04,900
diff are down below if you want to go and have a look. In terms of flying. Flying is an awful lot of fun.

49
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,840
The noise level from those multi-related props is a little bit higher than I would like. It's very very

50
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,440
kind of a high wind buzz which does mean that even when it's a reasonable distance away from you

51
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,400
you can still hear it and if you blip the throttle then everyone in the field that you're in is going to hear it as well.

52
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,700
But it does give it quite a little bit of punch. Hovering at below 50% throttle and I'm getting about

53
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:36,660
four and a half minutes out of a 650 milliamp hour pack without an action camera. I'm getting just under

54
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,240
four minutes with an action camera. Something like a peanut or something like the Runcam Thumb Pro on the nose.

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,420
Obviously you're going to get a little bit more flight time if you use that 850 milliamp hour pack

56
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,640
that's recommended. Tune is nice and gentle as we've already looked at and it does have the ability

57
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,580
for crisp rolls and flips if you really want to. I don't think that's what it's designed for but it

58
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,480
does show you how nimble it can be if you want to fly it in horizon or rate mode to get some more

59
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,240
aggressive filming in tighter spaces where those protected props are going to come in handy.

60
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,880
The one thing that's letting it down is unfortunately the image from that Caddx Ant.

61
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,780
I kind of already alluded to this but I'm not a fan of the Caddx Ant. I don't think it's a particularly

62
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,500
good camera. I don't think that it does a great job and it's performing in exactly the same way here

63
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:33,500
on this model. So for me if I was getting one of these I would probably swap that out with something

64
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,500
else or ideally I think the walks now version of this would be my preferred version and it's going to

65
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,840
be a little bit more expensive but walks now in that 1S kit is going to give you a much nicer view

66
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,620
and allow you to fly very close to and around stuff while still being able to see it clearly.

67
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,180
You can see here that even though I'm flying around the goal posts I'm not really getting a clear view

68
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:02,100
until I'm pretty close and if I'm moving at speed I'm already going to hit it before I can correct and

69
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,240
get out of the way. There is also a little bit of noise from the VTX here and there is a cap

70
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,760
fitted already so they have obviously tried to sort that out but there is a little bit of

71
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,900
interruption and problem with noise. So there's a lot of things that I like here. I like the size,

72
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,900
I like the design, I like the optional foam bumper strip that can go around the outside that comes in

73
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,380
the box. That means if you are flying it indoors and you bump into stuff not only you're not going to

74
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,120
damage the quad you're also not going to damage the thing you've bumped into. Easy to get this under

75
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:41,300
250 grams if that's important to you. With my 650 gram battery and the model itself I'm getting under

76
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,640
250. Now in lots of places as soon as you add a camera the whole 250 limit kind of becomes a moot

77
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,880
point but if that's important to you it's good to know that you can. There is obviously a room for a

78
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,000
small action camera at the front. Again it's not a massive amount of room and it doesn't have a huge

79
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,060
carrying capacity so Runcam Thumb Pro or something like Yucadex Peanut would be my go-tos for this.

80
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,700
Also quite a fan of the fact that they're not asking ridiculous money for this. The price of

81
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,100
everything has gone up thanks to all the issues that we've had over the past two or three years

82
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,400
and it does mean that more pilots can afford to get their hands on a nicely built well put together

83
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,540
model like this. I do like the fact that they've also made the frame very easy to take apart

84
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:29,580
just with one hex driver you can kind of take out a handful of screws and the whole kind of middle

85
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:34,800
tower drops out which gives you access to everything if you want to play around.

86
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,200
But even though the onboard USB connector for the flight controller is hidden away inside the model

87
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,340
you don't have to take it apart in order to plug it in. They're very cleverly thought of that and

88
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,240
there is a USB-C connector hidden away here at the front of the model underneath where you would

89
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,440
mount an action cam. Just peel back the rubber grommet and you can plug it into your computer and do the

90
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,600
configuration from here. That's a really smart design decision. So there's only a couple of

91
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,140
things to be aware of with this. First of all I'm not a fan of the FPV performance in this analog setup.

92
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,320
The HD FPV option would be my choice or potentially replacing that Caddx ant with something else.

93
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,740
It is wired for SBUS by default and lots of pilots will want to put CRSF on there so maybe that should

94
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,740
be a consideration for Darwin FPV when they're building these things in future give you that

95
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,160
option. It has a linear antenna at the back so be aware of that. Ideally what you want are linear

96
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,780
antennas on your goggles. I think for the extra weight I'd personally preferred some form of very

97
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:45,120
small lollipop style circular polarized. And those six blades do make for quite a high whine and quite an

98
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,660
inefficient creation of thrust. It does keep the model nice and small but it does mean that you get

99
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:56,000
shorter flight times and there is that extra little bit of noise as you're flying around. And the other

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,880
thing of course is that unfortunately although Darwin FPV are obviously working very hard to keep the price

101
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:07,340
within the range of most pilots because the price of the components going up the price of this stuff

102
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:14,240
is as well. So in summary this is a very nice little quad. This is a great option if you want to have

103
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,920
something that you can fly around outside, fly around indoors. The setup's really nice. The only

104
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,800
thing that's letting this down is the performance of that FPV setup. Thank you for spending your time
