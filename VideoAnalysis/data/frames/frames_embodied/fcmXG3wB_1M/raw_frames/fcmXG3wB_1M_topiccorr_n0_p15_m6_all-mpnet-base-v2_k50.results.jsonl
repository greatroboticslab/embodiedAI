He used the oscilloscope to show the square wave pattern and first being very choppy, then getting smoother as the camera distance was changed. After focusing the camera, he was able to connect the board to an old tv to get a visual signal. The board does not look to complicated with the capacitors and resistors soldered on it. The heart seems to be in the compact camera with attached boards already on it that are doing most of the signal conversion.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcmXG3wB_1M: How to Make Video Transmitter - Make Your Own Television Transmitter"}]}
