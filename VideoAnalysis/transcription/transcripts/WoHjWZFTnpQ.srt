00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
Hey everybody, this is Tristan from Easy Drone, and in today's tutorial, I'm going to be teaching you guys how to fly an FPV drone.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:12,020
From everything from the different modes, to how the modes work, from what the sticks do, to flying the drone. So, let's dive in.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,560
Alright, so the first thing that we need to learn is how our sticks actually work.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:22,980
So, on the left-hand side right here, we have a stick that centers in the middle, but it'll stay wherever you put it.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,960
And that's our throttle and yaw stick.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,420
So, the throttle will make the drone go up and down, and then the yaw will make the drone spin side to side like this.

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,940
On the other side of our controller, we have our pitch and roll stick.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,060
Now, this one centers to the middle every time, so if you let go of it, it'll always go to the middle.

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,160
And with this right-hand stick, if we tilt it forwards, the drone will tilt forwards.

10
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,200
Backwards, it'll tilt backwards.

11
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,020
If we tilt it to the right, the drone will also tilt to the right.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,740
Same thing with left, any sort of diagonal turn.

13
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,920
Wherever you move this stick, the drone will also tilt in that direction.

14
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,680
So, again, a quick little overview.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,340
We have throttle, yaw, that's spinning side to side.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,160
And then we have tilt stick.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,920
This is our pitch stick going up and down.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,820
And then this is going to be our tilt stick, our roll stick going left to right.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,700
So, now that we've went over what the sticks on our controller do, let's talk about flight modes.

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
So, there's three main flight modes.

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,220
There is horizon mode, angle mode, and acro mode.

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,640
Now, horizon mode sucks.

23
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,460
It's hard to master.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,480
No one ever does it.

25
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,700
And it's inconsistent.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,260
So, I'm not even going to talk about it today.

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,880
If you want to learn about it, I did put information about it on my article, which is linked down below.

28
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,620
So, angle and acro mode.

29
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,680
Angle mode is the easiest for people to learn.

30
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,060
I always start people off by teaching them angle mode.

31
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,540
The throttle and the yaw are always the same.

32
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,100
So, our left stick here, our throttle and the yaw are always going to be the same, no matter if it's angle or acro mode.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,780
So, what I'm going to be focusing on right now is our right stick, our pitch, and our roll.

34
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,080
When we pitch the drone forwards in angle mode, it's only limited to a certain height.

35
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:54,880
And wherever you put the stick, if I have the stick right here, I put it halfway forwards.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
The drone is going to tilt halfway of its range limit.

37
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,660
And if I push it all the way forwards, it's going to tilt all the way forwards.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,940
So, if this drone can only tilt 30 degrees in any given direction, and if I push my stick halfway to the top, the drone is going to tilt 15 degrees.

39
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,400
And if I push it all the way, it's going to tilt 30 degrees.

40
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,480
So, the stick's always in the middle.

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,520
So, if I pull it down halfway, the drone would tilt back 15 degrees.

42
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,080
Back all the way, and it would tilt back 30 degrees.

43
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,420
When I release the stick, the drone would just snap back to level.

44
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,940
And that's how angle mode works.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:29,780
It's always actively trying to level out the drone or put it at the exact angle corresponding to where your stick is at.

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,680
Now, acro mode is a little different.

47
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:43,040
Instead of correlating the position of your stick with the angle of the drone, acro mode correlates the position of your stick with the speed to rotate the drone at, in that direction that your stick is in.

48
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,580
So, if I push my stick all the way forwards, the drone is going to rotate forwards really fast and keep flipping forwards until I release my stick.

49
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,840
If I push my stick halfway forwards, the drone is going to start rotating forwards at half that speed.

50
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,640
And again, it's not locked to a constant angle, so it's just going to be a constant rotation.

51
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,940
In acro mode as well, whenever you release that stick, the drone does not snap back to level like it does in angle mode.

52
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,900
It will continue on in whatever position you left it in.

53
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:22,680
So, if I used my roll stick and I rolled my drone sideways, and then I just let go of my stick, my drone would stay like this.

54
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,560
I'd have to actively roll to the left to get my drone back to level.

55
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,960
Now that you understand the basics of angle mode, the drone will always stay within a certain angle limit, and the angle corresponds to how far you're pushing the stick.

56
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:43,420
And acro mode, where there isn't a max range the drone can go, it can go wherever, and the speed at which it turns is defined by how fast you push the stick.

57
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,180
Let's dive in on how to actually fly your drone in the air, because there are some differences between the two modes.

58
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,960
And I have a system that I like to teach new pilots with that will make your first flight be really easy.

59
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,140
Alright, so first off, we're going to start in angle mode.

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,820
Switch my drone into angle mode.

61
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,580
And when you're starting out FPV, throttle control is the most important thing to learn.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:11,120
So we're going to arm our drone, and I don't recommend doing this actually out with your real FPV drone for the first time.

63
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,440
Always start learning FPV in a simulator, but I enjoy it more outside, so I'm going to teach you guys from outside.

64
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,520
First step is just to hover your drone.

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,340
You want to practice your throttle control.

66
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,920
Beginners tend to go up and down a lot, and this is, uh, it's really hard to land or bring your drone safely.

67
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,220
Take it out a little ways so I can actually hear myself talk.

68
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,600
So we're just going to practice staying at about the same height and hovering in the same spot.

69
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:39,680
And you notice I'm drifting to the right a little bit, so you're going to have to correct yourself by pushing a little bit to the left until we just stop and stay in the same position.

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,480
And I want to get a really nice constant hover.

71
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:48,340
You're going to have to adjust your throttle a bit up and down to try to keep your drone really, really, really still.

72
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,340
And with beginners, throttle control doesn't come naturally.

73
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,200
They just want to put the stick at a certain spot, and they're going to end up going up, going down, and kind of bouncing back and forth and bunny hopping.

74
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,840
So throttle control is really important for FPV drones, so that's why we're learning it first.

75
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:15,200
So once you've learned how to hover really good, just using your throttle up and down and using your right pitch and roll stick to kind of stay in the same exact spot, the next step is going to be using our pitch and roll stick to move around.

76
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,600
Not using our yaw side to side, but we're going to be using our pitch and our roll sticks here.

77
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,840
And we're going to have to use throttle.

78
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,660
We're going to have to use our throttle skills that we just learned to keep our drone in the air.

79
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:34,540
Because when you pitch to the side, your force is going to the side and not down directly, so you're going to have to use a little more throttle when you're going to the side.

80
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:48,160
Make sure you're in a big open field for that, and just kind of get the hang of flying forwards a bit, flying backwards, flying to the side, and keeping your drone not too high in the air and not crashing in the ground.

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:58,120
When you can pitch to the back, you can fly forwards, and you can fly side to side without losing too much altitude.

82
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,780
The next step we're going to do is incorporate our yaw.

83
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,580
So our yaw will actually spin it if I move it to the left here.

84
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,780
It'll spin our drone.

85
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,720
And we can use our yaw to make nice smooth turns.

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:20,020
So if I push my pitch stick forwards here and fly my drone forwards, I can now yaw to the side, and my drone will now be pointing in this new direction and flying in that new direction.

87
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,200
And that's how you do a turn with FPV in angle mode.

88
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,840
So with angle mode, you're going to want to bank a little as well.

89
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,340
So when we turn with our yaw, we're going to want to push our roll stick that way slightly as well.

90
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,620
And this is just the same as your average motorcycle track.

91
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:44,880
If you do dirt biking or motorcycles, to get a really good turn without blowing out on the track, you need to bank into it a little bit.

92
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,340
So we're going to bank and yaw at the same time.

93
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,060
In angle mode, though, you don't have to bank if you want.

94
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,920
You can just go straight forwards with your pitch stick and then yaw.

95
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,680
And your drone will turn around and start flying in the new direction.

96
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,760
So those are the three steps to learn how to fly your drone in angle mode.

97
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
You start off with the hover.

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:12,640
You get used to holding your drone at a good, nice altitude with your throttle and keeping it in that position with your pitch and your roll stick.

99
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:21,120
Next step is learning how to actually move your drone around with your pitch and your roll stick while keeping it off the ground and keeping it from going too high in the air with your throttle.

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,680
And the third step is just adding that yaw in there that spins your drone from left and right.

101
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,960
So when you're going, you can actually turn and seeing where you're going.

102
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:37,220
And with that yaw step, it's important to add a little bit of banking in there so that you don't cut your turns too wide and your drone goes in hitting into the trees.

103
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,360
Because I'm going at this height and I just turn, I'll just go sideways into the tree here.

104
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:44,260
So I'll show you guys how that actually helps me.

105
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:49,740
So if I'm going straight at the trees here, if I just yaw, I'll go into the trees a bit.

106
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,200
So I'm going to bank to the side and yaw.

107
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:58,400
And you'll see it stopped my momentum going forwards and perfectly transitioned me to going sideways.

108
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,780
So now I'm going to switch my drone into acro mode.

109
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,220
And like I mentioned before, the throttle and the yaw do not change when you're in acro mode.

110
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:13,480
So all you have to really focus about is the new steps from acro mode because it's not limited to a max angle with your right hand here.

111
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:18,980
So I'm going to take my drone off and I'm going to bring it super high in the air and just show you how acro mode works really quick.

112
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,860
Now that we're really high in the air, I'm going to show you how this works.

113
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,440
Now, like I mentioned before, the stick position in acro mode correlates to how fast your drone is spinning, not an angle.

114
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,820
So if I move my stick all the way to the right, I'm just going to keep spinning.

115
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,880
And if I move my drone just a little bit to the right, I'm going to keep spinning at a slower speed.

116
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,720
And whenever I let go of my stick, my drone stops at whatever position I left it at.

117
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,360
I'll take it up high again and show you guys that.

118
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,860
So if I want to tilt my drone forwards, I need to push it forwards and then let go once I get to the certain angle that I want to be flying at forwards.

119
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,280
Then to go back to level, I need to pull backwards on my stick to get my drone back to level.

120
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,360
The cool thing about acro mode is you can do flips.

121
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,460
So I can just drop my throttle, spin it all the way around, and let go.

122
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,500
And I do a perfect flip.

123
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,320
Now turning is a little bit different.

124
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,280
To turn in acro mode, if we just use our yaw stick, we're just going to look up in the sky.

125
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,360
And our drone is going to continue going in the same direction.

126
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,600
So we can't turn by just using our yaw in acro mode like we could in angle mode.

127
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,880
To turn in acro mode, we need to roll at the same time.

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,800
So if I yaw and roll at the same time, I'll get a nice smooth turn.

129
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,820
And depending on your camera angle, it depends on how much roll and how much yaw you need to use.

130
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,860
So you're just going to have to play around with it and find what's best for your camera angle.

131
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,120
But for most drones, you can get a pretty decent turn by using the same amount of roll as you do yaw and have a nice turn there.

132
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,760
So yeah, that is how you fly in acro mode.

133
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,300
It's a bit different and it takes a bit getting used to.

134
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,960
Most people can do it if they think about it really hard when they start out.

135
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,300
But as soon as they get into a sketchy situation, like they're going at a pole,

136
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,180
they tend to make quick moves and end up losing control of the drone and like crashing.

137
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,600
So I'd advise people to learn it in angle mode, get a feel for how your drone works,

138
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,940
and then switch to acro mode.

139
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,260
And then you can do cool stuff like this.
