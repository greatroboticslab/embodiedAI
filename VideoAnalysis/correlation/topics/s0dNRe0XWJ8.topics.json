And the reason the Betaflight defaults are the way that they are\nis that some people who don't use the defaults will have flyaways or smoked motors. So don't just dive in\nand follow these steps. This is not a safe for everyone PID tuning process. You need to pay attention\nto the gotchas and caveats. And if you do not meet all the qualifications of step one, do not proceed\nto step two, three, four, five, six, seven, go back and stop and get step one right. This is a really\naggressive tune at the end and your quad will fly amazing if it can handle it. Enough said.\nWhen the oneiden is working, when the\nmosquitoes work together are very beautiful, I don't know how toень effect the heights of the\nmost ratherigiousarius. Interesting to help one is the Ter towards Bernardino,\nthat means this isn't something that is natural for you.
