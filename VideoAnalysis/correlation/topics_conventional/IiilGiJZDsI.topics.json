      "coverage_text": "The classes that we are going to talk about in this course are not only used in power amplifiers,\nbut also used in audio amplifier circuits. The first class that we are going to examine is\nClass A Amplifier. This amplifier circuit must look familiar to you because this configuration\nis nothing else but the common emitter circuit amplifier. So we already talked about this\ncircuit and we have also seen how to design one. So let's just point out some facts about this configuration.\nOkay, so Class A Amplifier is a high gain amplifier with high linearity. In case of Class A Amplifier,\nthe conduction angle is 360 degree. As I explained in the previous course, a 360 degree conduction angle\nmeans that the amplifier device remains active for the entire time and use complete input signal.\nAs we can see in this image, there is only one active element which is nothing else but the transistor.\nSo the bias of the transistor remains on all the time, right? Due to this never turn off feature,\nClass A Amplifier provides better high frequency and feedback loop stability.\nOther than disadvantages, Class A Amplifier is easy to construct with a single device component\nand minimum parts count. Despite the advantages and high linearity, certainly it has many limitations.\nDue to continuous conduction nature, the Class A Amplifier introduce high power loss.\nAlso due to high linearity, Class A Amplifier provides distortion and noises. The power supply and the BIOS\nconstruction needs careful component selection to avoid unwanted noise and to minimize the distortion.\nSo we mentioned that Class A Amplifier has high power loss, right? This means that it emits\nheat and requires heat sink space, which sometimes is not available.\nThe efficiency is very poor in Class A Amplifiers. Theoretically, the efficiency varies between 25%\nto 30% if used with the usual configuration. The efficiency can be improved using inductively coupled\nconfiguration but the efficiency in such case is not more than 40% or 50% due to it is only suitable for\nlow signal or low power level amplification purposes. Now that we highlighted some important facts about\nthis class, let's move to Class B.\nThe Class B Amplifier is a bit different from the Class A as you can see here. It is created using two\nactive devices which conduct half of the actual cycle, in other words they conduct 180 degree of the cycle.\nSo two devices provide combined current drive for the load. If the circuit is used to provide audio\nsignal amplification, then the load is nothing else but a speaker, right? You might wonder how are these\ntransistors biased? Well, the bias is provided by the input signal, which means that the input signal\nhas to be higher than 0.6V and also the input signal has to go negative in order to bias the PMP\ntransistor. Don't worry if you don't understand how this circuit works because in the next course we\ntry to simulate some of the classes so that you get a better understanding of how they work. Now let's just\nconcentrate on theory a little bit and don't bother yourself if you don't understand exactly how the\ncircuit works. So this Class B amplifier consists of two active devices which get biased one by one\nduring the positive and negative half cycle of the sinusoidal wave and thus the signal gets pushed or\npulled to the amplified level from both positive and negative side. And by combining the result we get\ncomplete cycle across the output. Because these two active devices are turned on one after another and",

Compared to the efficiency of a Class A\namplifier which is 25 to 30 percent, the Class B amplifier can have an efficiency more than 60 percent. Also,\nthe heat dissipation is minimized in this class providing a low heat sink space. But this Class also\nhave limitations. A very profound limitation of this Class is the crossover distortion. As two devices\nprovides each half of the sinusoidal waves which are combined and joined across the output, there's a\nmismatch, in other words crossover in the region where two halves are combined. This is because when one\ndevice completes the half cycle, the other one needs to provide the same power almost at the same time\nwhen other one finishes the job.

The error provides a distortion in the\noutput signal and due to this limitation it is a major fail for precision audio amplifier applications.\nAn alternate approach to overcome the crossover distortion is to use the AB amplifier. Class AB\namplifier uses intermediate conduction angle of both Classes A and B, thus we can see the property of\nboth Class A and Class B amplifier in this AB class of amplifier topology. Same as Class B, it has the same\nconfiguration with two active devices which conducts during half of the cycles individually, but each\ndevice bias differently so they do not get completely off during the unusable moment or the crossover moment.\nEach device does not leave the conduction immediately after completing the half of the sinusoidal waveform,\ninstead they conduct a small amount of input on another half cycle. Using this biasing technique,\nthe crossover mismatch during the dead zone is dramatically reduced. But in this configuration,\nefficiency is reduced as the linearity of the devices is compromised. The efficiency remains more\nthan the efficiency of typical Class A amplifier, but it is less than the Class B amplifier system.",
