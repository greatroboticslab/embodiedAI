Hi everyone and welcome. I was looking on AliExpress recently and I came across this.

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:27,240
This is a little audio amplifier kit and it's based on the LM386 audio amplifier and I thought

3
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,000
this would be really good fun to try out with this. This is a little personal FM radio kit that I

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,360
recently did a review on so if you're interested please pop across my channel. This only cost three

5
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,200
dollars but obviously it's designed to just take a headphone or a connection there rather than a

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,500
speaker. I thought this would be really good fun to see how it sounded through this little amplifier.

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:57,220
So let's open this up and see what we've got. You get a little circuit diagram as you can see.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,180
there but to be honest the PC board itself actually comes with all the components identified on so

9
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:10,240
hopefully construction shouldn't be too much of a problem. The LM386 itself this is the LM386 N1

10
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,360
version and the N1 is good for around about 325 milliwatts so that's plenty to be honest just to

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,280
drive a small speaker. Luckily it comes in an 8 pin DIL package that's really neat because a lot of the

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,220
kits also provide sort of SMD sort of versions or surface mount versions and they're a real pain to

13
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,960
solder. They even give you a little 8 pin sort of socket there for it which is a neat touch.

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,620
Volume control that also is full size rather than a skeleton type and it will give you a little knob

15
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:44,300
there just to sort of make life just a little bit easier. So even though this is budget they've

16
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,960
actually put a little bit of thought into it. So what I'm going to do now I'm going to assemble it,

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,840
I'll solder it all up and then we're going to see how she's sound so let's get on with the build.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:31,140
Okay so our little amplifier board now is fully populated. I'm also connected up a loud speaker,

19
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,060
simply just connecting to the audio output pins there as you can see. I also made up a small power

20
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,120
supply in the shape of a PP3 clip connected to a small female jack. Just remember to make the center

21
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,080
pin there the positive. I'm just going to connect this up now to our little amplifier board. LED light

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
comes on which is good. What I'm going to do is I'm going to pop up on the screen for you the schematic

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,640
diagram for this little amplifier. The reason for doing this is this little LM386 chip has actually

24
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,660
got a neat little party trick. It's as much as you can actually adjust the gain. If you look at pins 1

25
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,060
and 8 then if there's nothing connected to them then the internal resistance sets the gain at 20.

26
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:13,680
However if you connect a 10 microparad capacitor between pins 1 and 8 then the gain is increased to

27
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,640
200 and in fact that's what our little board has got. If you want something in between simply put a

28
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,760
1.2k resistor in series with that capacitor and the gain reduces to around about 50. Okay back to our

29
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,520
little amplifier then. What I want to do is just connect up this little personal FM radio kit that I spoke

30
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,600
about earlier in the video and just see as you perform. So I'm just going to simply just connect to

31
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:44,800
the audio out and then connect to the audio in on the board. I'm going to put the speaker on the cloth

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,320
because it can vibrate on this board a little bit. I'm going to turn it up.

33
00:03:48,320 --> 00:04:01,040
the volume works okay.

34
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,080
That's actually not bad. What I'm going to do is just connect up a little mp3 player and just see

35
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,360
how that performs. What I've got is this little TDV26. This is a useful little device to be honest.

36
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,560
It's an FM radio come mp3 player. It's also got bluetooth. It's a brick on the back if you wish it.

37
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
But it's only cost a few dollars and I've actually done a review on this if you want to pop a

38
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
graph on channel and have a look at that. I'm simply just going to connect to the audio out on that.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:06,800
So I'm just going to pop a USB stick in there. Connect up to the audio out. Let's switch it on.

40
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:32,720
That's actually not bad at all. I'm just going to switch that off.

41
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:43,600
Okay so there you have it. It's a little LM386 audio amplifier kit. To be honest for the price it's an

42
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,240
absolute bargain. You can keep yourself a few of these because perhaps you want to do some audio

43
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,280
work or maybe repair radios and you just want a trusted amplifier just so you can look at the

44
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,360
front end of your radios. There's all sorts of things you can do with this. So anyway appreciate

45
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
you watching. Hopefully you found it useful. If you did give me that thumbs up. As always appreciate you

46
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
watching and I'll catch up with you soon.
