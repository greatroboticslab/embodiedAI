Please could you give a list of everything you used and ratings of each of the electrical components?   With like a circuit diagram or connection diagram

What is specific name of vacuum motor

Hlo bro contact number tharumo

And many people asking how much every parts - I made few versions of robot  ( from very basic to advanced  (multi ESP32) now also speaking / SMS/Email /control farm / protect home)  - so I will share the cost and pros and cons of each solution.

Good but no furniture :)  - nice training. I put QMC5883 compass - cheap way to know the North so robot faster recognizes direction  and finds fast ,right  door to entrance/exit  - I will show soon on YT Now the mecanum wheel  - 80mm - set 4 wheel  (remember 2R+2L) cost 12 USD - so good idea. And ESP32 ( same price UNO )  but much better.

Hello, great job. I can add MPU6050 gyroscope sensor to this work. can you give me some insight on how to add. thanks in advance for the reply!!!

How to connect a lot of sensor? Do you solder the jumper wire?

👍👍👍👍👍

what did you use for the frame?

what board is in use?

Great job. Clean design. Lightweight frame.

Can you tell me that can I connect brush less 30a battery instead of 40A

Can you please tell me that the connection of ardiuno how you done you can give me chart

please share the materials.

Hello

Hey hey can u provide the block diagram

Bro, what material is used for case.. (that white colour body)?? Pls reply, urgent 🛑🛑

is it possible to tell me the motor that used for vacuum?

I put QMC5883 compass - cheap way to know the North so robot faster recognizes direction  and finds right  door to entrance/exit  - I will show soon on YT

better buy shield/board for uno (or ESP ) with screw - 2 USD  - wire is good for table or if you don't have money

Sunboard is used for the case

how much did this cost you to build, a really interesting project

Can you explain the code in more details?!

Me to have same doubt

کرم خره مال منه

Me to have the same doubt

Can you please tell what is that motor ?

Can you please tell what type of motor he used for suction?

@trippyflyeryt178  surely it is a brushless motor of three phases, with its controller and the servo tester to control the speed.

@taielrenzi1051  what is name red module?

@mohammadmahdirezayati1264  H-Bridge Motor Driver

He using bug converter reduce voltage then speed too

Did you got what is that ?

@trippyflyeryt178  no

What is that motor he used for suction?

I can't make it work my friend pls reply

Can you tell me the curcits of uno because I. Can't understand it

Nice work!

Great man

Can we set an Avc motor bro

Can u tell what was the cost for making this robot and also can u please name the components used .it will be really helpful.

Fantastic job..and Fantastic presentation👍👍👍

Can u fix ur code plz I can't see

Copy cat !!!! Offical video here from a Vietnamese youtuber:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ner4vUtxVMo
