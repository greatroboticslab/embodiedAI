[00:00:00.000 → 00:00:11.380] Sometimes when building circuits mistakes can happen, which can be a reverse voltage,
[00:00:11.380 → 00:00:17.800] a voltage applied to the wrong pin, components failing due to their age or wrong usage or
[00:00:17.800 → 00:00:20.820] you simply accidentally short something.
[00:00:20.820 → 00:00:26.520] No matter the cause, the now appearing overcurrent is the root of all evil that needs to get
[00:00:26.520 → 00:00:31.360] stopped so that nothing explodes or burns down completely.
[00:00:31.360 → 00:00:37.340] To do that I think pretty much everyone is familiar with such glass fuses that you just
[00:00:37.340 → 00:00:43.040] put in series to your circuit and as soon as too much current is flowing the thin metal
[00:00:43.040 → 00:00:47.500] inside of it melts and thus interrupts the current flow.
[00:00:47.500 → 00:00:51.780] Only problem is that replacing such fuses can be cumbersome.
[00:00:51.780 → 00:00:57.900] It can get expensive if you are testing stuff and constantly destroy them and in case of
[00:00:57.900 → 00:01:04.700] enclosed electronics like your smartphone there is simply no way to replace such a fuse.
[00:01:04.700 → 00:01:11.620] The solution to all these problems though are resettable fuses like these ones which I often
[00:01:11.620 → 00:01:14.940] feel like not many people know about.
[00:01:14.940 → 00:01:20.340] So in this video I will show you exactly how to use them and with what limitations they
[00:01:20.340 → 00:01:21.780] come with.
[00:01:21.780 → 00:01:28.100] Because even though they are resettable and thus reusable they are certainly not perfect.
[00:01:28.100 → 00:01:38.520] Let's get started!
[00:01:38.520 → 00:01:42.020] This video is sponsored by Mauser Electronics.
[00:01:42.020 → 00:01:47.900] Now truth be told I've been searching for fitting resettable fuses for a while on the internet.
[00:01:47.900 → 00:01:53.860] Mauser was the only seller that not only came with a big selection of them but most of them
[00:01:53.860 → 00:02:00.040] were also in stock, I could easily filter for preferences and best of all they sell to
[00:02:00.040 → 00:02:04.660] private people like you and me and not just companies.
[00:02:04.660 → 00:02:10.980] I have been ordering my components from them since 2018 and I can tell you for sure that they
[00:02:10.980 → 00:02:14.100] have all the components you could ever need.
[00:02:14.100 → 00:02:19.780] And you usually receive them within 3 or sometimes even only 2 days.
[00:02:19.780 → 00:02:25.420] So feel free to check out Mauser Electronics if I piqued your interest.
[00:02:25.420 → 00:02:30.660] Now first off if you want to use resettable fuses then you always have the choice between the
[00:02:30.660 → 00:02:37.740] through hole ones that I feel like are easier to use and small SMD ones which you probably
[00:02:37.740 → 00:02:42.400] already have seen on devices like the Raspberry Pi.
[00:02:42.400 → 00:02:48.880] Sometimes resettable fuses are also known as a multi fuse, poly fuse or poly switch but
[00:02:48.880 → 00:02:54.780] if we want to be technically correct then they are actually called PPTC which stands for
[00:02:54.780 → 00:03:02.660] Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient device and wait a minute PTCs are actually quite
[00:03:02.660 → 00:03:04.360] popular.
[00:03:04.360 → 00:03:09.320] What they do and what their name basically implies is that they increase their resistance when
[00:03:09.320 → 00:03:11.160] they get hotter.
[00:03:11.160 → 00:03:17.460] You can actually find their relative the NTC aka Negative Temperature Coefficient on lots
[00:03:17.460 → 00:03:24.040] of 3D printers because they decrease their resistance when their temperature rises and thus they both
[00:03:24.040 → 00:03:26.820] can be used to measure temperature.
[00:03:26.820 → 00:03:31.740] But back to the resettable fuse which does in fact increase its resistance when temperature
[00:03:31.740 → 00:03:38.960] rises but it still features lots of differences to normal PTCs or NTCs.
[00:03:38.960 → 00:03:44.580] So as a practical example let's say I got a circuit that normally draws around 500mA at
[00:03:44.580 → 00:03:51.820] 12V like this RGB LED strip right here and I want to protect it from shorts so that the
[00:03:51.820 → 00:03:55.260] fitting power supply does not get damaged.
[00:03:55.260 → 00:04:01.440] Now to choose a suitable resettable fuse we only have to worry about 4 crucial properties
[00:04:01.440 → 00:04:08.000] and those are the maximum voltage and current as well as the hold current and trip current.
[00:04:08.000 → 00:04:13.580] And I think the maximum voltage and current is pretty self explanatory meaning that if you
[00:04:13.580 → 00:04:18.220] exceed them you basically risk damaging your fuse.
[00:04:18.220 → 00:04:25.340] The hold and trip current is a tiny bit more complicated but still pretty easy to understand.
[00:04:25.340 → 00:04:30.700] The hold current basically stands for the current that can flow continuously without having to
[00:04:30.700 → 00:04:34.440] worry about that the fuse will ever trip.
[00:04:34.440 → 00:04:40.480] And the trip current of course is the current that needs to flow so that the fuse will activate
[00:04:40.480 → 00:04:43.540] and thus interrupt the over current.
[00:04:43.540 → 00:04:45.140] Pretty simple.
[00:04:45.140 → 00:04:51.320] So with these 4 rough values in mind for my circuit I went on to a search on Mauser Electronics
[00:04:51.320 → 00:05:00.900] and decided on this PPTC that can do 60V and 40A max and comes with a hold current of 0.5A and
[00:05:00.900 → 00:05:03.620] a trip current of 1A.
[00:05:03.620 → 00:05:08.780] And if you are asking yourself right now why not use a fuse with slightly higher ratings for
[00:05:08.780 → 00:05:15.000] a bit of wiggle room then just wait a few more minutes for a little revelation.
[00:05:15.000 → 00:05:21.500] Because first off it was time for a small experiment in which I simulated my to be protected circuit
[00:05:21.500 → 00:05:27.680] with a constant load to which I of course added my resettable fuse in series and powered it
[00:05:27.680 → 00:05:30.220] all with 12V.
[00:05:30.220 → 00:05:35.560] Now by slowly increasing the current flow through my fuse I also directly measured and wrote
[00:05:35.560 → 00:05:38.220] down the voltage drop across it.
[00:05:38.220 → 00:05:44.060] Because those electrical values give us insight about the power the fuse wastes which directly
[00:05:44.060 → 00:05:50.440] determines its temperature and also what resistance it currently possesses.
[00:05:50.440 → 00:05:57.100] So first big stop was the hold current of 500mA at which point only a small voltage drop across
[00:05:57.100 → 00:06:03.720] the fuse occurred that at some point also did not increase anymore meaning the temperature
[00:06:03.720 → 00:06:09.600] of the fuse was stable and thus it would never trip at this point.
[00:06:09.600 → 00:06:16.160] Next was the trip current of 1A and here the voltage drop did in fact increase over time until
[00:06:16.160 → 00:06:22.100] the fuse ultimately reached its high resistance state in which my constant load could no longer
[00:06:22.100 → 00:06:25.880] draw 1A and thus turned off.
[00:06:25.880 → 00:06:31.560] Now you might be thinking that these 22-6 seconds it took for the fuse to activate are way too
[00:06:31.560 → 00:06:40.580] long but as a comparison let's see how a 1A rated glass fuse would react to 1A of current.
[00:06:40.580 → 00:06:47.320] And yes we could sit here forever because the glass fuse would never trip and even at 2A it
[00:06:47.320 → 00:06:53.880] still took way longer to activate once again in direct comparison to the resettable fuse.
[00:06:53.880 → 00:07:00.440] So yeah PPTCs are a bit slow but traditional fuses are even slower.
[00:07:00.440 → 00:07:06.440] But getting back to topic because next to truly investigate the trip occurrence I added a big
[00:07:06.440 → 00:07:12.500] power resistor as a load that would normally draw around 1.2A.
[00:07:12.500 → 00:07:18.820] And by the way these 3 components I added in parallel to the fuse are just a trip indicator
[00:07:18.820 → 00:07:24.060] which lights up as soon as the fuse enters its high resistance state.
[00:07:24.060 → 00:07:30.260] Ok so now with the resettable fuse in place the big current the resistor normally draws got
[00:07:30.260 → 00:07:35.560] quickly limited to only around 103mA.
[00:07:35.560 → 00:07:41.260] But wait a minute shouldn't a fuse cut down the flowing current to nothing like a normal
[00:07:41.260 → 00:07:43.560] glass fuse would do?
[00:07:43.560 → 00:07:49.940] Well such PPTCs cannot do that because they are basically just resistors whose resistance
[00:07:49.940 → 00:07:55.760] increases drastically at the trip current because of the rising temperature.
[00:07:55.760 → 00:08:01.040] That does not mean they are useless though because such a drastic current reduction can definitely
[00:08:01.040 → 00:08:07.580] prevent exploding capacitors, smoking transistors or even save battery packs when things go
[00:08:07.580 → 00:08:09.960] accidentally wrong.
[00:08:09.960 → 00:08:15.840] And speaking of battery packs PPTCs also often get used with them since they drip when they
[00:08:15.840 → 00:08:22.980] get hot and battery packs definitely love to get hot when they are not handled correctly.
[00:08:22.980 → 00:08:29.100] But getting back to the trip event at which point a so called leakage current keeps flowing
[00:08:29.100 → 00:08:35.420] that basically keeps the fuse hot enough so that it stays in its high resistance state.
[00:08:35.420 → 00:08:40.900] I also did some additional measurements in this state to find out that no matter what input
[00:08:40.900 → 00:08:48.880] voltage gets applied the resettable fuse basically creates a power loss of around 1.2W which is
[00:08:48.880 → 00:08:52.720] quite a bit more than what the datasheet claims.
[00:08:52.720 → 00:08:58.860] And speaking of datasheet this is a good time to try out a PPTC with slightly higher ratings.
[00:08:58.860 → 00:09:06.440] Like this one that holds at 0.9A and triggers at 1.8A.
[00:09:06.440 → 00:09:10.740] I pretty much did the same tests and measurements as before.
[00:09:10.740 → 00:09:17.260] And the differences are that the bigger fuse features less power losses during normal operation
[00:09:17.260 → 00:09:20.900] but wastes more power when it got tripped.
[00:09:20.900 → 00:09:25.400] So the choice is up to you what is more important for you.
[00:09:25.400 → 00:09:31.280] Now the last thing we have to take a look at is the area between the hold and trip current.
[00:09:31.280 → 00:09:36.900] And here the resettable fuse can trigger but does not have to.
[00:09:36.900 → 00:09:44.520] For example at 700mA the voltage drop and thus temperature only increases very slowly.
[00:09:44.520 → 00:09:50.900] Meaning eventually this fuse might drip if the ambient temperature is also high.
[00:09:50.900 → 00:09:57.720] But at 900mA the voltage and temperature increases way faster and thus the fuse tripped in my
[00:09:57.720 → 00:10:02.800] case after around 1 minute and 42 seconds.
[00:10:02.800 → 00:10:08.420] This typical time to trip diagram given by the datasheet can also help you out a lot regarding
[00:10:08.420 → 00:10:10.660] those questions.
[00:10:10.660 → 00:10:16.980] And by the way the PPTC also becomes rather quickly conductive again as soon as the current
[00:10:16.980 → 00:10:18.660] decreases.
[00:10:18.660 → 00:10:24.460] But after tripping once its resistance will take quite a long time until it will reach
[00:10:24.460 → 00:10:27.460] its initial value once again.
[00:10:27.460 → 00:10:32.020] And with that being said you should now be familiar with most of the basics when it comes
[00:10:32.020 → 00:10:34.340] to resettable fuses.
[00:10:34.340 → 00:10:40.260] And yes they are definitely a good fit for the LED strip example we started with and they
[00:10:40.260 → 00:10:45.280] are also a standard when it comes to many other protection tasks.
[00:10:45.280 → 00:10:52.400] Of course traditional fuses are a bit more efficient, meaning they produce less power losses.
[00:10:52.400 → 00:10:58.220] But then again E-fuses which I presented you in a previous video pretty much come with the
[00:10:58.220 → 00:11:02.100] same low power losses as traditional fuses.
[00:11:02.100 → 00:11:08.080] And even better they do trip in a way more precise and fast way, since they do not rely
[00:11:08.080 → 00:11:14.080] on a rising temperature that burns a metal or increases a resistance.
[00:11:14.080 → 00:11:21.220] But then again such an E-fuse is a bit more complicated to set up, it is more expensive and also not
[00:11:21.220 → 00:11:23.780] resettable by itself.
[00:11:23.780 → 00:11:29.720] They can also only be used for limited voltage and current range, while the resettable fuses
[00:11:29.720 → 00:11:36.160] can handle quite a bit more and traditional fuses are beasts in that regard.
[00:11:36.160 → 00:11:41.520] What I am trying to say here is that each one of these fuse types is tailored to a specific
[00:11:41.520 → 00:11:47.400] application and I feel like with this video coming to an end you should now have a very
[00:11:47.400 → 00:11:50.760] good idea when to use which one.
[00:11:50.760 → 00:11:54.380] I hope you enjoyed it and learned something new.
