The components need to make the tester are BC547, three resistors, one red LED light, one green LED light, a 12-volt power supply, and a multimeter. You connect the LED lights to the resistors and the BC547. After making the connections as shown in the video you can connect the circuit to the multimeter and the power supply. This circuit works to test if different circuit components are good to use. The way the circuit work is that when you are testing a broken item using the multimeter probes the LED lights turn red. In the other hand when an item is good to use it tuns green making it easy to identify bad circuit elements.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxMkX0wtLm4&t=18s: Make all component Tester using BC547, Make a universal any components tester."}, {"correlated": false, "score": 0, "reason": "The comment is about building an electronic tester using diodes and a transistor to determine the correct direction of voltage use on components. This has no relation to music, which was described in the topic.", "comment": "Utilizing some diodes and a bc 547 transistor to create a tester for the correct direction of voltage use on other components. I think this is one that I will make myself to use, this is very useful, and makes finding the direction so quick. I guess I could just use a multimeter since it is mostly a basic continuity tester, but very cool way to build with minimum components.", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxMkX0wtLm4: Make all component Tester using BC547, Make a universal any components"}]}
